1.02.040 Preliminary Determination of Violation.
(1) Whenever it appears that a prohibited act may have been done, a required act may have been omitted, a prohibited condition may exist, or otherwise there may have been a violation of this code, the code enforcement officer investigates the matter as warranted to determine whether there is a code violation. If the alleged violation came to the officer’s attention by way of a written complaint and, after investigation, a code violation is not found, the officer should inform the complainant of the finding.
(2) If the officer finds a violation, the officer may attempt to secure voluntary correction by contacting the responsible person(s), explaining the violation and requesting correction before issuing a notice of violation or notice of civil infraction. (Ord. 99-24 §4, 1999; Ord. 82-6 §5, 1982).

(a) the citing officer serving the notice of civil infraction on the person named in the notice of civil infraction at the time of issuance; or
(b) the citing officer or the prosecuting authority filing the notice of civil infraction with the court, in which case the court has the notice served either personally or by mail, postage pre-paid, on the person named in the notice of civil infraction at his or her address. If a notice of civil infraction served by mail is returned to the court as undeliverable, the court issues a summons.
(3) Filing. When a notice of civil infraction has been issued, the notice is filed with the municipal court within forty-eight hours after issuance, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, except parking violations.
(Ord. 99-24 §7, 1999)
1.02.070 Person Receiving Notice - Identification and Detention.

identification, including a driver’s license or identicard.
(2) A person who is unable or unwilling to reasonably identify himself or herself to an enforcement officer may be detained for a period of time no longer than is reasonably necessary to identify the person for purposes of issuing a civil infraction.

At the request of a person responsible, the code enforcement officer will re-inspect to determine if correction of the violation has been accomplished. If so, the officer will sign and provide to such person responsible a certificate of
correction. If at least forty-eight hours prior to the hearing on the infraction, the person responsible presents a certificate of correction to the municipal court, the infraction will be dismissed. (Ord. 99-24 §14, 1999)

1.05.010 Declaration of Policy.
1.05.020 Code of Ethics.
1.05.030 Disclosure and Reporting of Conflict of Interest.
1.05.010 Declaration of Policy. High moral and ethical standards among public officials and public employees are essential to gain and maintain the confidence of the public because such confidence is essential to the conduct of free government. Public officials and public employees are agents of the people and hold their positions for the benefit of the people. The proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent and impartial when establishing policy and that their positions never be used for personal gain. A code of ethical conduct is necessary for the guidance of public officials where conflicts do occur as well as to prevent conflicts of interest.
(Ord. 15-13 §2, 2015).
1.05.020 Code of Ethics. The purpose of the code of ethics is to assist City officials and employees to establish guidelines to govern their own conduct as it relates to official City business. The code is also intended to help develop traditions of responsible public service. This code shall apply to all members of the City Council, Planning Commission, and other City Boards and Commissions as well as all City employees and appointed officers. An official or employee shall be deemed to have violated this code if he or she:
(1) Receives or has any financial interest in any sale to or by the City of any service or property when such financial interest was received with the prior knowledge that the City intended to purchase such property or obtain such service;
(2) Accepts or seeks for others any service, information or thing of value on more favorable terms than those granted to the public generally, from any person, firm or corporation having dealings with the City;
(3) Accepts any material gift or favor from any person, firm or corporation having any dealings with the City if he or she knows or has reason to know that it was intended to obtain special consideration;
(4) Influences the selection of or the conduct of business with a corporation, person or firm having business with the City if he or she personally or through household relatives has financial interest in or with the corporation, person or firm;
(5) Is an employee, officer, partner, director or consultant of any corporation, firm or person having business with the City, unless he or she has disclosed such relationship as provided by this chapter; provided, that nothing herein shall be deemed to apply to consultants who render professional advice to corporations, firms or persons on matters unrelated to the business with the City. This provision shall not apply if the official or employee disqualifies himself or herself from all participation in the City business with the corporation, firm or person;
(6) Engages in or accepts private employment or renders services for private industry when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties, would impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties, or would require or induce him or her to disclose confidential information acquired by reason of his or her official position;
(7) Appears on behalf of a private interest before any regulatory governmental agency against the interest of the City, or represents a private interest in any action or proceeding against the interest of the City in any litigation to which the City is a party, unless he or she has a personal interest and this personal interest has been disclosed to the regulatory governmental agency. A City Councilmember may appear before regulatory governmental agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of his or her duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations; however, no official or employee shall accept a retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by a City agency;
(8) Directly or indirectly possess a substantial or controlling interest in any business entity which
conducts business or contracts with the City, or in the sale of real estate, materials, supplies or services to the City, without disclosing such interest as provided by this chapter. An interest is not a substantial interest if such interest does not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the outstanding securities of the business concern; or, if the interest is an unincorporated business concern, one percent of the net worth of such concern, or the financial interest of a corporation, person or firm does not exceed five percent of the net worth of the employee and his or her household relatives;
(9) As a City Councilmember, has a financial or other private interest in any legislation or other matters coming before the council and fails to disclose such an interest on the records of the City Council. This provision shall not apply if the City Councilmember disqualifies himself or herself from voting by stating the nature and extent of such interest. Any other official or employee who has a financial or other private interest, and who participates in discussion with or gives an official opinion to the City Council and fails to disclose on the records of the City Council the nature and extent of such interest is in violation of this chapter;
(10) Violates any ordinance or resolution of the City;
(11) Discloses confidential information gained by reason of his or her official position or otherwise uses such information for his or her personal gain or benefit;
(12) Makes any false statement or representation of any public record or document in a willful disregard of the truth of such statement or representation;
(13) Request or permit the use of City-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience, improper purposes, or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as City policy for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business;
(14) Grants any special consideration, treatment or advantage beyond that which is available to every other citizen in similar circumstances;
(15) Violates any provision of Chapter 42.20 or 42.23 RCW;
(16) Violates the appearance of fairness doctrine in Chapter 42.36 RCW.
(Ord. 17-6 §1, 2017; Ord. 15-13 §3, 2015)
1.05.030 Disclosure and Reporting of Conflict of Interest.
(1) Upon accepting a position with the City of Pullman as an employee, officer, elected or appointed official, or agent, it is the responsibility of the individual to immediately disclose any potential, real, or apparent conflicts of interest to the City Administrator or designee.
(2) All City of Pullman employees, officers, elected or appointed officials, or agents, during the course of their affiliation with the City of Pullman, shall take steps to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest and shall report any potential conflict immediately to the City Administrator or designee for appropriate action. It is the responsibility of all individuals and vendors associated with the City of Pullman to report any activity that is suspected to be in violation of the basic principles of this Code of Ethics.

1.14.005 City policy on diversity in the workplace. The city of Pullman recognizes that continued success in meeting the needs of the community requires the full and active participation of talented and committed individuals - regardless of their respective race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental disabilities, and social, economic, or cultural background - and that only by fostering an environment of recognition and acceptance, can we begin to appreciate and support the strengths afforded by the range of problem solving styles, communication skills, ideas, and organizational contributions of each and every person.
Diversity is inclusion. It stresses equal employment opportunity, and recognizes and respects the multitude of differences that employees bring to the workplace, as well as acknowledging the changing diversity of our community. The
ultimate goal of workplace diversity is to attract, hire, retain, and successfully manage the inclusion of individuals, representing different lifestyles, cultures, values, and ideas into our organization.
It is the city’s policy, therefore, to have a workforce that reflects the diverse composition of our community. To that end, department heads, managers, and supervisors responsible for hiring and/or promotional decisions, are charged with making good faith effort to achieve employment diversity within their area of responsibility. Diversity will be achieved when the city - at all organizational levels - recognizes the true value of a diverse workforce and is comfortable selecting and retaining individuals from diverse backgrounds, including them in our organizational culture, and utilizing their full range of potential.
(Ord. 98-41 §2, 1998).

Each applicant shall receive a fair evaluation of his or her qualifications when being considered for a position or for a promotion.
(Ord. 97-34 §12, 1997; Ord. B-271 §2, 1976).

(2) If the emergency requires procurements before City Council action, the Mayor may declare an emergency situation exists, waive public bidding requirements, and award all necessary contracts on behalf of the city to address the emergency situation. If a contract is awarded without public bidding due to an emergency, a written finding of the existence of an emergency must be made by the City Council no later than two weeks following the award of the contract.

(3) Negotiations for Architect and Engineer Services.
(a) A contract shall be negotiated with the most qualified firm at a fair and reasonable price for the city. In making this determination, the Public Works Director shall consider the estimated value of the services to be rendered, as well as the scope, complexity and professional nature thereof.

packaging material that do not contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) except when it is not cost-effective or technically feasible to do so.

However, the department may accept from businesses, manufacturers, organizations, and individuals results obtained from an accredited laboratory or testing facility in accordance with a state or EPA approved Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), documenting product or packaging material PCB levels. The department may request suppliers of products to provide testing data from an accredited laboratory or testing facility documenting the testing method and product or packaging material PCB levels.
(3) The City may develop procedures to implement the preference set forth above, which are consistent with and do not conflict with the provisions of this subsection. (Ord. 15-14 §1, 2015).

The following provisions are applicable to solid waste containers for removal of solid waste pursuant to the provisions of 5.40.040.
(1) Required. The person in charge of a premises shall keep a sufficient number of solid waste containers on that premises for the collection of solid waste from that premises. A sufficient number of solid waste containers is that number which will allow solid waste to be collected and removed from the premises consistent with the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section.
In interpreting the requirements of this subsection (1), it shall be understood that
(a) when a premises is a unit of a duplex, triplex, or quadplex, service for the collection of solid waste from that premises may be shared with one or more of the other units of the duplex, triplex, or quadplex if the shared service is obtained by the use of a dumpster or a self-contained, liquid-tight
compacting solid waste container as opposed to a garbage can for shared service which is not allowed, except as provided in subparagraph 1(c).
(b) the residents of a unit or units of one duplex, triplex, or quadplex complex may share solid waste collection service with residents of another unit or units in a different duplex, triplex, or quadplex complex if a dumpster or self-contained, liquid-tight, compacting solid waste container as compared to a garbage can is used for solid waste collection; and the duplexes, triplexes, or quadplexes are located on adjoining properties, and are owned by the same person. In no case may any combination of duplex, triplexes, or quadplexes greater than two (2) buildings share solid waste collection service, except as provided in subpara-graph 1(c).
(c) Two units of a duplex, triplex, or quadplex may share the use of a sixty-eight gallon solid waste container of a type that can be emptied by a solid waste collector using an automated system. A sixty-eight gallon solid waste container may not be shared by any more than two units of a duplex, triplex, or quadplex.
(d) shared service allowed under (a) or (b) above does not relieve the person in charge of a premises that includes a duplex, triplex, or quadplex from the requirement that each unit thereof shall be a rate payer in the mandatory curbside recycling program.
(2) Use. The person in charge of a premises shall assure that
(a) all solid waste is collected from that premises.
(b) except as provided in subsection (3), all solid waste is deposited in solid waste containers, and under no circumstances is garbage deposited in any container other than a solid waste container.
(c) hot ashes are not deposited in solid waste containers.
(d) solid waste containers other than dumpsters and self-contained, liquid-tight, compacting solid waste containers do not weigh more than seventy-five pounds when full.
(e) each lid to a solid waste container is tightly in place at all times except when solid waste is being placed in or removed from the solid waste container.
(f) the contents of each solid waste container flows freely from it at the time it is emptied by a solid waste collector using the normal method of emptying that particular type of solid waste container.
(g) solid waste containers are properly and timely placed for collection of solid waste on the premises and removal of solid waste from the premises.
(3) Exceptions.
(a) Boxes and crating. Large wooden, cardboard, and synthetic boxes and crating that will not collapse to a size which easily fits into the largest solid waste container on the premises may be left near a solid waste container for removal and disposal by a solid waste collector,
(i) if they are collapsed and bundled to a size and weight which allows all of the bundle to be easily picked up by a solid waste collector; and,
(ii) if the bundle is sufficiently secured for it and its contents to remain in place until picked up by a solid waste collector.
(b) Prunings. Prunings of trees, bushes, and other vegetation, and other yard waste that do not easily fit into the largest solid waste container on the premises may be left near a solid waste container for removal and disposal by a solid waste collector,
(i) if they are cut and bundled or packaged to a size and shape which allows all of the bundle or package to be easily picked up by a solid waste collector; and,
(ii) if the bundle or package is sufficiently secured for it and its contents to remain in place until picked up by a solid waste collector.
(c) Recyclable solid waste. The recycling of recyclable solid waste materials is highly encouraged. Curbside pickup of recyclable solid waste is the most efficient method of accomplishing this recycling goal. Solid waste for waste recycling such as glass containers, aluminum and tin cans, plastic containers, cardboard, news-papers, and other commercially marketable items for which the solid waste collector serving that pre-mises has a market and is willing to remove and dispose of may be collected by a solid waste col-lector.

9.20.040 Animal disturbance noises--Prohibited. Enforcement.
(1) Animal disturbance noises--Prohibited. Subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth in this section, the
keeper of any animal shall not keep or maintain within the city any animal which by frequent repetitive or continuous howling, yelping, barking, braying, whinnying, crying, cackling, crowing, squealing, or the making of any other noises annoys or disturbs the peace and repose of persons of reasonable sensitivities residing, owning property, or employed within a district zoned for residential uses.
(2) Animal disturbance noises--Enforcement. Enforcement of 9.20.040(1) shall be undertaken only upon receipt of a complaint by an identifiable person who resides, owns property, or is employed within a residential district affected by the noise complained of. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the procedure for enforcing 9.20.040(1) shall be as follows:
(a) A code enforcement officer or police officer shall verify that the animal disturbance noise complained of is being received at the location in a residential zone district complainant claims it is being received. The opinion of an officer as to the loudness or objectionability of the animal disturbance noise is not material in the enforcement of 9.20.040(1), but the opinion of complainants is material.
(b) After verification, a code enforcement officer or police officer shall make a reasonable attempt to notify the keeper at the location of the source of the animal disturbance noise complained of and inform that person that an animal disturbance noise complaint has been received from a person residing, owning property, or employed in a district zoned for residential purposes, and warn that if other complaints are received a notice or notices of infraction will be issued to the keeper for either a daytime or nighttime animal disturbance noise infraction as set forth in 9.20.040(3) or 9.20.040 (4).
As used in this subsection (b), the term "reasonable attempt" means that a code enforcement officer or a police officer has physically visited the premises from which the animal disturbance noise complaint has generated and personally notified or attempted to notify the keeper that an animal disturbance noise complaint has been received. If a code enforcement officer or police officer cannot find a keeper on the premises to notify that an animal disturbance noise complaint
has been received, the requirement of a reasonable attempt to do so has been satisfied if the officer leaves a warning notice of infraction in a conspicuous place on the premises.
(c) Upon receipt of a second identifiable complaint within the applicable time periods set forth in 9.20.040(3) or 9.20.040(4) from a person other than a first complainant who resides in a different residence, owns different property, or is employed at a different location than that of a first complainant, a code enforcement officer or police officer after verification of receipt of the animal disturbance noise at the second location and without further warning shall issue a notice of infraction to the keeper of the animal or animals causing the animal disturbance noise.
(d) The observations of a code enforcement officer or police officer satisfy the requirement for a second identifiable complaint without need for further warnings.
(3) Daytime animal disturbance noise. Animal disturbance noise complaints received between the hours of 7:00 o'clock a.m. to 10:00 o'clock p.m. on any given day shall be considered as daytime animal disturbance noise complaints.
(4) Nighttime animal disturbance noises. Animal disturbance noise complaints received between the hours of 10:00 o'clock p.m. on any given day to 7:00 o'clock a.m. on the following day shall be considered as nighttime animal disturbance noise complaints.
(5) Failure to comply--daytime; nighttime.
(a) Daytime. Each daytime animal disturbance noise complaint received from a different identifiable complainant during the same daytime period after the issuance of a daytime notice of infraction shall be cause for issuing subsequent notices of infraction for a daytime animal disturbance noise without the necessity of giving another warning prior to issuing any subsequent daytime notices of infraction. These subsequent daytime notices of infraction shall be issued for failure to comply with the original daytime notice of infraction.
(b) Nighttime. Each nighttime animal disturbance noise complaint received from a different identifiable
complainant during the same nighttime period after the issuance of a nighttime notice of infraction shall be cause for issuing subsequent notices of infraction for a nighttime animal disturbance noise without the necessity of giving another warning prior to issuing any subsequent nighttime notices of infraction. These subsequent nighttime notices of infraction shall be issued for failure to comply with the original nighttime notice of infraction.
(Ord. 14-13 §9, 2014; Ord. 00-25 §7, 2000; Ord. 99-41 §9, 1999; Ord. No. 90-20 §2, 1990; Ord. 87-6 §4, 1987).

Where the city attorney finds probable cause exists to believe and prove by a preponderance of credible evidence that the animal in question has twice bitten one or more persons without provocation or justification during the applicable period, the city attorney may commence a civil action in
the Whitman County District Court requesting the hearing provided for in Section 9.20.090.

Where it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence to the satisfaction of the court that the injured person provoked the animal into attacking, such fact shall be an absolute defense to the particular bite. The court may also consider whether or not the attack occurred on property under the control of the keeper of the animal as well as the legal status of the victim on that property in determining whether a biting incident shall be included within the twenty-four month period or may have been justified and not included.
(Ord. 14-13 §10, 2014; Ord. 00-2 §5, 2000; Ord. 87-6 §9, 1987).

(9) When required by the director, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(10) All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this Chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of the premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained for twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.
(11) No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city of Pullman and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment; provided, however, that any such special agreement or arrangement shall provide that the industrial concern shall pay for all direct and indirect costs and expenses incurred in accepting the industrial waste of unusual strength or character which are greater than the direct and indirect cost of accepting industrial waste of usual strength. "Industrial waste of unusual strength or character" may be characterized as waste from an industry and which has pollutant concentration which exceeds the range of concentration of the pollutants in normal domestic sewage.
Any agreement or arrangement is subject to restrictions imposed by state or federal permits and regulations. (Ord. 87-29 §4, 1987; Ord. 83-13 §1, 1983; Ord. 80-12 §5, 1980).

10.30.010 Legislative Findings and Policy. The City Council finds, determines and declares that the streams, rivers, ponds, waterways, groundwater, and functionally related natural and manmade stormwater control facilities constitute a stormwater control facility.
The City Council finds, determines and declares that the public stormwater control facility including its administration, which provides for the collection, treatment, storage and disposal of stormwater, provides benefits and services to all developed property within the incorporated City limits. Such benefits may include, but are not limited to: the provision of adequate systems of collection, conveyance, detention, treatment and release of stormwater; the reduction of hazards to property and life resulting from stormwater runoff; improvements in general health and welfare through reduction of undesirable stormwater conditions; and improvements to the water quality of the stormwater and its receiving waters. Ecology’s decision to include the City in the NPDES Phase II municipal stormwater general permit program now requires the City of Pullman to implement local water quality protection activities and programs to reduce and control the potential to pollute surface waters and groundwaters by storm drainage originating on both public and private properties.
The City Council finds, determines and declares that development of lands alter both the amount of stormwater runoff and the amount of pollution contained in such runoff and that the variation in these two factors constitutes a fair way to determine the burdens imposed upon the system and the benefits of the services received by the customer from the pollution management and regulatory services and facilities provided by a utility for storm drainage and surface water management, and the customer’s charges for management of such burdens and provision of such services and facilities.
The City Council finds, determines and declares that the amount of impervious surface, land use, and rainfall will determine the volume of runoff and the general level of pollution from a property, which has been well established in both engineering practice and water quality studies by the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Washington Department of Ecology, the United States Geological Survey, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and others. While the relationships established by the above studies are adequate to assign charges, the City Storm Drainage and Surface Water Management Utility may perform local studies and based upon the results of these, may adjust rates and charges in the future to more accurately reflect the burdens imposed by customer classes within the City.
The City Council finds, determines and declares that to fund the costs of storm drainage and surface water management in the City, it is appropriate to adopt service charges for stormwater users, with rates varying according to the services furnished, the burdens imposed or benefits received; and the character, use and stormwater runoff characteristics of the land. (Ord. 09-2 §2, 2009)

The ERU is the approximate average square footage of impervious surface area on a single-family residential parcel.
(2) Setting the ERU. The ERU shall be set by the City Council from time to time by ordinance. The ERU is hereby set as 3,500 square feet. This value was determined through the measurement of impervious surface on a random sampling (average) of single-family residential parcels.
(3) Source of ERU. The impervious surface area of developed property shall be determined through property tax assessor’s rolls or site examination, mapping information, aerial photographs, and other reliable information.
(4) Minimum Service Charge. Unless otherwise waived, the minimum charge for a developed property shall be based on 1.0 ERU. (Ord. 09-2 §10, 2009)
10.30.100 Property Classification for Stormwater User’s Fee. As authorized by RCW Chapters 35.67 and 35.92, the City Council finds that variations in land use and impervious surface results in differences in the burdens imposed upon the stormwater system and the costs to serve such parcels. City parcels shall be differentiated from one another based upon the stormwater burdens imposed and the costs of City stormwater services.
(1) Customer Classification. For purposes of determining the stormwater user’s fees, owners of all developed parcels in the City are classified into one of the following general classes:
(a) Residential;
(b) Duplex, Tri-plex and Four-plex; and
(c) Non-residential.
To reflect the burdens imposed upon the City stormwater system, parcels with facilities deemed to be more industrial or commercial in nature will have fees determined in the same manner as the non-residential class regardless of the land use codes assigned by the City.
(2) Residential Fee. The stormwater fee for residential parcels shall equal the base rate. The fee for commercial mobile/manufactured home parks and condominiums shall be determined using the same methodology as used for non-residential parcels.
(3) Duplex, Tri-plex, and Four-plex Fee. The stormwater fee for a duplex, tri-plex and four-plex shall equal one half the base rate multiplied by the number of dwelling units.
(4) Non-residential Fee. Owners of developed non-residential parcels shall pay a stormwater fee equal to the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the estimated total impervious surface area of the parcel by one ERU. The minimum stormwater fee for developed non-residential parcels shall equal the base rate for residential parcels. (Ord. 09-2 §11, 2009)
10.30.110 Base Rate and Appeal Fee Establishment and Review.
(1) Base Rate. The base rate for services to utility customers shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the City Council. The effective date for such rates shall be established as set forth in the appropriate resolution of the City Council.
The utility base rate schedule and fees set by resolution of the City Council shall be reviewed periodically and revised as necessary to reflect any changes in operation and capital costs and to ensure fair funding of the program.
(2) Appeal Fee. The appeal fee shall be calculated to provide adequate revenues to cover all costs associated with the review and processing of
requests for adjustment to customer charges as described in PCC 10.30.150 of this chapter. The appeal fee shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the City Council. The effective date for such fees shall be established as set forth in the appropriate resolution of the City Council.
The appeal fee set by resolution of the City Council shall be reviewed periodically and revised as necessary to ensure fair and full recovery of costs for review and processing of appeals. (Ord. 09-2 §12, 2009)
10.30.120 Adjustments to Stormwater User’s Fees. Credits allowed under this section shall not be cumulative. Credits or waivers granted by the Finance Director will become effective the billing month or cycle following the approval of the credit or waiver. Credits or waivers are not retroactive to current or prior billings and are only in effect beginning with the next billing cycle. Credits or waivers may be in effect for multiple future billing cycles provided that ongoing qualifying criteria are met. The Finance Director will take such time as necessary to process requests for credits or waivers in an orderly fashion.
(1) Credits for Properties Covered by Industrial or Municipal Stormwater Permits. The City Council recognizes that some parcel owners have been required or will be required to obtain coverage under a separate NPDES stormwater permit, which authorizes stormwater discharges associated with certain industrial or municipal activities. The City Council further recognizes that such permit holders are required to develop extensive stormwater management programs, which, when properly implemented, can reduce the discharge of pollutants into the public stormwater and surface water system and aid the City in controlling the overall effects of stormwater pollution. Parcels or portions of parcels that meet one of the criteria listed below, to the Finance Director’s satisfaction, shall receive a reduction of 20% from the annual fee charged under PCC 10.30.110 as currently enacted or hereafter amended for that portion of the parcels covered under an applicable NPDES stormwater permit.
(a) Any parcel that has an active and valid NPDES Industrial Stormwater Permit. A copy of the permit and the Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) shall be provided to the Finance Director.
(b) Any parcel that has an active and valid NPDES Municipal Stormwater Permit. A copy of the permit and current version of the Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) shall be provided to the Finance Director.
The property owner is responsible for providing all documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance with the above requirements. In the event that an applicable NPDES stormwater permit addresses only a portion of the total parcel, the credit will be applied to only that affected portion. Non-residential category property owners receiving credits shall agree to allow the City to periodically inspect/review any applicable on-site stormwater facilities and/or stormwater management activities conducted by permit holders. Failure to comply with these provisions may be cause for termination of the adjustment authorized by this section.
(2) Credit for Rainwater Harvesting Systems.
(a) Per RCW 35.67.020 (3), owners of new or remodeled residential/ commercial/ industrial/ institutional class buildings that utilize a properly constructed and maintained permissive rainwater harvesting system shall be eligible for a 10% credit applied toward that portion of their stormwater charge arising from the building upon which the system is used.
(b) Customers desiring this credit shall apply to the Finance Director and shall submit engineering design and operational information as deemed necessary by the Finance Director to make their evaluation and decision. The Finance Director will consider additional credit in excess of 10%, up to a maximum of 20%, based upon the amount of rainwater harvested. Rainwater harvesting and beneficial reuse of the runoff is found by the City Council to both reduce the burden imposed upon the system by the building by reducing runoff and to also have other beneficial water quality effects such as reduced consumption of potable water.
(3) Credits for Stormwater Best Management Practices.
(a) Owners of non-residential class properties that utilize a properly constructed and maintained stormwater best management practice designed in accordance with City of Pullman Design Standards to control flow (i.e. detention pond) shall be eligible for a 10% credit applied toward that portion of their stormwater charge arising from the impervious surface area from which the practice receives runoff.
(b) Owners of non-residential class properties that utilize a properly constructed and maintained stormwater best management practice designed in accordance with City of Pullman Design Standards to treat stormwater quality (i.e. bio-filtration) shall be eligible for a 10% credit applied toward that portion of their stormwater charge arising from the impervious surface area from which the practice receives runoff.
(c) Customers desiring this credit shall apply to the Finance Director and shall submit engineering design and operational information as deemed necessary by the Finance Director to make an evaluation and decision. Properties that employ stormwater best management practices that control flow and improve water quality are found by the City Council to reduce the burden imposed upon the system.
(4) Credits for Schools Participating in Stormwater and Surface Water Education. The City Council finds that many of the concerns about stormwater quality are created by a general lack of knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the health of the environment. The City Council also finds that Public and Private schools can provide regional benefits to the City’s Stormwater and Surface Water Management Program by carrying out certain types of educational and community activities related to protection and enhancement of surface water, groundwater, and stormwater quality. Kindergarten through grade 12 schools that are in compliance with all requirements for their own stormwater facilities, and that are carrying out surface water, groundwater, and stormwater quality educational and community activities in cooperation with the City may apply to the Finance Director for a credit, up
to a maximum of 20%, towards their stormwater fees. The amount of an approved credit shall depend upon the nature and extent of the programs and activities being performed. Schools shall pay the full charge under PCC 10.30.110 as currently enacted or hereafter amended until such time as a credit is granted by the Finance Director.
(5) Waiver of Utility Fees for Certain Property. The Finance Director shall waive stormwater and surface water utility fees for a parcel falling within the following special categories of property upon a showing that the parcel meets the following applicable criteria for so long as the criteria are met:
(a) Fees shall be waived for streets, City rights-of-way, and airport runways and taxiways provided that the City transportation system continues to be an integral component of the City stormwater control facility.
(b) Fees shall be waived for municipal parks, public trails and bike paths so long as their owners cooperate with the utility in the provisions of educational services and water quality control efforts. Parks, trails and bike paths have minimal intensity of impervious development and provide opportunities for natural resource education and development of an appreciation for water quality.
(c) Fees shall be waived for all undeveloped parcels. The City Council finds that such parcels generally have no improvements built on them, generate little to no traffic, generate less runoff, and generally are in a natural state, thereby imposing no burden upon the system and receiving no benefit from the utility’s services and facilities. Information that a property categorized as undeveloped is being used otherwise may result in a loss of this waiver. (Ord. 09-13 §2, 2009)
10.30.130 Property Owners to Pay Fees. The owner of each non-waived parcel within the boundaries of the City, as they now exist or as they may be hereafter amended, shall pay the stormwater user’s fee and charges as provided in this chapter. Property owners seeking credits or waivers shall pay the full fee until such time that the credit or waiver is granted by the Finance Director, after
which reduced fees will be applied. (Ord. 09-2 §14, 2009)
10.30.140 Billing Procedures and Penalties for Late or Non-Payment. The fees and charges as herein provided for shall be computed and billed on a monthly basis, except that, with concurrence of the City, said fees and charges for parcel owners required to obtain coverage under a separate NPDES Municipal Stormwater Permit, may be computed and billed on an annual basis with said fees and charges due on July 1 of each year. All parcels which are currently served by any City utility services and are within the City shall be assessed their monthly fees and charges each month through their utility account. Parcels not being served by any City utility service (i.e. no water meter) will have new accounts created for stormwater service as needed. If one piece of property is served by more than one account, only one account will be charged stormwater rates for each piece of property, on a case-by-case basis. Any piece of property or parcel in use for any commercial, business, or other purpose with space that meets the definition of impervious surface shall be charged stormwater rates, regardless of use of other City utility services. The charges shall be due on or before the date of billing and shall become delinquent thereafter if not paid by the thirtieth day following the date of billing.
Collection of delinquencies, interest, penalty, and costs of collection for delinquent utility service charges provided for herein shall be charged interest on the delinquent balance at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, computed on a monthly basis. The Finance Director may excuse delinquencies of less than thirty (30) days.
For parcels without City water service, if payment has not been made before delinquency, as set forth above in this Section, the City may submit the delinquent amount to a collection agency per the City’s standard collection procedures as determined by the Finance Director and at the Finance Director’s discretion.
For parcels with City water service, if payment has not been made before delinquency, as set forth above in this Section, the city shall take the following steps to notify the user and if necessary terminate stormwater service by shutting off water service to any delinquent user:
(1) On or about the tenth day following the date of delinquency, the finance department shall give notice reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise the user that:
(a) the user is delinquent in payments;
(b) water service will be shut off if the user is still delinquent in payment of stormwater charges thirty days after the date of delinquency;
(c) the user has the right to protest the billing and appeal the amount due to the Finance Director;
(d) if the user does not request a hearing with the Finance Director, or his/her designee, within thirty days following the date of delinquency and does not pay the delinquent amount or amounts due in full within this same period or any extensions thereof resulting pursuant to the provisions of 10.30.140(3), the stormwater service will be terminated by shutting off water service to that user.
(2) If the user requests a hearing on the amount due, a hearing must be held, and the user given an opportunity to be heard. The Finance Director must thereafter determine the amount due and owing and inform the user.
(3) The user shall be given ten (10) days to pay the amount determined by the Finance Director to be owing. If the amount owing has not been paid within ten days, stormwater service may be shut off by shutting off water service.
(4) Water service shall be restored if full payment of all amounts owing plus a turn-on charge as authorized in the City Water Utility Code, Section 10A.35.040(1) is made.
(5) If water service is to be cut off from a known rental unit where the tenant is not the person or entity responsible for paying for stormwater use or stormwater charges as shown on the records of the city finance department then, prior to termination of service for nonpayment and after the city has satisfied the procedures of this Section 10.30.140, the city shall place upon the premises at least five days prior to the scheduled cutoff of service such notice as is reasonably calculated to inform the tenant or tenants of the proposed cutoff of service.
(6) The city of Pullman or any of its officers or employees shall not be liable for any damages that may occur because of water service being cut off pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter.
(7) "Notice reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise the user," as used in Pullman City Code Section 10.30.140(1), includes at the minimum, written notice to the user and the owner, if the owner is not the user, and the owner has so informed the city finance department. In addition, the city shall place upon the premises at least five days prior to the scheduled cutoff of service, notice which informs the user of the proposed cutoff of service, and the opportunity to protest the proposed cutoff in a meaningful manner.
(8) If termination of water service proves ineffective at securing the delinquent amount, then the City may pursue collection procedures in a manner consistent with delinquent parcels with no water service. (Ord. 09-2 §15, 2009)
10.30.150 Appeals of ERU Determination. If an owner of a non-residential parcel subject to this chapter, or other responsible party, believes the ERU applied to their property is incorrect or otherwise disagrees with the utility rate determination, the owner may appeal the correctness of the ERU to the Finance Director, or his/her designee, within thirty (30) calendar days of the initial mailing of the billing for the fee. Such appeals shall be in writing and shall specify the grounds of the appeal and the requested remedy and shall include a non-refundable appeal fee. The Public Works Director, or his/her designee, shall work with the Finance Director to resolve appeals. Upon resolution of the appeal, an appropriate adjustment to the ERU will be made accordingly. Decisions of the Finance Director regarding such appeals shall be final. (Ord. 09-2 §16, 2009)
10.30.160 Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is declared invalid or unconstitutional for any reason, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. (Ord. 09-2 §17, 2009)

(1) Notice of Project Commencement: The applicant must notify the City before the commencement of permitted land disturbing activities. In addition, the applicant must call for inspection by the City in advance of critical junctures of construction prior to covering of underground facilities.
(2) Construction Inspections by City: The City will conduct periodic inspections of the temporary and permanent stormwater BMPs shown on the approved SWPPP or ESC Plan. The Administrator and/or designee is authorized to enter the project site at reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by this Chapter, provided that
if such project site is occupied that credentials be presented to the applicant and entry requested. If such project site is unoccupied, the Administrator and/or designee shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the applicant or other person having charge or control of the project site and request entry. The City inspector will document any variations or discrepancies from the approved plans, and document the corrective actions required to resolve such instances. An approved final inspection by the City is required before any performance bond or guarantee, or portion thereof, shall be released. Special inspections or certifications may be required.
All City inspectors shall be CESCL certified prior to conducting any inspections or submitting any inspection documentation, and be qualified to perform specific technical inspections as determined by the Administrator.
(3) Final As-Built Submittal: If the project included construction of conveyance systems, treatment facilities, flow control facilities, or structural source control BMPs, the applicant may be required at the City’s discretion to submit as-built plans (Record Drawings) to the City. These shall be engineering drawings that accurately represent the project as constructed. These corrected drawings must be legibly drafted revisions that are stamped, signed, and dated by a licensed engineer registered in the state of Washington.

(a) Construction and stabilization of all stormwater drainage facilities shall be completed prior to the issuance of a stormwater certificate of completion.
(b) Acceptance of a completion performance surety, in lieu of completed improvements, shall be permitted only when completion of improvements prior to issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy is impractical (i.e., due to construction season delays or other factors beyond the proponent’s control). If use of a completion performance surety is desired, the applicant shall submit a written request indicating such to the City. The performance surety shall be an amount equal to 200 percent of the value of the stormwater improvements to be completed (including final site stabilization), as approved by the Administrator.
The following types of sureties will be accepted:
(i) Cash;
(ii) Two-party Certificate of Deposit;
(iii) Bond;

(e) If the applicant, his or her agent, or contractor fails to comply with the Administrator’s requirements as set forth in Sections 10.32.120(1)(d) and 10.32.120(1)(f), then the Administrator may cause the work to be done and the cost thereof shall be paid from the performance surety required of the applicant under this Section; provided, however, that if the cost for such work exceeds the amount of the performance surety, the excess amount shall be billed to the applicant and/or the property owner. The portion of any performance surety remaining after all claims against it have been paid and the project has been approved as complete by the Administrator and/or his designee shall be forfeited to the City and deposited in the Stormwater Fund to compensate for administrative expenses related to applicant’s failure to perform.
(f) For any performance surety held by the City of
Pullman on or after the effective date of this Chapter, if the applicant, his or her agent, or contractor suspends or abandons the work for a period of 360 days after the last documented inspection, the performance surety shall be forfeited and deposited in the Stormwater Fund. Forfeiture of the performance surety shall not relieve the applicant of any requirements, duty, or obligation to complete the work authorized by the stormwater permit or the requirements of this Chapter.
(g) Stormwater Certificate of Completion: Subsequent to final installation and stabilization of all stormwater BMPs shown on the City approved plans, submission of all necessary as-built plans, and final inspection and approval by the City, the City shall issue a Stormwater Certificate of Completion for the project. In issuing such a certificate, the City shall determine that all work has been satisfactorily completed in substantial conformance with this Chapter.

10A.05.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Title is
(1) to provide for the regulation of the City of Pullman water system, including the construction of new facilities, in order to provide for a uniform and integrated water system, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to carry out the water system plan of the City.
(2) to establish the authority for the acquisition, design, construction, maintenance, management, and operation of the City's water system. (Ord. 88-23 §1, 1988).
10A.05.020 Definitions. Words used in this Title shall have their normal and customary meaning, unless specifically defined otherwise. The following words and terms used in this Title shall have the following meanings unless when used the context thereof clearly indicates to the contrary.
* For Statutes relating to utilities, see RCW Chapter 35A.80.
(1) "Air-Gap Separation" means a physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An "approved air-gap separation" shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above
the overflow rim of the vessel which in no case shall be less than one inch.
(2) "Approved" when used in reference to a water supply, an air-gap separation, a double check valve assembly, a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, or other backflow prevention assemblies or methods means one that has the approval of the Department of Health.
(3) "Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker" (also known as the "non-pressure type vacuum breaker") means an assembly containing a float-check, a check seat and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float falls and forms a check valve against backsiphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the assembly. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e. contaminant) under a backsiphonage condition only.
(4) "Backflow" means the undesirable reversal of the flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gases, or other substances into the distribution pipes of the water system from any source or sources.
(5) Backflow Prevention Assembly - Approved: "approved backflow prevention assembly" means an assembly that has been investigated and approved by the Department of Health. The type of assembly used should be based on the degree of hazard either existing or potential. The types are:
(a) Double Check Valve Assembly
(b) Double Check-Detector Check Valve Assembly
(c) Pressure Vacuum Breaker
(d) Reduced Pressure Principle Assembly
(e) Reduced Pressure Principle-Detector Assembly
(f) Atmospheric (non-pressure) Vacuum Breaker

10A.40.100 Construction.
10A.40.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to protect the health of the user and the potability of the water in the water system, by requiring the inspection and regulation of all actual or potential cross connections between potable and non-potable water systems in order to minimize the danger of contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Controlling and preventing cross connection is accomplished by either installing an approved backflow prevention assembly or removing the cross connection. (Ord. No. 92-18 §1, 1992).
10A.40.020 Responsibility. The director shall be responsible for the protection of the water system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. (Ord. No. 92-18 §2, 1992).
10A.40.030 Backflow prevention assembly--when required, types, approved types.
(1) When required. An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each water service connection to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served before or in front of the first branch line leaving the service line whenever any of the following situations exist.
(a) When a premises has an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source of water by the director, then the city's water system shall be protected against backflow from that premises by installing an
approved backflow prevention assembly in the water service connection which is appropriate to counter the degree of hazard.
(b) If a premises is one on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in a way that creates an actual or potential hazard to the city's water system, then the public water system shall be protected against backflow from that premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the water service connection which is appropriate to counter the degree of hazard. The term objectionable substances as used herein includes, but is not limited to, process waters and waters originating from the city's water system which have been subjected to a deterioration in quality.
(c) On premises
(i) having an internal cross connection that cannot be permanently corrected or controlled, or
(ii) having an intricate plumbing and piping arrangement, or
(iii) where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspections purposes thus making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist,
the city's water system shall be protected against backflow from that premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the water service connection which is appropriate to counter the degree of hazard.
(2) Types. The type of backflow prevention assembly required under subsection (1) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists to the potability of water in the city's water system.
(a) On any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as set forth in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the city's water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation, an approved
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, or an approved reduced pressure principle-detector assembly.
(b) On any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the city's water system, the city's water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly, or an approved double check-detector check valve assembly.
(c) On any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a way that creates an actual or potential hazard to the city's water system, the city's water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation, an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, or an approved reduced pressure principle-detector assembly. Examples of premises where these conditions exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants.
(d) On any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either actual or potential, the city's water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation, an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, or an approved reduced pressure principle-detector assembly at the water service connection.
(e) On any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the city's water system shall be protected against backflow from that premises by either an approved air-gap separation, an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly, or an approved reduced pressure principle-detector assembly on each water service connection to the premises.
(3) Approved types. Any backflow prevention assembly required by this section shall be a model and size approved by the director. The term "Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly" shall mean an assembly that has been
approved by the Department of Health. (Ord. No. 92-18 §3, 1992).
10A.40.040 Backflow prevention assemblies--existing. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of Section 10A.40.030 but were approved devices for the purposes described therein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under Section 10A.40.060, be excluded from the requirements of this Chapter so long as the director is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the city's water system. Whenever the existing backflow prevention assembly is moved from its present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the director finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of Section 10A.40.030. (Ord. No. 92-18 §4, 1992).
10A.40.050 Backflow prevention assemblies--installation. Times. If, in the judgement of the director, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the customer's water service connection; or, within the customer's water system) for the safety of the city's water system, the director shall give notice in writing to that customer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on the customer's premises. New customers shall install an approved device(s) at the time of building permit issuance or within 90 calendar days after notification to do so. Existing customers shall install approved device(s) within 180 calendar days after notification to do so. (Ord. No. 92-18 §5, 1992).
10A.40.060 Inspections--Cross connections, backflow prevention assemblies--testing, delegation.
(1) Cross Connections. Each customer's water system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times by authorized representatives of the city to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of the provisions of this Chapter exist. When such a condition becomes known to the director, the director shall deny or immediately discontinue service to that premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state statutes and city ordinances relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
(2) Backflow prevention assemblies--testing. It shall be the duty of the customer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made upon installation and at least once per year. In those instances where the director deems the hazard to be great enough the director may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water customer and shall be performed by a certified backflow assembly tester approved by the director. The customer shall notify the director in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that a representative of the city may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be submitted to the director within 30 calendar days after the customer receives notification of the yearly test results.
(3) Delegation. The director may delegate inspection duties to a certified cross-connection control specialist. (Ord. No. 92-18 §6, 1992).
10A.40.070 Disconnection of water service.
(1) Failure, refusal, or inability on the part of a customer to install, have tested, and maintain backflow prevention assemblies shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to that premises until the requirements of this Chapter have been satisfactorily met.
(2) No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the city unless the water system is protected as required by state laws and regulations, and this Chapter. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the city if a backflow prevention assembly required by this Chapter is not installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. (Ord. No. 92-18 §7, 1992).
10A.40.080 WAC Rules and Regulations. Actions of the director governing cross-connection prevention, control, and abatement shall conform to the rules and regulations set forth in the Washington Administrative Code 246-290-490 as now existing and
in accordance with any amendments that may hereafter be made thereto. (Ord. No. 92-18 §8, 1992).

15.04.075 Exceptions to prohibition of discrimination.

(5) Housing for older persons is exempt from the prohibition against familial status discrimination in accordance with the rules and regulations issued by the United States

(2) The Planning Director or his designee shall investigate and review each statement of complaint to determine whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that an unfair housing practice has been committed.
(3) If the Planning Director determines that such reasonable grounds exist, it shall issue its complaint against the person who is alleged to have committed the unfair housing practice. Such complaint need not be limited to matters contained in the aggrieved person's statement of complaint, but such complaint issued by the Planning Director shall be limited to matters which are pertinent to offenses under this Chapter. Such complaint shall state the name of the respondent, his or her address, and the name of the person aggrieved, the address of the housing accommodation concerning which the alleged unfair housing practice has been committed, a statement that the Planning Director has reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent has committed an unfair housing practice, and a brief statement of the facts upon which the Planning Director bases such a belief.

housing practice which is the subject of a statement of complaint filed with the City.
The Planning Director is specifically authorized and encouraged to engage in informal discussions with respondent, or his or her representative, for the purpose of reaching an agreement to the effect that any violations of this Chapter will not be continued or repeated. Upon arriving at such an agreement satisfactory to the Planning Director, such proceedings shall be terminated; however, the Planning Director shall attempt to arrange a means of follow-up to determine that the terms of such agreement are being followed.
(6) In the event that the Planning Director is unable to eliminate the unfair practice which is the subject of a statement of complaint filed with the commission, by the means provided in subsection (8) of this section, and upon entry of findings to that effect, the complainant will be advised to contact the Washington State Human Rights Commission for further assistance.

(Ord. 07-22 §4, 2007; Ord. B-85 §13, 1973).
15.04.170 Severability. If any section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or void, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Chapter. (Ord. B-85 §18, 1973).

This Chapter contains this City's SEPA procedures and policies. The SEPA rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC, must be used in conjunction with this Chapter. (Ord. 84-25 §1, 1984).
II. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
16.39.020 Purpose--Adoption by reference. This part contains the basic requirements that apply to the SEPA process. The City adopts the following sections of Chapter 197-11 of the WAC by reference, and as the same may be hereafter amended:
WAC 197-11-040 Definitions.
050 Lead Agency.
055 Timing of the SEPA process.
060 Content of the environmental review. (the optional provision of WAC 197-11-060(3)(c) is adopted, provided analysis of more than one independent private proposal shall occur in a single environmental document only if all affected private applicants agree to such an analysis.)
070 Limitations of actions during SEPA process.
080 Incomplete or unavailable information.
090 Supporting documents.
100 Information required of applicants.
(Ord. 84-25 §2, 1984).
16.39.030 Additional definitions. In addition to those definitions contained within WAC 197-11-700 through 197-11-799,
when used in this Chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context indicates otherwise:
(1) "Department" means any division, subdivision, or organizational unit of the City established by ordinance, rule, or order.
(2) "SEPA rules" means Chapter 197-11 WAC adopted by the Department of Ecology.
(3) "Ordinance" means an ordinance, resolution, or other procedure used by the City to adopt regulatory requirements.
(4) "Early notice" means the City's response to an applicant stating whether it considers issuance of a determination of significance likely for the applicant's proposal (mitigated determination of nonsignificance (DNS) procedures). (Ord. 84-25 §3, 1984).
16.39.040 Designation of responsible official.
(1) For those proposals for which the City is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the Director of Public Works or his/her designee.
(2) For all proposals for which the City is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the "lead agency" or "responsible official" by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in Section 16.39.020.
(3) In performing the above duties, the responsible official may consider the recommendations of the following persons or their designees: City Planner, Assistant City Engineer, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Director of Public Services, and such other persons as the responsible official may desire to consult. (Ord. 84-25 §4, 1984).
16.39.050 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.
(1) The department within the City receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940; unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.
(2) When the City is the lead agency for a proposal, the responsible official shall comply with the provisions of subsection 16.39.040(2) of this Chapter.
(3) When the City is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the City shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the City may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.
(4) If the City or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within fifteen days of receipt of the determination, or the City must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the fifteen-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the City may be initiated by the Director of Public Works or his/her designee.
(5) Departments of the City are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.
(6) Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal (That is: Which agencies require nonexempt licenses?). (Ord. 84-25 §5, 1984).
16.39.053 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency. For any proposal for a private project where the City would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the City's responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the City shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the City's respon-sible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appro-
priate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the City shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 84-25 §6, 1984).
16.39.058 Additional timing considerations.
(1) For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or FEIS for the proposal shall accompany the City's staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the Planning Commission or similar advisory bodies; provided, however, that if because of timing constraints contained in specific statutes or ordinances it would not be possible to complete an FEIS then a DEIS may accompany the City's staff recommendation.
(2) If the City's only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the City conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. If such a request is made, site plans prepared in accordance with the provisions of the zoning code of the City of Pullman shall accompany the environmental checklist for nonexempt construction. (Ord. 84-25 §7, 1984).
III. CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS AND THRESHOLD DETERMINATIONS
16.39.065 Purpose of this part and adoption by reference.
This part contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a "probable significant, adverse environmental impact" requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This part also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The City adopts the following sections of Chapter 197 of the WAC by reference and as the same may be hereafter amended, as supplemented in this part:

16.39.070 Flexible thresholds for categorical exemptions.
(1) The City establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(b) based on local conditions:
(a) For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800 (1) (b) (i): Up to twenty dwelling units.
(b) For agriculture structures in WAC 197-11-800 (1) (b) (ii): Up to thirty thousand square feet.

(d) For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800 (1) (b) (iv): Up to forty parking spaces.
(e) For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800 (1) (b) (v): Up to five hundred cubic yards.
(2) Whenever the City establishes new exempt levels under this section, it shall send them to the Department of Ecology, Headquarters Office, Olympia, Washington, 98504 under WAC 197-11-800 (1)(c). (Ord. 84-25 §9, 1984).
16.39.080 Use of exemptions.
(1) For each department within the City that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, for the department initiating the proposal, the responsible official shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The responsible official's determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this Chapter apply to the proposal. The City shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.
(2) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible official shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the responsible official shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the responsible official's consideration is exempt.
(3)
(a) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the responsible official may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this Chapter.
(b) The responsible official may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and
(c) The responsible official may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if non-exempt action(s) were not approved. (Ord. 84-25 §10, 1984).
16.39.090 Environmental Checklist.
(1) A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or the approval not specifically exempted in this Chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the responsible official and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The City shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the City is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.
(2) For private proposals, the City will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist providing assistance as necessary. For City proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.
(3) The City may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:
(a) The City has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or
(b) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 84-25 §11, 1984).
16.39.100 Mitigated DNS.
(1) As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.
(2) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:
(a) follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and
(b) precede the responsible official's actual threshold determination for the proposal.
(3) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within fifteen calendar days. The response shall:
(a) be written;
(b) state whether the responsible official currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the responsible official to consider a DS; and
(c) state that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.
(4) As much as possible, the responsible official should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.
(2) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the responsible official shall base his/her threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within fifteen
calendar days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:
(3)
(a) If the responsible official indicated specific mitigation measures in his/her response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the responsible official shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).
(b) If the responsible official indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.
(b) The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes, or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are inadequate, whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or "contract 200-foot stormwater retention pond to Y location" are adequate.
(d) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies, or other documents.
(6) Mitigated DNS's issued under WAC 197-11-340(2) require a fifteen-day comment period and public notice.
(7) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the City.
(8) If the responsible official's tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the responsible official should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).
(9) The City's written response under subsection (2) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a
written request for early notice, shall not bind the City to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 84-25 §12, 1984).

applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also
notify the applicant of the City's procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.
(3) The City may require an applicant to provide information the City does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not required to supply information that is not required under this Chapter or that is being requested from another agency. This does not apply to information the City may request under another ordinance or statute. (Ord. 84-25 §14, 1984).

16.50.010 Purpose.
(1) The purpose of this Chapter is to designate and classify ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas and to protect these areas and their functions and values, while also allowing for reasonable use of private property.
(2) This Chapter is established to implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the city of Pullman Comprehensive Plan and the Growth Management Act.
(3) The city finds that critical areas provide a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents, and/or may pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property. The beneficial functions and values provided by critical areas include, but are not limited to, water quality protection and enhancement; fish and wildlife habitat; food chain support; flood storage; conveyance and attenuation; ground water recharge and discharge; erosion control; wave attenuation; protection from
hazards; historical, archaeological, and aesthetic value protection; and recreation. These beneficial functions are not listed in order of priority.
(4) By identifying development impacts to critical areas, this Chapter seeks to:
(a) protect members of the public, public resources, and facilities from injury, loss of life, or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures, erosion, seismic events, volcanic eruptions, or flooding;
(b) protect unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, and fish and wildlife and their habitats;
(c) direct activities not dependent on critical area resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas; and,
(d) prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat, and the overall net loss of wetlands, frequently flooded areas and habitat conservation areas.
(5) This Chapter is intended to protect critical areas in accordance with the Growth Management Act and through the application of best available science, as determined according to WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925, and in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals.
(6) This Chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this Chapter to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of property.
(7) The city’s enactment or enforcement of this Chapter shall not be construed for the benefit of any individual person or group of persons other than the general public. (Ord. 03-18, §2, 2003).
16.50.020 Authority and Applicability.
(1) The planning director is given the authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this Chapter to accomplish the stated purpose.
(2) The city shall not approve any development permit or subdivision, or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation, or to construct or alter any structure or improvement in, over, or on a critical area of associated buffer, without first assuring compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
(3) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all lands, all land uses and development activity, and all structures and facilities in the city, whether or not a development permit or other authorization is required and shall apply to every person, firm, partnership, corporation, group, governmental agency, or other entity that owns, leases, or administers land within the city. No person, company, agency, or applicant shall alter a critical area or buffer except as consistent with the purposes and requirements of this Chapter.
(4) Approval of a development permit pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this Chapter. (Ord. 03-18, §3, 2003).
16.50.030 Relationship to Other Regulations.
(1) These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay to the city’s zoning code (Title 17) and other applicable regulations adopted by the city, including but not limited to design standards, building code, shorelines management program, and State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) procedures.
(2) These critical area regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under SEPA, as locally adopted.
(3) Any individual critical area adjoined by another type of critical area shall meet the requirements that provide the most protection to the critical areas involved. When any provision of this Chapter or any existing regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflicts with this Chapter, that which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply.
(4) Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, Shoreline Substantial Development
Permits, HPA permits, Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this Chapter. Where applicable the planning director will encourage use of information such as permit applications to other agencies or special studies prepared in response to other regulatory requirements to support required documentation submitted for critical areas review. (Ord. 03-18, §4, 2003).
16.50.040 Appeals . Any aggrieved party may appeal final decisions of the planning director regarding critical area reports required under Sections 16.50.140, 16.50.150, 16.50.260, and 16.50.450. An appeal of such decisions shall be heard by the city hearing examiner in accordance with the procedures set forth in Pullman City Code Section 16.39.170. (Ord. 07-27 §1, 2007; Ord. 03-18 §5, 2003).
16.50.050 Interpretation. The planning director may, acting on his or her own initiative or in response to an inquiry, issue interpretations of any provision of this Chapter. The planning director shall base his or her interpretations on the defined or common meaning of the words of the provision and the general purpose of the provision. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, the provisions of this Chapter shall be considered to be the minimum requirements necessary, shall be liberally construed to serve the purpose of this ordinance, and shall be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other provisions under state statute. (Ord. 07-27 §2, 2007; Ord. 03-18, §6, 2003).
16.50.060 Severability. If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this Chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such order or judgment shall be confined in its operation to the controversy in which it was rendered. The decision shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any part thereof and to this end the provisions of each clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or party of this law are hereby declared to be severable. (Ord. 03-18, §7, 2003).
16.50.070 Definitions. Words not defined in this Chapter shall be as defined in the following codes under this order of precedence: the Pullman City Code, the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC). Words not found in any of these codes shall be as defined in the Webster's Third New International Dictionary, latest edition.
(1) Adaptive Management. Adaptive management relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and non-regulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining
information in the face of uncertainty.
(2) Adjacent. To be nearby and not necessarily abutting.
(3) Advance Mitigation. Mitigation of an anticipated critical area impact or hazard completed according to an approved critical area report or other applicable information and prior to site development.
(4) Agricultural Land. Land primarily devoted to the commercial production of horticultural, viticultural, floricultural, dairy, apiary, vegetable, or animal products or of berries, grain, hay, straw, turf, seed, Christmas trees not subject to the excise tax imposed by RCW 84.33.100 through 84.33.140, finfish in upland hatcheries, or livestock, and that has long-term commercial significance for agricultural production. [RCW 36.70A.030; WAC 365-190-030].
(5) Alkali Wetlands. Wetlands characterized by the occurrence of shallow saline water. In eastern Washington these wetlands contain surface water with specific conductance that exceeds 3,000 micromhos/cm. The salt concentrations in these wetlands have resulted from a relatively long-term process of groundwater surfacing and evaporating.

(Ord. 19-6 §1, 2019; 03-18 §8, 2003)
16.50.080 Jurisdiction—Critical Areas.
(1) The city shall regulate all uses within 200 feet of, or that are likely to affect, one or more critical areas, consistent with the best available science and the provisions contained within this Chapter.
(2) Critical areas regulated by this Chapter include:
(a) wetlands;
(b) critical aquifer recharge areas;
(c) frequently flooded areas;
(d) geologically hazardous areas; and
(e) fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.
(3) All areas within the city meeting the definition of one or more critical areas, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 03-18, §9, 2003).
16.50.090 Protection of Critical Areas. Any action taken pursuant to this Chapter shall result in equivalent or greater functions and values of the critical areas associated with the proposed action, as determined by the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available. All actions and developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the mitigation sequencing requirements in Section 16.50.170 to avoid, minimize and restore all adverse impacts. Applicants must first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before restoration and compensation of impacts will be allowed. No activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or values of critical areas.
(Ord. 19-6 §2, 2019; 03-18 §10, 2003)
16.50.100 Best Available Science.
(1) Best Available Science Must Be Consistent with Criteria. The best available science is the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available that is applicable to the critical area prepared by local, state, or federal natural resource agencies and/or a qualified scientific professional or team of qualified scientific professionals, and that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-195-900 through WAC 365-195-925. In the context of critical
areas protection, best available science must also be based upon a valid scientific process as defined in WAC 365-195-905. Best available science sources are available in records maintained by the department.
(2) Absence of Valid Scientific Information. Where there is an absence of valid scientific information or incomplete scientific information relating to a critical area, leading to uncertainty about the specific boundary of a critical area, and risk to critical area function of permitting an alteration of or impact to the critical area, the planning director shall:
(a) Take a “precautionary or a no-risk approach,” that strictly limits development and land use activities until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved;
(b) Require an effective adaptive management program that relies on scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and non-regulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty. An adaptive management program shall:
(i) address funding for the research component of the adaptive management program;
(ii) change course based on the results and interpretation of new information that resolves uncertainties;
(iii)commit to the appropriate time frame and scale necessary to reliably evaluate regulatory and non-regulatory actions affecting protection of critical areas; and
(c) Maintain a critical areas designation certification program for wetlands and habitat conservation areas by periodically updating the city critical area maps with new information as it is provided to the city. Currently the city has two types of boundaries depicted on the wetlands and habitat conservation area maps:
(i) Certified. Where the critical area boundary has been verified and mapped by a qualified professional (e.g. delineated wetland) and this information has been provided to the city.
(ii) Uncertified. Where more specific information
needs to prepared by a qualified professional and provided to the city to accurately show the boundary of a given critical area.
The most recent city critical area map revision identifying certified and uncertified wetlands and habitat conservation areas becomes the map of record for demonstrating compliance with the state requirement for designating and classifying these critical areas. (Ord. 19-6 §3, 2019; 03-18 §11, 2003)).
16.50.110 Allowed Activities.
(1) Process. The planning director shall allow activities that are verified to comply with this Chapter. Documentation of allowed activities shall be maintained on file at the department.
(2) Allowed Activities Shall Avoid Impacts to Critical Areas. All allowed activities shall use reasonable methods to avoid potential impacts to critical areas, using best management practices that result in the least amount of impact to the critical areas where practicable. Designation as an allowed activity does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Best management practices shall be used for tree and vegetation protection, construction management, erosion and sedimentation control, water quality protection, and regulation of chemical applications. The city shall observe the use of best management practices to ensure that the activity does not result in degradation to the critical area. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense.
(3) Allowed Activities. The activities identified in this Subsection shall be allowed in critical areas and their buffers without a critical area report, provided they are otherwise consistent with applicable local, state, and federal laws. If a proposed or unauthorized activity does not meet the qualifications specified for that activity in this Subsection, it shall be addressed through the general review procedures set forth in Section 16.50.130 or the enforcement provisions set forth in Section 16.50.220, as applicable. Allowed activities are as follows:
(a) Emergencies. Emergency activities are those activities necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or those that
pose an immediate risk of damage to private property and that require remedial or preventative action in a time frame too short to allow for compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. Emergency actions that create an impact to a critical area or its buffer shall use reasonable methods to address the emergency; in addition, they must have the least possible impact to the critical area or its buffer. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the planning director within one working day following commencement of the emergency activity. Within 30 days, the planning director shall determine if the action taken was within the scope of the emergency actions allowed in this Paragraph. If the planning director determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then enforcement provisions of Section 16.50.220 shall apply. After the emergency, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully restore and/or mitigate any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the emergency action in accordance with the critical area report and mitigation plan. The person or agency undertaking the action shall apply for review, and the critical area report and mitigation plan shall be reviewed by the planning director in accordance with the review procedures contained herein. Restoration and/or mitigation activities must be initiated within one year of the date of the emergency, and completed in a timely manner;
(b) Operation, Maintenance or Repair. Operation, normal and routine maintenance or repair of existing structures, infrastructure improvements, utilities, public or private roads, dikes, levees or drainage systems that do not require a development permit, if the activity does not further alter or increase the impact to, or encroach further within, the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed operation, maintenance, or repair;
(c) Passive Outdoor Activities. Recreation, education, and scientific research activities that do not degrade the critical area, including fishing, hiking, and bird watching;
(d) Permit Requests Subsequent to Previous Critical Area Review. Development permits that involve both
discretionary land use approvals (such as subdivisions, rezones, or conditional use permits), and construction approvals (such as building permits) if all of the following conditions have been met:
(i) the provisions of this Chapter have been previously addressed as part of another approval;
(ii) there have been no material changes in the potential impact to the critical area or buffer since the prior review;
(iii) there is no new information available that is applicable to any critical area review of the site or particular critical area;
(iv) the permit or approval has not expired or, if no expiration date, no more than five years has elapsed since the issuance of that permit or approval; and
(v) compliance with any standards or conditions placed upon the prior permit or approval has been achieved or secured;
(e) Modification to Existing Structures. Structural modification of, addition to, or replacement of an existing legally constructed structure that does not further alter or increase the impact to the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed modification or replacement, provided that restoration of structures substantially damaged by fire, flood, or act of nature must be initiated within one year of the date of such damage, as evidenced by the issuance of a valid building permit, and diligently pursued to completion;
(f) Activities Within the Improved Right-of-Way. Replacement, modification, installation, or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment, or appurtenances, not including substations, when such facilities are located within the improved portion of the public right-of-way or a city authorized private roadway, except those activities that alter a wetland or watercourse (such as culverts or bridges) or result in the transport of sediment or increased stormwater;
(g) Planting of Vegetation. Planting of vegetation within a critical area or its buffer, provided a landscaping plan for this activity has been approved by the city;
(h) Conservation Activities. Conservation, restoration, or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing critical area;
(i) Pedestrian/Bicycle Trails. Pedestrian/bicycle trails that are located in buffer areas but not within wetlands or habitat conservation areas, where the trail surface meets all other requirements including water quality standards set forth in the city’s Design Standards;
(j) Select Vegetation Removal Activities. Select vegetation removal activities are allowed. Accepted vegetation removal activities include: a) removing and controlling invasive or noxious weeds; b) harvesting wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, or alteration of the critical area by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources; c) removing trees that are hazardous, posing a threat to public safety, or posing an imminent risk of damage to private property; or c) removing vegetation to control a fire or halt the spread of disease or damaging insects consistent with the State Forest Practices Act (Chapter 76.09 RCW). Unless otherwise provided or as a necessary part of an approved alteration, removal of any vegetation or woody debris from a habitat conservation area or wetland shall be prohibited;
(k) Chemical Applications. The application of herbicides, pesticides, organic or mineral-derived fertilizers, or other hazardous substances, if necessary, provided that their use shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal law;
(l) Minor Site Investigative Work. Work necessary for land use submittals, such as surveys, soil logs, percolation tests, and other related activities, where such activities do not require construction of new roads or significant amounts of excavation. In every case, impacts to the critical area shall
be minimized and disturbed areas shall be immediately restored; and
(m) Boundary Markers. Installation or modification of boundary markers.
(Ord. 19-6 §4, 2019; 03-18, §12, 2003).
16.50.120 Exception—Reasonable Use.
(1) If the application of this Chapter would deny all reasonable use of the subject property, the property owner may apply for an exception pursuant to this Section.
(2) An application for a reasonable use exception shall be made to the planning director and shall include a critical area report, including a mitigation plan, if necessary; and any other related project documents, such as permit applications to other agencies, special studies, and environmental documents prepared pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW). The planning director shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the exception request based on review of the submitted information; a site inspection; the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available; and the proposal’s ability to comply with the following reasonable use exception criteria:
(a) the application of this Chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property;
(b) no other reasonable use of the property has less impact on the critical area;
(c) any alteration is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property;
(d) the inability of the applicant to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant after the effective date of this Chapter, or the city’s 1992 Critical Areas Ordinance;
(e) the proposal meets the requirements set forth in this Chapter; and
(f) the use does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.
(3) The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to bring
forth evidence in support of the application and to provide sufficient information on which any decision has to be made on the application.
(Ord. 19-6 §5, 2019; 03-18, §13, 2003).
16.50.130 General Review Process for Activities Affecting Critical Areas. The city shall follow the process discussed below and as outlined in Figure 16.50.1.
(1) Initial Review. The planning director shall take the following actions during the initial review of a project application:

A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project.
(5) Contingency Plan. The mitigation plan shall include identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates project performance standards are not being met.
(6) Financial Guarantees. The mitigation plan shall include financial guarantees, if necessary, to ensure that the mitigation plan is fully implemented. Financial guarantees ensuring fulfillment of the compensation project, monitoring program, and any contingency measures shall be posted in accordance with Section 16.50.230.
(Ord. 19-6 §10, 2019; 03-18, §19, 2003).
16.50.190 Innovative Mitigation.
(1) The city may encourage and facilitate innovative mitigation projects. Advance mitigation or mitigation banking are examples of alternative mitigation projects allowed under the provisions of this Section where one or more applicants, or an organization with demonstrated capability, may undertake a mitigation project together
if it is demonstrated that all of the following circumstances exist:
(a) creation or enhancement of a larger system of critical areas and open space is preferable to the preservation of many individual habitat areas;
(b) the group demonstrates the organizational and fiscal capability to act cooperatively; (c) the group demonstrates that long-term management of the habitat area will be provided; and
(d) there is a clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the identified mitigation site.
(2) Conducting mitigation as part of a cooperative process does not reduce or eliminate the required replacement ratios.
(3) Innovative mitigation projects as described in this Section may, at the discretion of the planning director, be exempted from the timing requirements set forth in Subsection 16.50.160(3).
(Ord. 19-6 §11, 2019; 03-18, §20, 2003).
16.50.200 Critical Area Markers and Signs. The critical area or buffer shall be identified with temporary signs prior to any site alteration. Such temporary signs may be replaced with permanent signs, as determined appropriate by the planning director. The planning director may also require that fencing be installed or native vegetation be planted or retained at a site to delineate and protect critical areas and/or their buffers. (Ord. 03-18, §21, 2003).
16.50.210 Building Setbacks. Unless otherwise provided by means of an approved critical area report or the provisions of this Chapter, buildings and other structures shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the edges of all critical area buffers or from the edges of all critical areas, if no buffers are required. The following may be allowed in the building setback area:
(1) landscaping;
(2) uncovered decks;
(3) building overhangs if such overhangs do not extend more than two feet into the setback area; and
(4) impervious ground surfaces, such as driveways, parking areas, and patios, provided that such improvements are
constructed in accordance with the city’s Design Standards.
(Ord. 03-18, §22, 2003).
16.50.220 Unauthorized Critical Area Alterations and Enforcement.
(1) Unauthorized Alteration. When a critical area or its buffer has been altered in violation of this Chapter, the city shall have the authority to issue a stop work order to cease all ongoing development work, and order restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or, where determined appropriate by the planning director, mitigation measures at the owner's or other responsible party's expense to compensate for violation of provisions of this Chapter and other applicable Pullman City Code provisions governing the applicable development permit.
(2) Restoration/Mitigation Plan Required. All development work shall remain stopped until a restoration/mitigation plan is prepared and approved by the planning director. Such a plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall describe how the actions proposed meet the minimum standards described in Subsection 16.50.220(3) and/or mitigation requirements outlined in Sections 16.50.160 through 16.50.190, if mitigation is determined to be appropriate by the planning director. The planning director shall, at the violator’s expense, seek expert advice in determining the adequacy of the plan. Inadequate plans shall be returned to the applicant or violator for revision and resubmittal.
(3) Minimum Standards for Restoration or Mitigation.
(a) For alterations to critical aquifer recharge areas, frequently flooded areas, wetlands, and habitat conservation areas, the following minimum standards shall be met for the restoration or mitigation of impacts to a critical area, provided that if the violator can demonstrate in a restoration/mitigation plan that greater functional and habitat values can be obtained, these standards may be modified by the planning director:
(i) the historic structural and functional values shall be restored, including water quality and habitat functions;
(ii) the historic soil types and configuration shall be replicated;
(iii) the critical area and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation that replicates the vegetation historically found on the site in species types, sizes, and densities; and
(iv) the historic functions and values should be replicated at the location of the alteration.
(b) For alterations to flood and geological hazards, the following minimum standards shall be met for the restoration of a critical area, provided that, if the violator can demonstrate that greater safety can be obtained, these standards may be modified:
(i) the hazard shall be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, the pre-development hazard;
(ii) any risk of personal injury resulting from the alteration shall be eliminated or minimized; and
(iii) the hazard area and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation sufficient to minimize the hazard.
(3) Penalties. Any violation or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter, or any amendment thereto, shall be a civil infraction and shall be subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed $500.00 for each violation. Each day in which a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. Any activity carried out contrary to the provisions of this Chapter shall constitute a public nuisance and may be enjoined as provided by the statutes of the state of Washington. Daily fines shall not be levied until after a violator has received a written notice of the violation and shall not be levied while a written notice of violation is under appeal through the applicable appeal process.
(Ord. 03-18, §23, 2003).
16.50.230 Financial Guarantees to Ensure Mitigation and Maintenance.
(1) Mitigation required pursuant to a development proposal should be completed prior to final project approval. When the planning director determines it is not feasible for required mitigation to be completed prior to final project approval, the planning director shall require the applicant to post a financial guarantee in a form and amount deemed acceptable by the planning director.
Acceptable financial guarantees include, but are not limited to, cash, bond, promissory note, or letter of credit.
(2) Once mitigation measures have been completed, the planning director may require a financial guarantee for maintenance of said mitigation measures.
(3) The financial guarantee shall be in the amount of 125 percent of the estimated cost of the improvements or the estimated cost of restoring the functions and values of the critical area that are at risk, whichever is greater.
(4) The financial guarantee shall remain in effect until the planning director determines, in writing, that the standards bonded for have been met. Financial guarantees for maintenance shall be held by the city for a minimum of five years to ensure that the required mitigation has been fully implemented and demonstrated to function, and may be held for longer periods when necessary.
(5) Depletion, failure, or collection of financial guarantee funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.
(6) Public development proposals shall be relieved from having to comply with the requirements of this Section if public funds have previously been committed for mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.
(7) Any failure to satisfy critical area requirements established by law or condition including, but not limited to, the failure to provide a monitoring report within 30 days after it is due or the failure to comply with other provisions of a mitigation plan may be deemed by the planning director to constitute a default, and the planning director may demand payment of any financial guarantees or require other action authorized by the Pullman City Code or any other law.
(8) Any funds recovered pursuant to this Section shall be used to complete the required mitigation.
(9) (Ord. 03-18, §24, 2003).
16.50.240 Critical Area Inspections. Reasonable access to the site shall be provided to the city, state, and federal agency review staff for the purposes of inspections during any proposal review, restoration, emergency action, or monitoring period. Additionally, the city or its agent shall have reasonable access to the site for completing necessary remediation work in the event of
noncompliance. Failure to provide access shall be deemed a violation and shall be subject to the penalties set forth in Subsection 16.50.220(4).
(Ord. 03-18, §25, 2003).
16.50.250 Designating, Rating, and Mapping Wetlands.
(1) Designating Wetlands. Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this Chapter shall be determined by a qualified professional in accordance with the most current approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas, regardless of any formal identification, and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, with the exception of areas under the jurisdiction of the city’s Shoreline Master Program, codified as Chapter 16.55.
(2) Wetland Ratings. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Department of Ecology wetland rating system found in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Eastern Washington (Department of Ecology Publication #14-06-030, or as amended and approved by the Department of Ecology). This document contains definitions and methods for determining if the general criteria below are met.
(a) Wetland Rating Categories.
(i) Category I wetlands are: 1) alkali wetlands; 2) wetlands with high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/Department of Natural Resources; 3) bogs and calcareous fens; 4) mature and old-growth forested wetlands over one-quarter acre with slow-growing trees; 5) forests with stands of aspen; and 6) wetlands that perform many functions very well (scores between 22-27 points). These wetlands are those that 1) present a unique or rare wetland type; or 2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or 3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or 4) provide a high level of function.
(ii) Category II wetlands are: 1) forested wetlands in the floodplains of rivers; 2) mature and old-growth forested wetlands over one-quarter acre with fast-growing trees; 3) vernal pools;
and 4) wetlands that perform functions well (scores between 19-21 points). These wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but still need a relatively high level of protection.
(iii)Category III wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scores between 16-18 points). Wetlands scoring between 16-18 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.
(iv) Category IV wetlands have the lowest level of functions (scores fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands should be able to be replaced, and in some cases be able to be improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions and also need to be protected.
(b) Date of Wetland Rating. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the local government, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications.
(3) Mapping. The approximate location and extent of known wetlands are shown on the pertinent city critical area map. National Wetland Inventory Maps and the city critical area map regarding wetlands are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants, and property owners, and will be periodically updated as new information becomes available. These maps are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. The exact location of a wetland's boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a qualified professional applying the delineation methods described in this Section. Wetland boundaries shall be clearly demarcated with non-degradable survey flagging labeled “WETLAND BOUNDARY” or “WETLAND DELINEATION.” Flagging shall be attached to existing vegetation or stakes at a maximum interval of 50 linear feet. Individual flags should be labeled with a wetland
identifier and consecutive numbers (e.g., A-1 through A-8).
(Ord. 19-6 §12, 2019; 07-27 §5, 2007; 03-18 §26, 2003).
16.50.260 Wetlands Critical Area Report — Additional Requirements.
(1) Areas Addressed in Report. The following areas shall be addressed in a critical area report for wetlands:
(a) the project area of the proposed activity;
(b) all wetlands and recommended buffers within 200 feet of the project area; and
(c) all shoreline areas, water features, flood plains, and other critical areas, and related buffers within 200 feet of the project area.
(2) Wetland Analysis. In addition to the minimum required contents of critical area reports in Sections 16.50.140 and 16.50.150, a critical area report for wetlands shall contain an analysis of the wetlands including the following site- and proposal-related information at a minimum:
(a) a written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers within 200 feet of the project area, including the following information at a minimum:
(i) wetland delineation and required buffers;
(ii) existing wetland acreage;
(iii)wetland category; vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics; and
(iv) soil and substrate conditions;
(b) a discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing wetlands and restore any wetlands that were degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity.
(c) proposed mitigation, if needed, including a written assessment and accompanying maps of the mitigation area, including the following information at a minimum:
(i) existing wetland acreage and proposed impact
area;
(ii) vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic conditions;
(iii) relationship within watershed and to existing water bodies;
(iv) soil and substrate conditions, topographic elevations;
(v) existing and proposed adjacent site conditions;
(vi) proposed wetland buffers; and
(vii) property ownership; and
(d) a discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect wetlands after the project site has been developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs.
(3) Additional Information. When appropriate, the planning director may also require the critical area report to include an evaluation by the Department of Ecology or an independent qualified expert regarding the applicant's analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, and to include any recommendations as appropriate.
(Ord. 19-6 §13, 2019; 03-18, §27, 2003).
16.50.270 General Requirements Pertaining to Wetlands.
(1) Activities in Wetland Areas. A proposed activity may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the activity, including associated mitigation measures, will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas.
(2) Wetland Buffers. Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter, wetland buffers are required.
(a) Standard Buffer Widths. The standard buffer widths presume the existence of a relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If the vegetation is inadequate then the buffer width shall be increased or the buffer should be planted to maintain the standard width. Required standard wetland buffers, based on wetland category and land use intensity,
are set forth in Tables 16.50.1 and 16.50.2 below.

? High-intensity recreation (golf courses, ball fields, etc.)
? Hobby farms
Moderate
? Residential
? Moderate-intensity open space (parks with biking, jogging, etc.)
? Conversion to moderate-intensity agriculture (orchards, hay fields, etc.)
? Building of logging roads
? Utility corridor or right-of-way shared by several utilities and including access/maintenance road
Low
? Forestry (cutting of trees only)
? Low-intensity open space (hiking, bird-watching, preservation of natural resources, etc.)
? Utility corridor without a maintenance road and little or no vegetation management
(b) Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category and the proposed land use. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.
(c) Increased Wetland Buffer Width. The planning director may require increased buffer width in accordance with the critical area report and the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values based on site-specific characteristics. This determination shall be based on one or more of the following criteria:
(i) a larger buffer is needed to protect other critical areas;
(ii) the buffer or adjacent uplands has an overall slope steeper than 15 percent or is susceptible to erosion and standard erosion control measures will not prevent adverse impacts to the wetland; or
(iii) the buffer area has minimal vegetative cover, although implementation of a buffer planting plan may substitute for increasing the buffer width.
In no case shall wetland buffers be increased to a width greater than two times that of the standard required buffer.
(d) Reduced Wetland Buffer Width. The planning director may allow the standard wetland buffer width to be reduced in accordance with the critical area report
and the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available on a case-by-case basis when it is determined that a smaller area is adequate to protect the wetland functions and values based on site-specific characteristics. This determination shall be supported by documentation showing that a reduced buffer is adequate based on all of the following criteria:
(i) requiring the standard buffer poses an extraordinary hardship on the landowner;
(ii) the existing buffer area is well-vegetated with native species and has an overall slope of less than ten percent; and
(iii)no direct or indirect, short-term or long-term, adverse impacts to wetlands will result from the proposed activity.
In no case shall the standard buffer width be reduced to less than either 75 percent of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II wetlands, 50 feet for Category III wetlands, and 25 feet for Category IV wetlands, whichever is greater, unless the applicant demonstrates an acceptable reasonable use as described in 16.50.120.
(e) Wetland Buffer Width Averaging. The planning director may allow modification of the standard wetland buffer width in accordance with the critical area report and the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available on a case-by-case basis by averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates that:
(i) it will not reduce wetland functions or values;
(ii) the wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;
(iii)the total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer;
and
(iv) the buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either 75 percent of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II wetlands, 50 feet for Category III wetlands, and 25 feet for Category IV wetlands, whichever is greater, unless the applicant demonstrates an acceptable reasonable use as described in 16.50.120.
(f) Buffers for Mitigation Shall be Consistent. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this Chapter.
(g) Buffer Conditions Shall be Maintained. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this Chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in their natural condition.
(h) Functionally Isolated Buffer Areas. Areas that are functionally separated from a wetland and do not provide protection to the wetland from potential adverse impacts due to preexisting roads, facilities, or vertical separation, shall be excluded from buffers otherwise required by this chapter.
(i) Allowed Buffer Uses. In addition to those uses identified in Subsection 16.50.110(3), the following uses may be allowed within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this Chapter, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:
(i) Passive Recreation Facilities. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:
(aa) Walkways and trails, provided that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for
pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing non-treated pilings may be acceptable.
(bb) Wildlife-viewing structures.
(ii) Utility Drilling. Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a buffer, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer boundary, provided that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column is disturbed.
(iii)Buffer Enhancement. Enhancement of a wetland buffer through the removal of non-native invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.
(iv)Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities are limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales. They may be allowed within the outer 25 percent of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only, provided that:
(aa) no other location is feasible; and
(bb) the location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland; and
(cc) stormwater management facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands.
(v) Non-Conforming Uses. Repair and maintenance of
non-conforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided they do not increase the degree of nonconformity.
(3) Subdivisions. The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers is subject to the following:
(a) Land that is located wholly within a wetland or its buffer may not be subdivided.
(b) Land that is located partially within a wetland or its buffer may be divided provided that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot:
(i) is located outside of the wetland and its buffer; and
(ii) meets the minimum lot size requirements of the city zoning code (Title 17).
(c) Access roads and utilities serving a proposed subdivision or other property may be permitted within the wetland and associated buffers only if the planning director determines that no other feasible alternative exists and these facilities are otherwise established consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.
(4) Signs and Fencing of Wetlands.
(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved development permit shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.
(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any development permit, the planning director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland and/or buffer. If required, permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 linear feet, whichever yields the greater amount of signs, and
must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:
“Protected Wetland Area
Do Not Disturb Contact City of Pullman
Regarding Uses and Restrictions”
(c) Fencing.
(i) As a condition of any development permit, the planning director may require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland.
(ii) The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site.
(ii) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this Paragraph shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat.
(iii)At no time shall treated wood posts (e.g., creosote) be allowed in wetland areas or in adjacent uplands to prevent chemicals from migrating into the wetland.
(Ord. 19-6 §14, 2019; 03-18, §28, 2003).
16.50.280 Compensatory Mitigation Pertaining to Wetlands.
(1) Compensatory Mitigation Plans. Projects that propose compensation for wetland acreage and/or functions are subject to state and federal regulations. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall provide for no net loss of wetland functions and values. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with the mitigation plan requirements of Section 16.50.180; Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans--Version 1, (Ecology Publication #06-06-011b, Olympia, WA, March 2006 or as amended); and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites
Using a Watershed Approach (Eastern Washington) (Publication #10-06-07, November 2010 or as amended).
(2) Mitigation for Lost Functions and Values. Mitigation actions shall address functions affected by the alteration to achieve functional equivalency or improvement, and shall provide similar wetland functions as those lost except when:
(a) the lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function assessment and the proposed mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal watershed assessment protocol; or
(b) out-of-kind replacement will best meet formally identified regional goals, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.
(3) Preference of Mitigation Actions. Mitigation actions that require compensation by replacing, enhancing, or substitution, shall occur in the following order of preference:
(a) restoring wetlands on upland sites that were formerly wetlands;
(b) creating wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of exotic introduced species;
(c) enhancing significantly degraded wetlands;
(d) preserving high-quality wetlands that are under imminent threat.
(4) Location of Mitigation.
(a) Mitigation actions shall be conducted on the same site as the alteration except when the following apply:
(i) there are no reasonable on-site opportunities or on-site opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success due to development pressures, adjacent land uses, or on-site buffers or connectivity are inadequate;
(ii) off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland.
(b) If the planning director authorizes off-site mitigation, the location of this mitigation shall be in the same drainage basin and the same Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) as the site of the alteration unless:
(i) established regional or watershed goals for water quality, flood or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or
(ii) credits from a state certified wetland mitigation bank are used as mitigation and the use of these credits justifies location of mitigation at another site.
(c) Off-site locations for mitigation should be within the city limits if feasible opportunities for appropriate mitigation are available.
(5) Mitigation Ratios.
(a) Wetland mitigation ratios shall be consistent with Table 16.50.3 below.
Table 16.50.3

(b) To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios in Table 16.50.3, the planning director may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in “Calculating Credits and
Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Eastern Washington: Final Report” (Ecology Publication #11-06-015, August 2012, or as amended).
(c) Impacts to wetland buffers shall be mitigated at a 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development.
(6) Wetland Mitigation Banks.
(a) Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:
(i) the bank is certified through applicable provisions administered by the Department of Ecology and the Army Corps of Engineers;
(ii) the planning director determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and
(iii)the proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.
(b) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.
(c) Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, bank service areas may include portions of more than one WRIA for specific wetland functions.
(7) Advance Mitigation. Mitigation for projects with pre-identified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to federal rules, state policy on advance mitigation, and state water quality regulations, consistent with Interagency Regulatory Guide: Advance Permittee Responsible Mitigation (Ecology Publication #12-06-015, Olympia, WA, December 2012 or as amended).
(8) Wetland Preservation as Mitigation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement, provided that a
minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by re-establishment or creation. Ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation generally range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being altered and the quality of the wetlands being preserved. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met:
(a) The area proposed for preservation is of high quality. The following features may be indicative of high-quality sites:
(i) Category I or II wetland rating (using the wetland rating system for eastern Washington);
(ii) Rare wetland type (for example, bogs, mature forested wetlands, estuarine wetlands);
(iii)The presence of habitat for priority or locally important wildlife species; or,
(iv) Priority sites in an adopted watershed plan.
(b) Wetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish, or other ESA-listed species.
(c) There is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin.
(d) Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost.
(e) Permanent preservation of the wetland and buffer will be provided through a conservation easement or tract held by a land trust.
(f) The impact area is small (generally less than half an acre) and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system (Category III or IV wetland).

If a scrub-shrub or forested vegetation community is proposed, monitoring may be required for ten years or more. The project mitigation plan shall include monitoring elements that ensure certainty of success for the project’s natural resource values and functions. If the mitigation goals are not obtained within the initial five-year period, the applicant remains responsible for restoration of the natural resource values and functions until the mitigation goals agreed to in the mitigation plan are achieved.
(Ord. 19-6 §16, 2019; 03-18, §30, 2003).
16.50.300 Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas Designation. Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARA) are those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). CARA have prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates that create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water. The following areas have been identified based on local conditions:
(1) Wellhead Protection Areas. Wellhead protection areas shall be defined by the boundaries of the ten (10) year time of ground water travel, or boundaries established using alternate criteria approved by the Department of Health in those settings where ground water time of travel is not a reasonable delineation criterion, in accordance with WAC 246-290-13.
(2) Special Protection Areas. Special protection areas are those areas defined by WAC 173-200-090. For the city, special protection areas shall include all areas for which perennial surface water (i.e. Paradise Creek, and portions of the South Fork Palouse River and Missouri Flat Creek) are in direct or near contact with outcroppings of either the Wanapum or Grand Ronde basalts.
All areas within the city meeting the definition of critical aquifer recharge areas, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, with the exception of areas under the jurisdiction of the city’s Shoreline Master Program, codified as Chapter 16.55.

(Ord. 19-6 §19, 2019; 03-18, §36, 2003).
16.50.360 Classification of Frequently Flooded Areas. The flood areas in the city are classified as either one of two types:
(1) Floodway. Floodways are defined as the channel of a stream and adjacent land areas which are required to carry and discharge the flood water or flood flows of any river or stream associated with a regulatory flood.
(2) Flood Fringe. The flood fringe is defined as that land area which is outside a stream’s floodway, but is subject to periodic inundation due to flooding, associated with a regulatory flood.
(Ord. 03-18, §37, 2003).
16.50.370 Designation and Mapping of Frequently Flooded
Areas. All areas within the city meeting the frequently flooded definition, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, with the exception of areas under the jurisdiction of the city’s Shoreline Master Program, codified as Chapter 16.55. The approximate location and extent of frequently flooded areas are shown on the pertinent city critical area map. This map is to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants, and property owners, and will be periodically updated as new information becomes available. This map is a reference and does not provide a final critical area designation. Frequently flooded areas have been accurately delineated based on hydrologic and hydraulic studies completed as part of the National Flood Insurance Program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in May 1981, as amended. The methodology and detail of these studies is accepted as the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available.
(Ord. 19-6 §20, 2019; 03-18, §38, 2003).
16.50.380 Existing Regulations Pertaining to Frequently Flooded Areas. Chapter 17.100 of the Pullman City Code regulates proposed activities adjacent to or within frequently flooded areas. If allowed, any structures permitted in the designated flood areas are subject to strict flood-proofing regulations.
(Ord. 19-6 §21, 2019; 03-18, §39, 2003).
16.50.390 Designation of Geologically Hazardous Areas. Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as a geologically hazardous area:
(1) erosion hazard;
(2) landslide hazard;
(3) seismic hazard;
(4) mine hazard;
(5) volcanic hazard; and
(6) other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement.
All areas within the city meeting the definition of geologically
hazardous areas, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, with the exception of areas under the jurisdiction of the city’s Shoreline Master Program, codified as Chapter 16.55.
(Ord. 19-6 §22, 2019; 03-18, §40, 2003).
16.50.400 Designation of Specific Hazard Areas.
(1) Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) as having a "moderate to severe,” “severe," or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard. Rill erosion tends to occur on slopes, particularly steep slopes with easily-erodable soils or poor vegetation. Erosion hazard areas also include those areas with a slope greater than 15 percent.
(2) Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Example of these may include, but are not limited to the following:
(a) areas of historic failures, such as:
(i) those areas delineated by the USDA-NRCS as having a "severe" limitation for building site development for factors other than slope for one or more types of building development;
(ii) those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (“U” or class 3), unstable old slides (“UOS” or class 4), or unstable recent slides (“URS” or class 5); or
(iii)areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources;
(b) areas with all three of the following characteristics:
(i) slopes steeper than 15 percent;
(ii) hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock;
and
(iii)springs or ground water seepage;
(c) areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;
(d) slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials;
(e) slopes having gradients steeper than 80 percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking;
(f) areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, streambank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;
(g) areas that show evidence of, or are at risk from snow avalanches;
(h) areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; and
(i) any area with a slope of 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of ten or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock.
(3) Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by:
(a) the magnitude of an earthquake;
(b) the distance from the source of an earthquake;
(c) the type or thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and
(d) the type of subsurface geologic structure.
Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless, loose, or soft-saturated
soils of low density, typically in association with a shallow ground water table.
(4) Mine Hazard Areas. Mine hazard areas are those areas underlain by, or affected by mine workings such as adits, gangways, tunnels, drifts, or airshafts, and those areas of probable sink holes, gas releases, or subsidence due to mine workings. Steep and unstable slopes may be created by open mines (e.g. open basalt rock pits, rock quarries, sand and gravel pits). Factors that should be considered include: proximity to development, depth from ground surface to the mine working, and geologic material.
(5) Volcanic Hazard Areas. Volcanic hazard areas are areas subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows, debris avalanche, inundation by debris flows, lahars, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from volcanic activity.
(6) Other Hazard Areas. Geologically hazardous areas shall also include areas determined by the planning director to be susceptible to other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement.
(Ord. 19-6 §23, 2019; 03-18, §41, 2003).
16.50.410 Classification of Geologically Hazardous Areas. The level of risk for each geologic hazard type is described in this Section. Documentation of specific areas in which a known or suspected risk exists for each of the following hazard areas is provided in the pertinent city critical area map.

16.50.440 Designation and Mapping of Habitat Conservation Areas.
(1) Designation. All areas within the city meeting one or more of the following criteria, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, with the exception of areas under the jurisdiction of the city’s Shoreline Master Program, codified as Chapter 16.55. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be managed consistent with the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available, such as the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Management Recommendations for Priority Habitat and Species. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall include the following:
(a) Areas Where State or Federally Designated Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species Have a Primary Association.
(i) Federally designated endangered and threatened species are those fish, wildlife and plant species identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service that are in danger of extinction or threatened to become endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service should be
consulted as necessary for current listing status.
(ii) State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are those fish and wildlife species native to the state of Washington identified by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, and those native plant species identified by the Department of Natural Resources, that are in danger of extinction, threatened to become endangered, vulnerable, or declining and are likely to become endangered or threatened in a significant portion of their range within the state without cooperative management or removal of threats. State designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species are periodically recorded in WAC 220-610-010 (state endangered species), and WAC 220-200-100 (state threatened and sensitive species). The state Department of Fish and Wildlife maintains the most current listing and should be consulted as necessary for current listing status.
(iii)A combined list of federally and state identified species having the potential to exist within the city is maintained by the Pullman planning department.
(b) State Priority Habitats and Areas Associated with State Priority Species. Priority habitats and species are considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status, sensitivity to habitat alteration, and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. A state list of priority habitats is maintained by the Pullman planning department.
(c) Habitats and Species of Local Importance. Habitats and species of local importance are those identified by the city, including those that possess unusual or unique habitat warranting
protection because of qualitative species diversity or habitat system health indicators, such as high quality native plant communities, and those with historical or cultural importance.
(d) Naturally Occurring Ponds Under 20 Acres. Naturally occurring ponds are those ponds under 20 acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide fish or wildlife habitat, including those artificial ponds intentionally created from dry areas in order to mitigate impacts to ponds. Naturally occurring ponds do not include ponds deliberately designed and created from dry sites, such as canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, temporary construction ponds, and landscape amenities, unless such artificial ponds were intentionally created for mitigation.
(e) Waters of the State. Waters of the state includes lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington, as classified in WAC 222-16.
(f) Lakes, Ponds, Streams, and Rivers Planted with Game Fish by a Governmental or Tribal Entity.
(g) State Natural Area Preserves, Natural Resource Conservation Areas, and State Wildlife Areas. Natural area preserves and natural resource conservation areas are administered by the state Department of Natural Resources, and state wildlife areas are administered by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
(h) Land Essential for Preserving Connections Between Habitat Blocks and Open Spaces.
The planning director shall be responsible for making final habitat conservation area designations within the city.
(2) Mapping. The approximate location and extent of habitat conservation areas are shown on the following maps, which are hereby adopted to provide geographic information about known or suspected habitat conservation areas:
(a) Department of Fish and Wildlife Priority Habitat and Species Maps;
(b) Department of Natural Resources, Official Water Type Reference Maps, as amended;

(c) all shoreline areas, floodplains, and other critical areas, and related buffers within 200 feet of the project area.
(3) Habitat Assessment. An investigation of the project area to evaluate the potential presence or absence of designated critical fish or wildlife species or habitat shall be conducted. An assessment of habitats shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) a detailed description of vegetation on and adjacent to the project area;
(b) identification of any species of local importance, priority species, or endangered, threatened, sensitive or candidate species that have a primary association with habitat on or adjacent to the project area, and assessment of potential project impacts to the use of the site by the species;
(c) a discussion of any federal, state, or local special management recommendations, including Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat management recommendations, that have been developed for species or habitats located on or adjacent to the project area;
(d) a discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization, and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing habitats and restore any habitat that was degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity and to be conducted in accordance with Section 16.50.160; and
(e) a discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect habitat after the project site has been developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs.
(4) Additional Information. When appropriate due to the type of habitat or species present or the project area conditions, the planning director may also require the critical area report to include:
(a) an evaluation by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife or qualified expert regarding the applicant's analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, to include any recommendations as appropriate; and
(b) detailed surface and subsurface hydrologic features both on and adjacent to the site.
(Ord. 19-6 §27, 2019; 03-18 §46, 2003)
16.50.460 General Requirements Pertaining to Habitat Conservation Areas.
(1) Alterations Shall Not Degrade the Functions and Values of Habitat. A habitat conservation area may be altered only if the proposed activity, including associated mitigation measures, does not degrade the quantitative and
qualitative functions and values of the habitat and other critical areas.
(2) Non-indigenous Species Shall Not Be Introduced. No plant, wildlife, or fish species not indigenous to the region shall be introduced into a habitat conservation area unless authorized by a local, state, or federal permit or approval.
(3) Mitigation Shall Result in Contiguous Corridors. Mitigation sites shall be located to achieve contiguous wildlife habitat corridors in accordance with a mitigation plan that is part of the critical area report to minimize the isolating effects of development on habitat areas, so long as mitigation of aquatic habitat is located within the same aquatic ecosystem as the area disturbed.
(4) Approvals of Activities May be Conditioned. The planning director shall condition approvals of activities allowed within or adjacent to a habitat conservation area or its buffers, as necessary to minimize or mitigate any potential adverse impacts.

Mitigation shall address each function affected by the alteration to achieve functional equivalency or improvement on a per function basis.
(6) Approvals Shall be Supported by the Most Current, Accurate, and Complete Scientific and Technical
Information Available. Any approval of alterations or impacts to a habitat conservation area shall be supported by the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available.
(7) Buffers.
(a) Establishment of Buffers. The planning director shall require the establishment of buffer areas for activities in, or adjacent to, habitat conservation areas when needed to protect habitat conservation areas. Buffers shall consist of an undisturbed area of native vegetation, or areas identified for restoration, established to protect the integrity, functions, and values of the affected habitat. Required buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the habitat and the type and intensity of human activity proposed to be conducted nearby, and shall be consistent with the management recommendations issued by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
(b) Increased Habitat Buffers. The planning director may require increased buffer widths in accordance with recommendations of a qualified professional biologist and the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available when it is determined that a larger buffer is necessary to protect habitat area functions and values due to site-specific characteristics.
(c) Habitat Buffer Averaging. The planning director may allow the recommended habitat area buffer width to be reduced in accordance with a critical area report, the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available, and the management recommendations issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, only if:
(i) it will not reduce stream or habitat functions;
(ii) it will not adversely affect salmonid habitat;
(iii)it will provide additional natural resource protection, such as buffer enhancement;
(iv) the total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer;
and
(v) the buffer area width is not reduced by more than twenty-five percent (25%) in any location.
(d) Seasonal Restrictions. When a species is more susceptible to adverse impacts during specific periods of the year, seasonal restrictions may apply. Larger buffers may be required and activities may be further restricted during the specified season.
(8) Signs and Fencing of Habitat Conservation Areas.
(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the habitat conservation area or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to a development permit shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and verified by the planning director prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.
(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any development permit issued pursuant to this Chapter, the planning director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a habitat conservation area or buffer. If required, permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 linear feet, whichever yields the greater amount of signs, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:
“Habitat Conservation Area
Do Not Disturb
Contact City of Pullman
Regarding Uses and Restrictions”
(c) Fencing.
(i) As a condition of any development permit, the planning director may require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the habitat conservation area or buffer when
fencing will prevent future impacts to the habitat conservation area.
(ii) The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the habitat conservation area or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site.
(iii) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this Paragraph shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes habitat impacts.
(9) Subdivisions. The subdivision and short subdivision of land in habitat conservation areas and associated buffers is subject to the following:
(a) Land that is located wholly within a habitat conservation area or its buffer may not be subdivided.
(b) Land that is located partially within a habitat conservation area or its buffer may be divided provided that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot:
(i) is located outside of the habitat conservation area and its buffer; and
(ii) meets the minimum lot size requirements of city’s zoning code (Title 17).
(c) Access roads and utilities serving a proposed subdivision or other property may be permitted within the habitat conservation area and associated buffers only if the planning director determines that no other feasible alternative exists and these facilities are otherwise established consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 19-6 §28, 2019; 03-18, §47, 2003).
16.50.470 Development Standards for Specific Species or Habitats.
(1) Endangered, Threatened, and Sensitive Species.
(a) No development shall be allowed within a habitat conservation area or buffer with which state or
federally endangered, threatened, or sensitive species have a primary association.
(b) Whenever activities are proposed adjacent to a habitat conservation area with which state or federally endangered, threatened, or sensitive species have a primary association, such area shall be protected through the application of protection measures in accordance with a critical area report prepared by a qualified professional and submitted to the planning director. Approval for alteration of land adjacent to the habitat conservation area or its buffer shall not occur prior to consultation with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the appropriate federal agency.
(2) Wetland Habitats. All proposed activities within or adjacent to habitat conservation areas containing wetlands shall, at a minimum, conform to the wetland standards set forth in Sections 16.50.250 through 16.50.290, in addition to meeting the habitat conservation area standards in Sections 16.50.440 through 16.50.470.
(3) Riparian Habitat Areas.
(a) Activities Shall Not Degrade the Functions and Values of Riparian Habitat. Unless otherwise allowed in this Chapter, all structures and activities shall be located outside of the riparian habitat area. A proposed activity may only be permitted in a riparian habitat area if the applicant can show that the activity, including associated mitigation measures, will not degrade the functions and values of the riparian habitat area and other critical areas.
(b) Establishment of Riparian Habitat Areas. Riparian habitat areas shall be established for habitats that include aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that mutually benefit each other and that are located adjacent to rivers, perennial or intermittent streams, seeps and springs.
(c) Classification. Streams are classified using the following Water Typing System described in WAC 222-16-031, as amended:
(i) Type S: Type S waters are shorelines of the state.
(ii) Type F: Type F waters are perennial or
seasonal, fish bearing waters.
(iii) Type Np: Type Np waters are non-fish bearing perennial waters.
(iv) Type Ns: Type Ns waters are non-fish bearing seasonal waters.
(d) Standard Riparian Habitat Area Widths. Standard riparian habitat area widths are shown in Table 16.50.8 below. A riparian habitat area shall have the required width, unless a greater width is required pursuant to Paragraph 16.50.470(3)(e), or a lesser width is allowed pursuant to Paragraph 16.50.470(3)(f). Widths shall be measured outward, on the horizontal plane, from the ordinary high water mark or from the top of bank if the ordinary high water mark cannot be identified. Table 16.50.8 Standard Riparian Habitat Area Widths Stream Type Standard Riparian Habitat Area Widths
Type S: shorelines of the state
250 feet
Type F: perennial or seasonal fish bearing waters (South Fork of Palouse River, Missouri Flat Creek, Sunshine Creek, Paradise Creek, Dry Fork Creek, and Airport Road Creek)
200 feet
Type Np: non-fish bearing perennial waters
Type Ns: non-fish bearing seasonal waters

? For water-dependent developments, there is no minimum riparian habitat area width. Apply mitigation sequencing to avoid and minimize adverse impacts during development siting.
? For all developments, riparian habitat area widths are the lesser of the distance indicated above, or (if present) the waterward edge of an improved public road or railroad intersecting the riparian habitat area.
(e)Increased Riparian Habitat Area Width. The standard riparian habitat area width shall be increased, as follows:
(i) when the planning director determines that the standard width is insufficient to prevent habitat degradation and to protect the structure and functions of the habitat area; and/or
(ii) when the planning director determines that the standard width is insufficient to protect human life and development from frequently flooded areas, geologically hazardous areas, or channel migration zones.
(f) Riparian Habitat Area Width Averaging. The planning director may allow the standard riparian habitat area width to be reduced in accordance with a critical area report only if:
(i) the width reduction will not reduce stream habitat functions, including those of non-fish habitat;
(ii) the width reduction will not degrade the habitat;
(iii)the proposal will provide additional habitat protection;
(iv) the total riparian habitat area of each stream on the development proposal site is not decreased;
(v) the width is not reduced by more than 25 percent in any one location;
(vi) the width reduction will not be located within another critical area or associated buffer; and
(vii)the reduced width is supported by the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available.
(g) Riparian Habitat Mitigation. Mitigation of adverse impacts to riparian habitat areas shall result in equivalent functions and values on a per function basis, be located as near the alteration as feasible, and be located in the same sub-drainage basin as the habitat impacted.
(h) Alternative Mitigation for Riparian Habitat Areas. The requirements set forth in this Section may be modified at the planning director's discretion if
the applicant demonstrates that greater habitat functions, on a per function basis, can be obtained in the affected sub-drainage basin as a result of alternative mitigation measures.
(i) Uses and Modifications Allowed in Riparian Habitat Areas. The following uses are allowed in riparian habitat areas provided that mitigation sequencing pursuant to Section 16.50.170 is demonstrated, and any adverse impacts to ecological functions are mitigated.
(i) Water-Dependent Uses. Consistent with the provisions of this Chapter, water-dependent uses, modifications and activities may be located in riparian habitat areas at the water’s edge.
(ii) Accessories to Water-Dependent Uses. Uses, developments and activities accessory to water-dependent uses should be located outside any applicable standard or reduced riparian habitat area unless at least one of the following is met:
(aa) proximity to the water-dependent project elements is critical to the successful implementation of the facility’s purpose and the elements are supportive of the water-dependent use and have no other utility (e.g., a road to a boat launch facility, facilities that support aquaculture); or
(bb) the proposed accessory would be located in a park or on other public lands where recreational development is already legally established, and the accessory would not conflict with or limit opportunities for other water-oriented uses; or
(cc) the accessory use, development, or activity can be located upland of the water-dependent use; or
(dd) the applicant’s lot has topographical constraints where no other location of the development is feasible (e.g., the water-dependent use or activity is located on a parcel entirely or substantially encumbered by the required
buffer).
In these circumstances, uses and modifications accessory to water-dependent uses must be designed and located to minimize intrusion into the buffer.
(iii)Water-Oriented Public Access and Recreation Facilities. New development and redevelopment of water-oriented public access and recreation structures are allowed in riparian habitat areas provided the applicant can demonstrate that the design applies mitigation sequencing and appropriate mitigation is provided to ensure no net loss of ecological functions. The City may review and condition the project to fully implement the provisions of this Chapter.
(iv) Temporary Agricultural Equipment and Facilities. New agricultural equipment and facilities, excluding buildings, may be placed in a buffer if the following conditions are satisfied:
(aa) placement of the equipment and facilities must support an existing agricultural use;
(bb) the equipment and facilities may only be in the buffer on a temporary or seasonal basis, a maximum of eight (8) months in a running 12-month period;
(cc) placement outside of a buffer is not feasible because it would be located on a property owned by another landowner or it would interfere with another agricultural or authorized use;
(dd) the location of the proposed equipment and facilities is on an already altered site, and would not result in harm to or removal of native vegetation; and
(ee) best management practices are utilized to prevent adverse impacts to water quality or other ecological functions.
(v) Shoreline Residential Access. A private access pathway constructed of pervious materials may be installed, a maximum of four feet wide, through the riparian habitat area
to the ordinary high water mark. Impervious materials may be used as needed to construct a safe, tiered pathway down a slope. Raised boardwalks may also be constructed through wetland areas to reach the shoreline waterbody consistent with the provisions of this Chapter. A railing may be installed on one edge of the pathway, and shall be a maximum of 36 inches tall and of open construction. Pathways to the shoreline should take the most direct route feasible consistent with appropriate safety standards.
(j) Standards for Specific Activities in Riparian Habitat Areas. In addition to the general review procedures set forth in Section 16.50.130 and other applicable provisions of this Chapter, the standards below apply to specific activities proposed to be located within a riparian habitat area to ensure maintenance or enhancement of the functions and values of the affected habitat area.
(i) Clearing and Grading. Clearing and grading operations shall comply with the following standards:
(aa) grading shall be conducted only when soil conditions are dry and the potential for erosion is low;
(bb) tilling or modification of a wetland or wetland buffer is permitted only if it is conducted as part of an approved wetland alteration;
(cc) the soil duff layer shall remain undisturbed to the maximum extent possible, and where feasible, any soil disturbed shall be redistributed to other areas of the project area;

16.55.010 Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of Pullman Shoreline Master Program (the “Program,” “Master Program,” or “SMP”).
(Ord. 16-3 §2, 2016)
16.55.020 Adoption Authority. This Program is adopted under the authority granted by the Shoreline Management Act (Act) of 1971, Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Chapter 90.58, and Washington Administrative Code (WAC) Chapter 173-26 as amended.
(Ord. 16-3 §3, 2016)
16.55.030 Purpose and Intent. Washington’s Shoreline Management Act (RCW 90.58) was passed by the State Legislature in 1971 and adopted by the public in a referendum. The SMA was created in response to a growing concern among residents of the state that serious and permanent damage was being done to shorelines by unplanned and uncoordinated development. The goal of the SMA was “to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the state’s shorelines.” While protecting shoreline resources by regulating development, the SMA is also intended to provide for appropriate shoreline use by encouraging land uses that enhance and conserve shoreline functions and values. The SMA has three broad policies:
(1) Encourage water-dependent and water-oriented uses: "uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment, or are unique to or dependent upon use of the states' shorelines....”
(2) Promote public access: “the public’s opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the state shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state and the people generally."
(3) Protect shoreline natural resources, including "...the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the waters of the state and their aquatic life...."
The intent of the City of Pullman Shoreline Master Program is to ensure comprehensive planning for the City’s shorelines and to ensure the adoption and implementation of use regulations, together with maps, diagrams, charts, or other descriptive material and text, a statement of desired goals, and standards developed in accordance with the policies adopted by the State.
(Ord. 16-3 §4, 2016)
16.55.040 Purpose and Relationship to State Planning and Shoreline Laws. Washington State’s citizens voted to approve the Shoreline Management Act (SMA) of 1971 in November 1972. In accordance with the SMA, Whitman County and incorporated cities and towns developed and adopted their first Shoreline Master
Program (SMP) in 1974. The SMA and implementing SMP Guidelines require all towns, cities, and counties across the state to comprehensively update their SMPs. The SMP update allows preparations of a locally tailored program that represents the visions and interests of our citizens and meets the needs of our rural communities. The goals, policies, and regulations of this Program are intended to be consistent with the State shoreline guidelines in WAC 173-26. After the City’s local development and adoptions process is complete, the SMP is reviewed by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) to ensure compliance with the SMP Guidelines. The SMP does not become effective until it has been adopted by the City and approved by Ecology.
(Ord. 16-3 §5, 2016)
16.55.050 Applicability.
(1) Unless specifically exempted by statute, all proposed uses and development occurring within the shoreline jurisdiction must conform to chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act and this Master Program whether or not a permit is required.
(2) Except as described in Subsection 16.55.050(3), all proposed uses and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to the intent and requirements of the laws and rules cited in Section 16.55.020 (Adoption Authority).
(3) This SMP does not apply to the following activities:
(a) Consistent with Section 16.55.100 (Definitions), WAC 173-26-020 (Definitions), and WAC 173-26-241(3)(a), as amended, agricultural activities on agricultural lands as of the date of adoption of the SMP.
(b) Interior building improvements that do not change the use or occupancy;
(c) Exterior structure maintenance activities, including painting and roofing, as long as it does not expand the existing footprint of the structure;
(d) Routine landscape maintenance of established, ornamental landscaping, such as lawn mowing, pruning and weeding; and
(e) As of the effective date of the SMP, legal pre-existing residential uses and structures where no change or new activity is proposed.
(4) Activities that are exempt from the permit system in Subsection 16.55.160(2) shall comply with this SMP whether or not a permit or other form of authorization is required.
(5) The shoreline permit procedures, policies and regulations established in this SMP shall apply City-wide to all non-federal uses, activities, and development.
(6) This SMP applies to lands subject to non-federal ownership, lease or easement, even though such lands may fall within the external boundaries of a federal ownership.
(7) This SMP does not apply to annexed areas unless the requirements of WAC 173-26-150 and 160 are complied with. The City has predesignated shorelines in the urban growth area. Until annexed, development in these areas shall be regulated by the Whitman County Shoreline Master Program. Once annexed, those properties shall be regulated by the City of Pullman Shoreline Master Program.
(8) A proposed project or plan shall become vested to this Shoreline Master Program on the date a determination of completeness is made on a shoreline permit or exemption application. Thereafter, the application shall be reviewed under the shoreline regulations in effect on the date of vesting; provided, in the event an applicant substantially changes the proposal after a determination of completeness, as determined by the SMP Administrator, the application shall not be considered vested until a new determination of completeness on the changes is made.
(Ord. 16-3 §6, 2016)
16.55.060 Liberal Construction. As provided for in RCW 90.58.900 (Liberal Construction), the Act is exempted from the rule of strict construction; the Act and this Program shall therefore be liberally construed to give full effect to the purposes, goals, objectives, and policies for which the Act and this Program were enacted and adopted.
(Ord. 16-3 §7, 2016)
16.55.070 Interpretation. The Act and this Program adopted pursuant thereto comprise the basic State and City law regulating use of shorelines in the City of Pullman. In the event provisions of this Program conflict with other applicable
City policies or regulations, the more restrictive shall prevail.
(Ord. 16-3 §8, 2016)
16.55.080 Effective Date. The SMP is hereby adopted on the 29th day of March, 2016. This SMP and all amendments thereto shall become effective 14 days from the date of the Washington State Department of Ecology’s written notice of final approval.
(Ord. 16-3 §9, 2016)
16.55.090 Document Organization. The SMP establishes long-term planning goals and policies; specific development standards and use regulations; and permitting and administrative procedures.

obtain a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit, but shall obtain a Letter or Statement of Exemption, as provided for in Subsections 16.55.160(2) and 16.55.160(4).
(4) Letter or Statement of Exemption.
(a) Letter of Exemption
(i) A Letter of Exemption shall be issued by the City when a development application is determined to meet the listed criteria for an exemption and the development is subject to a section 404 permit under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (generally applying to any project which may involve discharge of dredge or fill material to any water or wetland area).
(ii) The Letter shall indicate the specific exemption provision from WAC 173-27-040 that is being applied to the development and provide a summary of the City’s analysis of the consistency of the project with this SMP and the SMA. The Letter shall be sent to the applicant and the Department of Ecology.
(b) Statement of Exemption
(i) The City may grant or deny requests for Statements of Exemption from the Shoreline Substantial Development Permit requirement. The Statement shall be in writing and shall indicate the specific exemption of this Program that is being applied to the development, and shall provide a summary of the analysis of the consistency of the project with this Program and the Act.
(ii) The City shall issue a Statement of Exemption to an applicant whose project meets any of the exemptions listed in Subsection 16.55.160(3) when the City has determined that said project may alter or disturb the ground or vegetation.

(c) The contents of permit applications must be consistent with WAC 173-27-180 and Pullman City Code.
(d) Where this SMP requires more information than the minimum required by WAC 173-27-180, the SMP Administrator may vary or waive requirements beyond WAC 173-27-180 if the information is unnecessary to process the application.
(e) At the time of application, the applicant must pay the application fee as set by resolution of the Pullman City Council.
(6) Shoreline Substantial Development Permit.
(a) A Shoreline Substantial Development Permit shall be required for all development of shorelines, unless the proposal is specifically exempt per Subsection 16.55.160(2) (Exemptions from a Substantial Development Permit) or is not subject to the SMP per Section 16.55.050 (Applicability).
(b) A Shoreline Substantial Development Permit shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with:
(i) The policies and procedures of the SMA;
(ii) The provisions of WAC 173-27; and
(iii) This SMP.
(c) The City may attach conditions to the approval of permits as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the SMA and this SMP.
(d) Nothing shall interfere with the City’s ability to require compliance with all other applicable plans and laws.
(7) Shoreline Conditional Use Permit. A Shoreline Conditional Use Permit is intended to allow for the flexibility and the exercise of judgement in the application of regulations in a manner consistent with the policies of the Act and this Master Program. While not prohibited, these uses are an exception to the general rule.
(a) Uses specifically classified or set forth in this SMP as conditional uses shall be subject to review and condition by the Board of Adjustment/Hearing Examiner and by Ecology. Shoreline Conditional Use Permit applications shall be processed consistent with this SMP and Chapter 17.125 (Conditional Use Permits).

(d) Uses which are classified or set forth in this SMP as conditional uses may be authorized provided that the applicant demonstrates that the criteria in WAC 173-27-160(1) have been met.
(e) In the granting of all Shoreline Conditional Use Permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if Shoreline Conditional Use Permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.
(8) Shoreline Variance.
(a) The purpose of a variance is to grant relief to specific bulk or dimensional requirements set forth in this SMP where there are extraordinary
or unique circumstances relating to the property such that the strict implementation of this SMP would impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020. Variances from the use regulations of the SMP are prohibited. Shoreline Variance applications shall be processed consistent with this SMP and Chapter 17.130 (Variances).
(b) Shoreline Variance permits should be granted in circumstances where denial of the permit would conflict with the goals of the SMA as listed in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances, the applicant must demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances exist and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.
(c) Shoreline Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located landward of the OHWM, as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), and/or landward of any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate that the criteria in WAC 173-27-170(2) have been met.
(d) Shoreline Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the OHWM, as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), or within any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate that the criteria in WAC 173-27-170(3) have been met.
(e) In the granting of all Shoreline Variance permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments and/or uses in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.
(Ord. 16-3 §17, 2016)

A use of property that is unlawful under other local, state, or federal laws shall not be deemed a non-conforming use.
(b) Any use which existed prior to adoption of this Master Program or applicability of this Master Program to the property and which is not listed as a permitted use shall be considered a non-conforming use.
(c) If a non-conforming use is replaced by a conforming use for any length of time, use of the property shall not revert to the non-conforming use. The mere presence of a structure shall not constitute the continuance of a non-conforming use.
(d) In accordance with Pullman City Code Chapter 17.30, when a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of one year or more without replacement by a conforming use, legal conforming use status expires and further use of the structure or lot must be in compliance with the provisions of this Master Program.
(e) In accordance with Pullman City Code Chapter 17.30, if any non-conforming use is not occupied or operated because its building has sustained damage amounting to less than seventy-five percent (75%) of its value, that use may be reestablished if construction of a new or repaired building begins within one year of the date the damage occurred.
(f) In accordance with Pullman City Code Chapter 17.30, non-conforming single-family dwellings in the C2 and C3 districts may be enlarged or expanded provided that the minimum yard requirements for residences in the R4 zone district are observed.
(3) Non-conforming Lots.
(a) Development on non-conforming lots shall comply with this Master Program and Pullman City Code Section 17.30.040. Any permitted use or structure may be erected on any existing lot or parcel. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the minimum dimensional requirements of this SMP, provided that such structure is allowed within the shoreline environment designation and all uses of the nonconforming lot shall comply with all other provisions of this Master Program and underlying zoning requirements including minimum yard requirements, dimensional standards, and lot coverage requirements.
(b) Structures and customary accessory buildings on non-conforming lots shall be set back from the OHWM to the greatest extent feasible. Development proposed inside required buffers shall apply mitigation sequencing and shall require a mitigation plan.

(c) A structure for which a variance has been issued shall be considered a legal non-conforming structure, and the requirements of this Section shall apply as they apply to pre-existing non-conforming structures and uses.
(d) Legally existing structures used for a conforming use but which are non-conforming with regard to setbacks, buffers, or yards; area; bulk; height
or density may be maintained and repaired and may be enlarged or expanded, provided that said enlargement does not increase the extent of non-conformity by further encroaching upon or extending into areas where construction or use would not be allowed for new development or uses.
(e) Alteration or expansion of a non-conforming use or structure is allowed if necessary to accommodate handicapped accessibility requirements, fire code, or other life safety related requirements mandated by local, state, or federal law.
(5) Pre-existing Legal Residential Uses. Notwithstanding Subsections 16.55.170(1) through 16.55.170(4), the following shall apply only to pre-existing legal residential structures constructed prior to the effective date of this Chapter:
(a) Residential structures and appurtenant structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use, but that do not meet standards for the following shall be considered a conforming structure: Setback, buffers, or yards; area; bulk; height; or density.
(b) The City shall allow redevelopment, expansion, or change with the class of occupancy, of the residential structure if it is consistent with the SMP, including requirements for no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. For example, vertical, lateral or anterior expansions that do not intrude farther into a required buffer and which are consistent with the maximum height allowed by this SMP and underlying zoning may be allowed.
(c) Pre-existing legal residential structures that are damaged or destroyed may be replaced to their prior size and location.
(d) For purposes of this Section, “appurtenant structures” means garages, sheds, and other legally established structures. “Appurtenant structures” does not include bulkheads and other shoreline modifications or over-water structures.

16.55.190 Shoreline Vision. It shall be the ultimate goal of the City of Pullman SMP to provide plans, policies and regulations consistent with the SMA (RCW 90.58) and with the SMP Guidelines (WAC 173-26), which will reflect the desires of the
citizens of the City of Pullman regarding the balanced use of the City’s shoreline.
The following statements of goals and policies are directed to address individual elements as outlined in the SMA and SMP Guidelines.
(Ord. 16-3 §20, 2016)
16.55.200 Shoreline Goals.
(1) Shoreline Use.
(a) Support shoreline uses that are consistent with the existing and historic pattern of development in the City of Pullman to maintain and enhance the local economy and expand visual and physical public access to the shoreline.
(b) Promote the best use of the City of Pullman shoreline through encouraging shoreline development and modifications that are placed wisely, consistent with the physical limitations of the area; serve the needs and desires of the local citizens; and protect the functions and values of the shorelines.
(c) Assure a distribution and pattern of land use along the shoreline that balances protection of the existing character of the City as well as the shoreline environments, habitat, and ecological systems.
(2) Economic Development.
(a) Promote local economic opportunities and encourage development along shorelines that is compatible with existing environmental conditions and the desired land use character of the City of Pullman’s shorelines. Shoreline economic growth and prosperity should take into account the historic development pattern and existing character of the built environment.
(b) Permit those commercial, industrial, recreational, and other developments that are appropriately located along the shoreline and which may contribute to the economic well-being of the City of Pullman while achieving no net loss of ecological function.
(c) Promote new water-dependent, water-related, and water-enjoyment economic development, with
preference given to water-dependent uses, then water-related uses and water-enjoyment uses.
(3) Public Access.
(a) Preserve and protect opportunities for the public to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the City of Pullman’s shorelines.
(b) Ensure an adequate supply of safe public access to the City of Pullman’s shoreline.
(c) Encourage that alteration to the natural conditions of the shorelines, in those limited instances when authorized, shall be given priority for development that provides opportunity for substantial numbers of people to enjoy the shorelines of the state, while maintaining no net loss of ecological function.
(4) Recreation.
(a) Protect and expand opportunities for recreation in the City of Pullman’s shoreline areas, including but not limited to parks and other recreational areas.
(b) Encourage and maximize water-oriented recreational opportunities along the shoreline.
(5) Conservation.
(a) Encourage sound management of renewable shoreline resources and protection of non-renewable shoreline resources.
(b) Achieve sustainability of resource functions and values and no-net-loss of ecological functions by allowing shoreline development and modifications when impacts are minimized through mitigation sequencing and by encouraging and incentivizing restoration of ecological functions where they have been impaired.
(c) Promote and protect the scenic aesthetic quality of shoreline areas and vistas to the greatest extent feasible.
(6) Transportation and Circulation.
(a) Address the location of existing and proposed transportation routes, terminals, and other public utilities and facilities used for the
movement of people, vehicles, and goods and services in the City of Pullman’s shorelines.
(b) Maintain adequate safety, environmental, and aesthetic standards for existing and new transportation systems within shoreline jurisdiction.
(c) Minimize conflicts between systems of circulation and shoreline uses when considering additions or modifications.
(7) Restoration.
(a) Upgrade shoreline ecological functions and aesthetics to a level commensurate with their importance to the community and to achievement of regional goals for water quality and habitat recovery, such as through the projects, programs and plans established within the SMP Shoreline Restoration Plan.
(b) Facilitate the permitting for restoration projects, and coordinate with agencies, tribes, and non-profit groups to achieve effective restoration of shoreline ecological functions and maximize public funding.
(8) Archaeological, Historical, and Cultural Resources. Identify, preserve, protect and restore buildings, sites, or areas of the shoreline that have historic, cultural, archeological, scientific, or educational value.
(9) Flood Hazard Management. Protect the City of Pullman from losses and damage created by flooding along the shoreline.
(Ord. 16-3 §21, 2016)
16.55.210 Shoreline Jurisdiction and Use Preferences.
(1) Definition.
(a) As defined by the Shoreline Management Act of 1971, shorelines include certain waters of the State plus their associated “shorelands.” The waterbodies designated as shorelines of the State are streams whose mean annual flow is 20 cubic feet per second (cfs) or greater and lakes whose area is greater than 20 acres.
(b) Shorelands, as adopted by the City of Pullman and indicated on the Official Shoreline Maps
available for review in the Planning Department, are defined as:
“those lands extending landward for 200 feet in all directions as measured on a horizontal plane from the ordinary high water mark; floodways and contiguous floodplain areas landward 200 feet from such floodways; and all wetlands and river deltas associated with the streams, lakes, and tidal waters which are subject to the provisions of this chapter….” (RCW 90.58.030)
The City of Pullman will not extend shoreline jurisdiction to encompass critical area buffers that otherwise extend outside of the minimum shoreline jurisdiction.
(c) The extent of shoreline jurisdiction is indicated on the Official Shoreline Maps available for review in the City Planning Department. The purpose of the Official Shoreline Maps is to identify Environment Designations (Section 16.55.220). The maps only approximately identify or depict the lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction. The actual lateral extent of the shoreline jurisdiction shall be determined on a site-specific basis based on the location of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), floodway, floodplain, and presence of associated wetlands.
(d) In circumstances where shoreline jurisdiction does not include an entire parcel, only that portion of the parcel within shoreline jurisdiction and any use, activity or development proposed within shoreline jurisdiction on that portion of the parcel is subject to this Shoreline Master Program.
(2) General Shoreline Use Preferences.
(a) This SMP adopts the following policy provided in RCW 90.58.020, and fully implements it to the extent of its authority under this SMP:
“It is the policy of the State to provide for the management of the shorelines of the State by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses. This policy is designed to insure the development of
these shorelines in a manner which, while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in the navigable waters, will promote and enhance the public interest. This policy contemplates protecting against adverse effects to the public health, the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the waters of the State and their aquatic life, while protecting generally public rights of navigation and corollary rights incidental thereto...
In the implementation of this policy, the public's opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the State shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the State and the people generally. To this end uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment, or are unique to or dependent upon use of the state's shoreline. Alterations of the natural condition of the shorelines of the state, in those limited instances when authorized, shall be given priority for single family residences and their appurtenant structures, ports, shoreline recreational uses including but not limited to parks, marinas, piers, and other improvements facilitating public access to shorelines of the state, industrial and commercial developments which are particularly dependent on their location on or use of the shorelines of the state and other development that will provide an opportunity for substantial numbers of the people to enjoy the shorelines of the state. Alterations of the natural condition of the shorelines and shorelands of the state shall be recognized by the [D]epartment [of Ecology]. Shorelines and shorelands of the state shall be appropriately classified and these classifications shall be revised when circumstances warrant regardless of whether the change in circumstances occurs through man-made causes or natural causes. Any areas
resulting from alterations of the natural condition of the shorelines and shorelands of the state no longer meeting the definition of "shorelines of the state" shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter 90.58 RCW.
Permitted uses in the shorelines of the State shall be designed and conducted in a manner to minimize, insofar as practical, any resultant damage to the ecology and environment of the shoreline area and any interference with the public's use of the water.”
(b) When determining allowable uses and resolving use conflicts on shorelines within jurisdiction consistent with the above policy, the following preferences and priorities as listed in WAC 173-26-201(2)(d) shall be applied in the order presented below:
(i) Reserve appropriate areas for protecting and restoring ecological functions to control pollution and prevent damage to the natural environment and public health.
(ii) Reserve shoreline areas for water-dependent and associated water-related uses … Local governments may prepare master program provisions to allow mixed-use developments that include and support water-dependent uses and address specific conditions that affect water-dependent uses.
(iii) Reserve shoreline areas for other water-related and water-enjoyment uses that are compatible with ecological protection and restoration objectives.
(iv) Locate single-family residential uses where they are appropriate and can be developed without significant impact to ecological functions or displacement of water-dependent uses.
(v) Limit nonwater-oriented uses to those locations where the above described uses are inappropriate or where nonwater-oriented uses demonstrably contribute to the objectives of the Shoreline Management Act.
(Ord. 16-3 §22, 2016)
16.55.220 Shoreline Environment Designations.
(1) Shoreline Residential.
(a) Purpose: The purpose of the Shoreline Residential environment is to accommodate residential development and appurtenant structures that are consistent with the SMP. An additional purpose is to provide appropriate public access and recreational uses.
(b) Designation Criteria: Assign a Shoreline Residential environment designation to areas that are predominantly single-family or multi-family residential development or are planned and platted for residential development.
(c) Management Policies:
(i) Shoreline development standards should ensure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions, taking into account the environmental limitations and sensitivity of the shoreline area, the level of infrastructure and services available, and other comprehensive planning considerations.
(ii) Multi-family and multiple-lot residential and recreational developments should provide public access and joint use for community recreational facilities.
(iii) Access, utilities, and public services should be available and adequate to serve existing needs and/or planned future development.
(iv) Commercial development should be limited to water-oriented uses and allowed only when the underlying zoning permits such uses.
(2) Shoreline Parks.
(a) Purpose: The purpose of the Shoreline Parks environment is to:
(i) Protect ecological functions of open space, floodplain and other sensitive public or protected lands and conserve existing natural resources and valuable historic and cultural areas while allowing a variety of compatible uses; and
(ii) Ensure appropriate management and development of existing and future public parks and recreation areas.
(b) Designation Criteria: Assign a Shoreline Parks environment designation to shoreline areas if any of the following characteristics apply:
(i) They are within existing or planned public parks or public lands intended to accommodate public access and recreational developments;
(ii) They are suitable for water-related or water-enjoyment uses;
(iii) They are open space, floodplain or other sensitive areas that should not be more intensively developed;
(iv) They have potential for ecological restoration;
(v) They retain important ecological functions, even though partially developed; or
(vi) They have the potential for development that is compatible with ecological restoration.
(c) Management Policies:
(i) Uses in the Shoreline Parks environment should be limited to those which sustain the shoreline area's physical and biological resources and uses of a non-permanent nature that do not substantially degrade ecological functions or the rural or natural character of the shoreline area.
(ii) Except in support of agriculture, aquaculture, and recreation uses, commercial and industrial uses should not be allowed.
(iii) Water-oriented uses should be given priority over nonwater-oriented uses. Water-dependent and water-enjoyment recreation facilities and uses that do not deplete the resource over time, such as boating facilities, fishing, hunting, wildlife viewing trails, swimming beaches, and scientific, historical, cultural, and educational research uses, are preferred, provided
adverse impacts to the shoreline are mitigated.
(iv) Shoreline development standards should ensure that new development does not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or further degrade other shoreline values.
(v) Existing uses and development, including roadways and railroads, may be maintained and expanded consistent with provisions of this SMP.
(vi) Public access and public recreation objectives on public lands should be implemented when appropriate and when adverse ecological impacts can be mitigated.
(vii) Construction of new structural shoreline stabilization and flood control works should only be allowed where there is a documented need to protect an existing structure or ecological functions, and only when mitigation is applied.
(3) High Intensity.
(a) Purpose: The purpose of the High Intensity environment is to provide for high-intensity water-oriented commercial, transportation, and industrial uses while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions in areas that have been previously degraded.
(b) Designation Criteria: Assign a High Intensity environment designation to shoreline areas within incorporated municipalities and urban growth areas if they currently support high-intensity uses related to commerce, transportation or navigation; or are suitable and planned for high-intensity water-oriented uses.
(c) Management Policies.
(i) Water-oriented commercial, industrial, and recreation uses should be given high priority in the High Intensity environment. First priority should be given to water-dependent uses. Second priority should be given to water-related and water-enjoyment
uses. Nonwater-oriented uses should not be allowed except as part of mixed-use developments or in areas of traditional non-water-oriented uses such as retail and similar uses in the Downtown. Nonwater-oriented uses may also be allowed in limited situations where they do not conflict with or limit opportunities for water-oriented uses or on sites where there is no direct access to the shoreline. Public benefits such as ecological restoration or public access may be required in association with nonwater-oriented development.
(ii) When considering shoreline environment designation amendment proposals, full utilization of existing high intensity areas should be achieved before further expansion of intensive development is allowed.
(iii) New development in the High Intensity designation should assure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Where applicable, new development should include environmental cleanup and restoration of the shoreline to comply with any relevant state and federal law.
(iv) Where feasible, visual and physical public access should be required as part of development in the High Intensity designation unless it already exists to serve the development or other safety, security, or fragile environmental conditions apply.
(v) Aesthetic objectives should be implemented by means such as sign control regulations, appropriate development siting, screening and architectural standards, and maintenance of natural vegetative separation.
(4) Aquatic.
(a) Purpose: The purpose of the Aquatic environment is to protect, restore, and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the ordinary high-water mark.
(b) Designation Criteria: Assign an Aquatic environment designation to lands waterward of the ordinary high-water mark.
(c) Management Policies:
(i) Allow new over-water structures only for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration.
(ii) The size of new over-water structures should be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure's intended use.
(iii) In order to reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources, multiple use of over-water facilities should be encouraged.
(iv) All developments and uses should be located and designed to consider impacts to public views, and to allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration.
(v) Shoreline uses and modifications should be designed and managed to prevent adverse impacts to ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes, including degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions. Adverse impacts should not be allowed except where necessary to achieve the objectives of the Shoreline Management Act, and then only when mitigated as necessary to assure no net loss of ecological functions.
(5) Environment Designation Interpretation.
(a) If disagreement develops as to the exact location of an environment designation boundary line, the Official Shoreline Maps shall prevail consistent with the following rules:
(i) Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot, tract, or section lines shall be so construed.
(ii) In cases where boundary line adjustments or subdivisions occur, the designation applied to the parent parcel prior to the boundary line adjustment or subdivision shall not
change as a result. The shoreline designation can be redesignated through an SMP amendment.
(iii) Boundaries indicated as approximately following roads and railroads shall be respectively construed to follow the nearest right-of-way edge.
(iv) Boundaries indicated as approximately parallel to or extensions of features indicated in (i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection shall be so construed.
(b) In the event of an environment designation mapping error where the SMP update or amendment record, including the public hearing process, is clear in terms of the correct environment designation to apply to a property, the SMP Administrator shall apply the environment designation approved through the SMP Update or Amendment process and correct the map. Appeals of such interpretations may be filed pursuant to Part III (Administration and Permitting) and the City’s appeal procedures in Section 16.39.170 (Appeals). Each appeal filed under Subsection 16.55.220(5)(b) shall be accompanied by a filing fee in such sum as the City Council may set by resolution. If the environment designation criteria were misapplied, but the map does not show an unintentional error (e.g. the SMP hearing and adoption record does not indicate another designation was intended), an SMP amendment may be obtained consistent with WAC 173-26-100 and Section 16.55.180 (Amendment of Shoreline Master Program).
(c) All shoreline areas waterward of the OHWM shall be designated Aquatic.
(d) All shoreline areas upland of the OHWM shall be designated Shoreline Residential, Shoreline Parks, or High Intensity.
(e) Only one environment designation shall apply to a given shoreland area. In the case of parallel designations, designations shall be divided along an identified linear feature and the boundary shall be clearly noted on the map.
(6) Pre-Designation of Urban Growth Area. The City of Pullman has adopted shoreline environment pre-designations for shorelines located outside of City limits, but within the City’s urban growth area. In the event of annexation of a shoreline, the affected area shall be subject to the Pullman Shoreline Master Program upon the effective date of the annexation.
(7) Official Shoreline Maps and Unmapped or Undesignated Shorelines.
(a) The Official Shoreline Maps at the time of SMP adoption, which illustrate the approximate shoreline jurisdiction and environment designations in the City, are available for review in the City Planning Department. The Official Shoreline Maps shall include the following language: “The City of Pullman certifies that this map, dated the 29th day of March, constitutes the Official Shoreline Map, as approved by Pullman City Council Ordinance No. 16-3 signed by the Mayor.” The Official Shoreline Maps may be updated administratively or through an SMP amendment as indicated in Subsections 16.55.220(7)(b) through 16.55.220(7)(d). The Department of Ecology will be provided with electronic files of the Official Shoreline Maps when any updates are made. Minor mapping errors corrected administratively shall not be greater than 1.0 acre in size. If greater than 1.0 acre in size, a SMP amendment shall be completed within three years of finding the mapping error.
(b) Any areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are not mapped and/or designated due to minor mapping inaccuracies in the lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction from the shoreline waterbody related to site-specific surveys of OHWM, floodway, and/or floodplain are automatically assigned the category of the contiguous waterward shoreline environment designation. Correction of these minor mapping inaccuracies may be made and incorporated into the Official Shoreline Maps without an SMP amendment.
(c) All other areas of shoreline jurisdiction that were neither mapped as jurisdiction nor assigned an environment designation shall be assigned a
Shoreline Parks designation until the shoreline can be redesignated through an SMP amendment process conducted consistent with WAC 173-26-100 and Section 16.55.180 (Amendment of Shoreline Master Program).
(d) The actual location of the OHWM, floodplain, floodway, and wetland boundaries must be determined at the time a development is proposed. Wetland boundary and OHWM determinations are valid for five years from the date the determination is made. Floodplain and floodway boundaries should be assessed using FEMA maps or the most current technical information available.
(8) Any property or portion thereof shown in shoreline jurisdiction that is later found based on the most current information available at the time of an application to not meet the criteria for shoreline jurisdiction shall not be subject to the requirements of this SMP. The Official Shoreline Map is based on information available at the time of adoption of this SMP, but this SMP recognizes that better information about the locations of the OHWM, floodway, or associated wetlands, for example, may be developed at the site-specific scale and site conditions may change over time. Revisions to the Official Shoreline Maps may be made as outlined in Subsection 16.55.220(7)(a) without an SMP amendment.
(Ord. 16-3 §23, 2016)
16.55.230 Introduction. General policies and regulations are applicable to all uses and activities that occur within all Shoreline Environment Designations. The policies and regulations found in this chapter are intended to be used in conjunction with the more specific use and activity regulations found in the following chapters. These policies apply to all uses within the jurisdiction, whether or not a separate shoreline permit is required. These policies may be used to condition any required permit or letter of exemption or statement of exemption.
(Ord. 16-3 §24, 2016)
16.55.240 Shoreline Use and Development Regulations.
(1) Policies.
(a) Give preference along the shoreline to water-oriented uses, while controlling pollution and preventing damage to the natural environment.
(b) Nonwater-oriented accessory development or use that does not require a shoreline location should be located landward of shoreline jurisdiction unless such development is required to serve approved water-oriented uses and/or developments.
(c) Encourage uses and development that enhance or increase public access to the shoreline or provide some public benefit.
(d) Protect current agricultural uses on agricultural land and provide for new agricultural uses so that they are located and designed to ensure no net loss of ecological functions and do not have a significant adverse impact on other shoreline resources and values.
(e) The design, density and location of all allowed uses and developments should reflect physical and natural features of the shoreline and should assure no net loss of ecological functions by avoiding and minimizing adverse effects on shoreline ecology.
(f) Site plans and structural designs for shoreline development should acknowledge the water’s proximity and value as an ecological and scenic resource. Development and uses should be designed in a manner that directs land alteration to the least sensitive portions of the site.
(2) Regulations.
(a) All uses in the shoreline shall comply with the City’s development code and this Program.
(b) The shoreline use and modification table (Table 16.55.320-1) defines those uses that are permitted, conditional, or prohibited. All uses and modifications that are not specifically listed in the table are “unclassified.” Unclassified uses shall be considered conditional uses and shall be governed by the policies in WAC 173-26.
(c) All structures in the shoreline shall be designed and constructed consistent with the underlying zoning and shall not exceed 35 feet above average grade level, consistent with RCW 90.58.
(d) To the extent feasible, shoreline developments shall locate the water-oriented portion of their
development along the shoreline and place all other facilities landward, or outside the shoreline jurisdiction in compliance with use preferences stated in RCW 90.58.020, WAC 173-26-241(2)(a)(iii) and 173-26-211(3)(b).
(e) In compliance with WAC 173-26-221(4)(d)(iv), where proposed development creates a conflict between water-dependent uses or physical public access and maintenance of views from adjacent properties, the water-dependent uses and physical public access shall have priority.
(f) The design, construction, and operation of permitted uses in the shorelines shall minimize interference with the public’s use of the water.
(Ord. 16-3 §25, 2016)
16.55.250 Environmental Protection.
(1) Policies.
(a) Protect all shorelines of the state in a manner consistent with all relevant constitutional and other legal limitations on the regulation of private property so that there is no net loss of ecological functions from both individual permitted or exempt development.
(b) Protect and, where necessary, apply planning and land use measures to improve the quality and productivity of the City's environmental resources (air, ground and surface waters, and indigenous biology).
(c) Sustain a diverse, productive, and high quality natural environment for the use, health and enjoyment of City residents.
(2) Regulations.
(a) Ecological Functions. Uses and developments on the City’s shoreline must be designed, located, sized, constructed and maintained to achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources. New uses and developments must not have an unmitigated adverse impact on other shoreline functions fostered by this SMP.
(b) Protection of Critical Areas and Buffers. Critical areas, critical areas buffers, and
shoreline buffers must be protected in accordance with the provisions of SMP Part VII (Shoreline Critical Areas Policies and Regulations).
(c) Mitigation Requirement. If a proposed shoreline use or development is entirely addressed by specific, objective standards (such as setback distances, pier dimensions, or materials requirements) contained in this SMP, then the mitigation sequencing analysis described in Subsection 16.55.250(2)(d) is not required. In the following circumstances, the applicant must provide a mitigation sequencing analysis as described in Subsection 16.55.250(2)(d):
(i) If a proposed shoreline use or development is addressed in any part by discretionary standards (such as standards requiring a particular action “if feasible” or requiring the minimization of development size) contained in this Chapter, then the mitigation sequencing analysis is required for the discretionary standard(s); or
(ii) When an action requires a Shoreline Conditional Use Permit or Shoreline Variance Permit; or
(iii) When specifically required by regulations contained in this SMP.
(d) Mitigation Sequence. In order to ensure that development activities contribute to meeting the no net loss provisions by avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating for adverse impacts to ecological functions or ecosystem-wide processes, an applicant required to complete a mitigation analysis pursuant to Subsection 16.55.250(2)(c) must describe how the proposal will follow the sequence of mitigation as defined below:
(i) Avoid the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
(ii) Minimize the impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;
(iii) Rectify the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
environment to the conditions existing at the time of the initiation of the project or activity;
(iv) Reduce or eliminate the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;
(v) Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and
(vi) Monitor the impact and the compensation projects and take appropriate corrective measures.
(e) Adverse Impacts. Example of common actions that may result in adverse ecological impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Removal of native plant communities in shoreline jurisdiction,
(ii) Removal of native or non-native trees that overhang the water,
(iii) Removal of native or non-native vegetation on slopes if that vegetation supports maintenance of slope stability and prevents surface erosion,
(iv) Removal or alteration of priority habitats or habitat for priority species,
(v) Construction of new or expanded in- and over-water structures,
(vi) Construction of new or expanded shoreline stabilizations,
(vii) New discharges of water into shoreline waters that may introduce pollutants,
(viii)Construction of new impervious surfaces whose discharges are not infiltrated and thus may alter hydrologic conditions of shoreline waterbodies, and/or
(ix) Changes in grading or fill that reduce floodplain capacity.
(f) Mitigation Plan. All proposed alterations to shoreline jurisdiction that may have adverse effects on ecological functions require mitigation sufficient to provide for and maintain
the functions and values of the shoreline area or to prevent risk from a critical areas hazard. The applicant must develop and implement a mitigation plan prepared by a qualified professional. Mitigation in excess of that necessary to ensure that development will result in no net loss of ecological functions will not be required by the City of Pullman, but may be voluntarily performed by an applicant. In addition to any requirements found in Part VII (Shoreline Critical Areas Policies and Regulations) a mitigation plan must include:
(i) An inventory and assessment of the existing shoreline environment including relevant physical, chemical and biological elements;
(ii) A discussion of any federal, state, or local management recommendations which have been developed for critical areas or other species or habitats located on the site;
(iii) A discussion of proposed measures which mitigate the adverse impacts of the project to ensure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions;
(iv) A discussion of proposed management practices which will protect fish and wildlife habitat both during construction, and after the project site has been fully developed;
(v) Scaled drawings of existing and proposed conditions, materials specifications, and a minimum three-year maintenance and monitoring plan, including performance standards;
(vi) A contingency plan if mitigation fails to meet established success criteria; and
(vii) Any additional information necessary to determine the adverse impacts of a proposal and mitigation of the impacts.
(g) Alternative Mitigation. When compensatory measures are appropriate pursuant to the mitigation priority sequence above, preferential consideration shall be given to measures that replace the impacted functions on site and in kind. To provide for flexibility in the
administration of the ecological protection provisions of this SMP, alternative mitigation approaches may be approved within shoreline jurisdiction where such approaches provide increased protection of shoreline ecological functions and processes over the standard provisions of this SMP and are scientifically supported, or are consistent with the Shoreline Restoration Plan or watershed-level management plans. Potential alternative mitigation tools include advance mitigation and mitigation banking. Authorization of alternative compensatory mitigation measures may require appropriate safeguards, terms or conditions as necessary to ensure no net loss of ecological functions, and may require approval by other state or federal agencies.
(Ord. 16-3 §26, 2016)
16.55.260 Shoreline Vegetation Conservation.
(1) Policies.
(a) Where new developments, uses and/or redevelopments are proposed, ensure shoreline vegetation, both upland and waterward of the OHWM, is conserved to maintain shoreline ecological functions and processes.
(b) Encourage management and control of noxious and invasive weeds. Control of such species should be done in a manner that retains onsite native vegetation, provides for erosion control, and protects water quality.
(2) Regulations.
(a) Vegetation conservation standards do not apply retroactively to existing legally established uses and developments. Vegetation associated with existing structures, uses and developments may be maintained within shoreline jurisdiction.
(b) Vegetation within shoreline buffers, other stream buffers, wetlands and wetland buffers, WDFW-mapped priority habitats and species areas, and other critical areas within shoreline jurisdiction must be managed consistent with Part VII (Shoreline Critical Areas Policies and Regulations). Regulations specifying establishment and management of shoreline buffers
are located in Section 16.55.400 (Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas).
(c) Other vegetation within shoreline jurisdiction, but outside of shoreline buffers, creek buffers, wetlands and wetland buffers, and other WDFW-mapped priority habitats and species areas must be managed according to Section 16.55.250 (Environmental Protection) and any other regulations specific to vegetation management contained in this SMP and Pullman City Code.
(d) Vegetation clearing must be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate approved shoreline development that is consistent with all other provisions of this SMP and Pullman City Code. Mitigation sequencing per Subsection 16.55.250(2)(d) must be applied unless specifically excluded by this SMP, so that the design and location of the structure or development, including septic drainfields, minimizes short- and long-term vegetation removal. The City may approve modifications or require minor site plan alterations to achieve maximum tree retention.
(e) Where vegetation removal conducted consistent with this Section results in adverse impacts to shoreline ecological function, new developments or site alterations are required to develop and implement a supplemental mitigation plan. Examples of actions that may result in adverse impacts include:
(i) Removal of native trees, shrubs or groundcovers;
(ii) Removal of non-native trees or shrubs that overhang aquatic areas or stabilize slopes or stream banks; or
(iii) Removal of native or non-native trees or shrubs that disrupts an existing vegetation corridor connecting the property to other critical areas or buffers.
Mitigation plans must be prepared by a qualified professional or under the supervision of a government agency or the Palouse Conservation District, and must contain information required in Subsection 16.55.250(2)(f). All mitigation
plantings shall be preferentially placed in the shoreline buffer, unless the trees provide connectivity to upland habitats or other critical areas. Mitigation measures must be maintained over the life of the use or development.
(f) Where a tree poses a safety hazard, it may be removed or converted to a wildlife snag if the hazard cannot be eliminated by pruning, crown thinning, or other technique that maintains some habitat function.
(g) Selective pruning of trees for views is allowed. Selective pruning of trees for views does not include removal of understory vegetation, and must not compromise the health of the tree.
(h) Invasive Species Control.
(i) Hand removal or spot-spraying of invasive species or noxious weeds included on the Washington State Noxious Weed List as a Class A, B or C weed on shorelands outside of steep or unstable slope areas is permitted.
(ii) Mechanical removal or large-scale (greater than 200 square feet) chemical treatment of invasive species.
(aa) Mechanical removal or large-scale chemical treatment of invasive species or noxious weeds included on the Washington State Noxious Weed List as a Class A, B or C weed on shorelands outside of steep or unstable slope areas is permitted.
(bb) Coordination with the applicable local conservation district is encouraged prior to undertaking invasive or noxious weed removal projects to ensure that the control and disposal technique is appropriate.
(cc) Where noxious weeds and invasive species removal results in bare soils that may be subject to erosion or recolonization by invasive or noxious species, the area must be stabilized using best management practices and replanted with native plants (in or
outside of shoreline or critical area buffers) or suitable non-native plants (outside of shoreline or critical area buffers). The replanted vegetation must be similar in size and structure at maturity to the removed vegetation.
(dd) Invasive species removal efforts that exceed one-quarter acre should be phased if feasible to minimize potential erosion and sedimentation impacts.
(iii) Aquatic weed control must only be permitted where the presence of aquatic weeds will adversely affect native plant communities, fish and wildlife habitats, or an existing water-dependent recreational use. Aquatic weed control efforts must comply with all applicable laws and standards.
(Ord. 16-3 §27, 2016)
16.55.270 Water Quality, Stormwater, and Nonpoint Pollution.
(1) Policies.
(a) Maintain and improve the water quality and quantity of the City’s shorelines, and preserve surface and groundwater for the beneficial use of the City’s citizens and wildlife over the long term.
(b) Prevent impacts to water quality and surface water quantity that would result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions, or a significant impact to aesthetic qualities or recreational opportunities.
(c) Encourage effective erosion and sedimentation controls for construction in shoreline areas.
(2) Regulations.
(a) Do not degrade ecological functions. Design, construction and operation of shoreline uses and developments shall incorporate all known, available, and reasonable methods of preventing, controlling, and treating stormwater to protect and maintain surface and ground water quantity and quality so that there is no net loss of ecological functions.
(b) Do not degrade views and recreation opportunities. Design, construction and operation of shoreline uses and developments shall incorporate measures to protect and maintain surface and groundwater quantity and quality in accordance with all applicable laws, so that significant impacts to aesthetic qualities (e.g., water color) or recreational opportunities (e.g., safe swimming and fishing) do not occur.
(c) Requirements for new development.
(i) New development and re-development shall manage short-term and long-term stormwater runoff to avoid and minimize potential adverse effects on shoreline ecological functions through compliance with the latest edition of the Stormwater Management Manual for Eastern Washington (2004) or approved equivalent. If certain thresholds are not met by a development that trigger compliance with the Stormwater Management Manual or approved equivalent, best management practices (BMPs) must still be employed to avoid and minimize potential adverse effects.
(ii) When the Stormwater Management Manual applies, deviations from the standards may be approved where it can be demonstrated that off-site facilities would provide better treatment, or where common retention, detention and/or water quality facilities meeting such standards have been approved as part of a comprehensive stormwater management plan.
(d) Sewage management. New developments or failing septic systems shall connect to an existing municipal sewer service system if feasible, or install a system or make system corrections approved by Whitman County Public Health Department.
(e) Materials requirements. All materials that may come in contact with water shall be untreated or approved treated wood, concrete, approved plastic composites, or steel that will not adversely affect water quality or aquatic plants or animals.
(f) Storage. The bulk storage of oil, fuel, chemicals, or hazardous materials, on either a temporary or a permanent basis, shall not occur in shoreline jurisdiction without adequate secondary containment and an emergency spill response plan in place.
(Ord. 16-3 §28, 2016)
16.55.280 Flood Hazard Management.
(1) Policies.
(a) Recognize and protect the hydrologic functions of floodplains by limiting the use of structural flood hazard reduction measures except where they are necessary to protect existing development and where non-structural flood hazard reduction measures are infeasible.
(b) Ensure developments subject to damage or that could result in loss of life do not locate in areas of known flood hazards unless it can be demonstrated by the project proponent that the development is sited, designed and engineered for long-term structural integrity, and that life and property on and off-site are not subject to increased hazards as a result of the development.
(c) Limit new development or uses in shoreline jurisdiction, including subdivision of land, that would likely require structural flood hazard reduction measures.
(2) Regulations.
(a) Development in floodplains shall avoid significantly or cumulatively increasing flood hazards. Development shall be consistent with this SMP, including Section 16.55.250 (Environmental Protection) and Section 16.55.380 (Frequently Flooded Areas) as well as applicable guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and an approved flood hazard management plan.
(b) The channel migration zone (CMZ) is considered to be that area of a stream channel which may erode as a result of normal and naturally occurring processes and has been mapped consistent with WAC 173-26-221(3)(b). The Channel Migration Zone Maps are available for review in the City Planning
Department. Applicants for shoreline development or modification may submit a site-specific CMZ study if they believe these conditions do not exist on the subject property and the map is in error. The CMZ study must be prepared consistent with WAC 173-26-221(3)(b), and may include, but is not limited to, historic aerial photographs, topographic mapping, flooding records, and field verification. The CMZ study must be prepared by a licensed geologist or engineer with at least five years of applied experience in assessing fluvial geomorphic processes and channel response.
(c) The following uses and activities may be authorized within the CMZ or floodway, provided they are also consistent with Section 16.55.380 (Frequently Flooded Areas):
(i) Actions that protect or restore the ecosystem-wide processes or ecological functions or development with a primary purpose of protecting or restoring ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes.
(ii) New development or redevelopment landward of existing legal structures, such as levees, that prevent active channel movement and flooding.
(iii) Existing and ongoing agricultural activities provided that no new restrictions to channel movement are proposed.
(iv) Development of new or expansion or redevelopment of existing bridges, utility lines, public stormwater facilities and outfalls, and other public utility and transportation structures, including trails, where no other feasible alternative exists or the alternative would result in unreasonable and disproportionate costs. (For the purposes of this Section, “unreasonable and disproportionate” means that locations outside of the floodway or CMZ would add more than 20% to the total project cost. Other methods to determine unreasonable and disproportionate cost may be used on a case-by-case basis with approval of the SMP Administrator. [20% has
been used as a threshold by WSDOT and the Federal Department of Justice for ADA standards]) Where such structures are allowed, mitigation shall address adversely impacted functions and processes in the affected shoreline.
(v) New or redeveloped measures to reduce shoreline erosion, provided that it is demonstrated that the erosion rate exceeds that which would normally occur in a natural condition, that the measures do not interfere with fluvial hydrological and geo-morphological processes normally acting in natural conditions, and that the measures include appropriate mitigation of adverse impacts on ecological functions associated with the river or stream.
(vi) Water-dependent installations which by their very nature must be in the floodway.
(vii) Modifications or additions to an existing nonagricultural legal use, provided that channel migration is not further limited and that the modified or expanded development includes appropriate protection of ecological functions.
(viii)Repair and maintenance of existing legally established use and developments, provided that channel migration is not further limited, flood hazards to other uses are not increased, and significant adverse ecological impacts are avoided.
(ix) Uses and developments allowed in the floodway under Section 16.55.380 (Frequently Flooded Areas) provided they are otherwise consistent with all provisions of Part VII (Shoreline Critical Areas Policies and Regulations) and other requirements of this SMP.
(d) Flood hazard reduction measures shall not result in channelization of normal stream flows, interfere with natural hydraulic processes such as channel migration, or undermine existing structures or downstream banks.
(e) New development in shoreline jurisdiction, including the subdivision of land, shall not be permitted if it is reasonably foreseeable that the development or use would require structural flood hazard reduction measures within the channel migration zone or floodway.
(f) New public and private structural flood hazard reduction measures:
(i) Shall not be approved, unless a scientific and engineering analysis demonstrates the following:
(aa) That they are necessary to protect existing development;
(bb) That nonstructural measures, such as buffers and setbacks, land use controls, wetland restoration, dike removal, use or structure removal or relocation, biotechnical measures, and stormwater management programs are not feasible;
(cc) That adverse effects upon adjacent properties will not result relative to increased floodwater depths and velocities during the base flood or other more frequent flood occurrences;
(dd) That the ability of natural drainage ways to adequately drain floodwaters after a flooding event is not impaired;
(ee) That the proposal has been coordinated through the appropriate diking district where applicable, and that potential adverse effects upon other affected diking districts have been documented; and,
(ff) That adverse impacts on ecological functions and priority species and habitats can be successfully mitigated so as to assure no net loss.
(ii) Shall be consistent with an approved comprehensive flood hazard management plan.
(iii) Shall be placed landward of associated wetlands and designated shoreline buffers, except for actions that increase ecological
functions, such as wetland restoration, or when no other alternative location to reduce flood hazard to existing development is feasible as determined by the SMP Administrator.
(g) New public structural flood hazard reduction measures, such as levees, shall dedicate and improve public access pathways unless public access improvements would cause unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public, inherent and unavoidable security problems, unacceptable and unmitigable significant adverse ecological impacts, unavoidable conflict with the proposed use, or a cost that is disproportionate and unreasonable to the total long-term cost of the development.
(h) In those instances where management of vegetation as required by this SMP conflicts with vegetation provisions included in state, federal or other flood hazard agency documents governing City-authorized, legal flood hazard reduction measures, the vegetation requirements of this SMP will not apply. However, the applicant shall submit documentation of these conflicting provisions with any shoreline permit applications, and shall comply with all other provisions of this Section and this SMP that are not strictly prohibited by the approving flood hazard agency.
(i) The removal of gravel or other riverbed material for flood management purposes shall be consistent with Section 16.55.530 (Dredging and Dredge Material Disposal) and be allowed only after a biological and geo-morphological study shows that extraction has a long-term benefit to flood hazard reduction, does not result in a net loss of ecological functions, and is part of a comprehensive flood management solution.

1 The determination of whether a permitted use requires a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit or is exempt from a permit depends on whether the specific proposal meets the criteria for a shoreline exemption as identified in Subsection 16.55.160(3) and WAC 173-27-040. This determination is made by the Shoreline Administrator as outlined in Subsection 16.55.120(1).
2 Note: Sites “separated from shoreline” are those sites physically separated from the shoreline by another property or public right of way.
3 Any disposal of dredge material within a channel migration zone requires a Shoreline Conditional Use Permit. A SCUP is not required for discharges of dredge material into the flowing current of a river or in deep water within the channel where it does not substantially affect the geo-hydrologic character of the channel migration zone.
4 Parking as a primary use is prohibited in all designations per WAC 173-26-241(3)(k)).
(Ord. 16-3 §33, 2016)
16.55.330 Shoreline Development Standards.
(1) Minimum Standards. To preserve the existing and planned character of the shoreline consistent with the purposes of the shoreline environment designations, development standards are provided in Table 16.55.330-1. In addition, shoreline developments shall comply with all other dimensional requirements of the Pullman City Code.
(2) Departures from Standards. When a development or use is proposed that does not comply with the dimensional performance standards of this SMP, such development or use can only be authorized by approval of a Shoreline Variance.

b. Demonstrates that the proposal will not obstruct the view of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining such shorelines or impair views from public lands or impair designated scenic vistas.
(Ord. 16-3 §34, 2016)
16.55.340 Policies.
(1) Identify and protect critical fish and wildlife habitat from destruction or encroachment of incompatible uses.
(2) Preserve natural wetlands that are important wildlife and game habitat or recreational areas.
(3) Protect life and property by avoiding inappropriate developments in areas susceptible to natural disasters and hazards, such as floodplains and steep slopes.
(Ord. 16-3 §35, 2016)
16.55.350 General Regulations.
(1) Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this Chapter is to designate and classify ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas within shoreline jurisdiction and to protect these areas and their functions and values, while also allowing for reasonable use of private property.
(b) This Chapter is established to implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the City of Pullman Comprehensive Plan, the Shoreline Management Act, and the Growth Management Act.
(c) The City finds that critical areas provide a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the City and its residents, and/or may pose a threat to human safety or to public and private property. The beneficial functions and values provided by critical areas include, but are not limited to, water quality protection and enhancement; fish and wildlife habitat; food chain support; flood storage; conveyance and attenuation; ground water recharge and discharge; erosion control; wave attenuation; protection from hazards; historical, archaeological, and aesthetic value protection; and recreation. These beneficial functions are not listed in order of priority.
(d) By identifying development impacts to critical areas, this Chapter seeks to:
(i) Protect members of the public, public resources, and facilities from injury, loss of life, or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures, erosion, seismic events, volcanic eruptions, or flooding;
(ii) Protect unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, and fish and wildlife and their habitats;
(iii) Direct activities not dependent on critical area resources to less ecologically
sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas; and,
(iv) Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat, and the overall net loss of wetlands, frequently flooded areas and habitat conservation areas.
(e) This Chapter is intended to protect critical areas in accordance with the Shoreline Management Act and through the application of the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available, and in consultation with state and federal agencies and other qualified professionals.
(f) This Chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this Chapter to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable economic use of property.
(g) The City’s enactment or enforcement of this Chapter shall not be construed for the benefit of any individual person or group of persons other than the general public.
(2) Authority and Applicability.
(a) The SMP Administrator is given the authority to administer and enforce the provisions of this Chapter to accomplish the stated purpose.
(b) The City shall not approve any shoreline development permit or subdivision, or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation, or to construct or alter any structure or improvement in, over, or on a critical area or associated buffer, without first assuring compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
(c) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all lands, all land uses and development activity, and all structures and facilities in the City’s shoreline jurisdiction, whether or not a development permit or other authorization is required and shall apply to every person, firm,
partnership, corporation, group, governmental agency, or other entity that owns, leases, or administers land within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction. No person, company, agency, or applicant shall alter a critical area or buffer in shoreline jurisdiction except as consistent with the purposes and requirements of this Chapter.
(d) Approval of a development permit pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
(3) Relationship to Other Regulations.
(a) These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay to the City’s zoning code (Title 17) and other applicable regulations adopted by the City, including but not limited to design standards, building code, and State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) procedures.
(b) These critical area regulations shall apply concurrently with review conducted under SEPA, as locally adopted.
(c) Any individual critical area adjoined by another type of critical area shall meet the requirements that provide the most protection to the critical areas involved. When any provision of this Chapter or any existing regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflicts with this Chapter, that which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply.
(d) Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, HPA permits, Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this Chapter. Where applicable the SMP Administrator will encourage use of information such as permit applications to other agencies or special studies prepared in response to other regulatory requirements to support required documentation submitted for critical areas review.
(4) Appeals. Any aggrieved party may appeal final decisions of the SMP Administrator regarding critical area reports required under Subsections 16.55.350(10), 16.55.360(4), and 16.55.400(2). An appeal of such decisions shall be heard by the Hearing Examiner in accordance with the procedures set forth in Sections 16.55.120 (Administrative Authority and Responsibility), 16.55.130 (Administration), and 16.39.170 (Appeals). Each appeal filed under Subsection 16.55.350(4) shall be accompanied by a filing fee in such sum as the City Council may set by resolution.
(5) Interpretation. The SMP Administrator may, acting on his or her own initiative or in response to an inquiry, issue interpretations of any provision of this Chapter. The SMP Administrator shall base his or her interpretations on the defined or common meaning of the words of the provision and the general purpose of the provision. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, the provisions of this Chapter shall be considered to be the minimum requirements necessary, shall be liberally construed to serve the purpose of this ordinance, and shall be deemed to neither limit nor repeal any other provisions under state statute.
(6) Jurisdiction.
(a) The City shall regulate all uses, activities, and developments within, adjacent to, or likely to affect, one or more critical areas within shoreline jurisdiction, consistent with the most current, accurate, and complete scientific information available, and the provisions contained within this Chapter.
(b) Critical areas regulated by this Chapter include:
(i) Wetlands (16.55.360);
(ii) Critical aquifer recharge areas (16.55.370);
(iii) Frequently flooded areas (16.55.380);
(iv) Geologically hazardous areas (16.55.390); and
(v) Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas (16.55.400).
(c) All areas within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction meeting the definition of one or
more critical areas, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
(7) Protection of Critical Areas. Any action taken pursuant to this Chapter shall result in equivalent or greater functions and values of the critical areas associated with the proposed action, as determined by the most current, accurate, and complete scientific information available. All actions and developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the mitigation sequencing requirements in Subsection 16.55.250(2)(d) to avoid, minimize and restore all adverse impacts. Applicants must first demonstrate an inability to avoid or reduce impacts before restoration and compensation of impacts will be allowed. No activity or use shall be allowed that results in a net loss of the functions or values of critical areas.
(8) Allowed Activities.
(a) Process. The SMP Administrator shall allow activities that are verified to comply with this Chapter, provided the appropriate Shoreline Permit or Letter/Statement of Exemption is obtained, if required. Documentation of allowed activities shall be maintained on file at the department.
(b) Allowed Activities Shall Avoid Impacts to Critical Areas. All allowed activities shall use reasonable methods to avoid potential impacts to critical areas, using best management practices that result in the least amount of impact to the critical areas where practicable. Designation as an allowed activity does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Best management practices shall be used for tree and vegetation protection, construction management, erosion and sedimentation control, water quality protection, and regulation of chemical applications. The City shall observe the use of best management practices to ensure that the activity does not result in degradation to the critical area. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of
the exempted activity shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense.
(c) The following activities shall be allowed in critical areas and their buffers without a critical areas report, provided they are otherwise consistent with applicable local, state, and federal laws; they are conducted using best management practices and at a time and in a manner designed to minimize adverse impacts to the critical area. If a proposed or unauthorized activity does not meet the qualifications specified for that activity in this Subsection, it shall be addressed through the general regulations set forth in Subsection 16.55.350(9) or the enforcement provisions set forth in Section 16.55.140, as applicable. Allowed activities are as follows:
(i) Emergencies. Emergency activities are those activities necessary to prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or those that pose an immediate risk of damage to private property and that require remedial or preventative action in a time frame too short to allow for compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. Emergency actions in shoreline jurisdiction that create an impact to a critical area or its buffer shall use reasonable methods to address the emergency; in addition, they must have the least possible impact to the critical area or its buffer. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the SMP Administrator within one working day following commencement of the emergency activity. Within 30 days, the SMP Administrator shall determine if the action taken was within the scope of the emergency actions allowed in this Paragraph. If the SMP Administrator determines that the action taken, or any part of the action taken, was beyond the scope of an allowed emergency action, then provisions of Section 16.55.140 (Enforcement, Violations and Penalties) and 16.55.350(17) (Unauthorized Critical Area Alterations and Enforcement) shall apply.
After the emergency, the person or agency undertaking the action shall fully restore and/or mitigate any impacts to the critical area and buffers resulting from the emergency action in accordance with the critical area report and mitigation plan. The person or agency undertaking the action shall apply for review, and the critical area report and mitigation plan shall be reviewed by the SMP Administrator in accordance with the review procedures contained herein. Restoration and/or mitigation activities must be initiated within one year of the date of the emergency, and completed in a timely manner;
(ii) Operation, Maintenance or Repair. Operation, normal and routine maintenance or repair of existing structures, infrastructure improvements, utilities, public or private roads, dikes, levees or drainage systems that do not require a development permit, if the activity does not further alter or increase the impact to, or encroach further within, the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed operation, maintenance, or repair;
(iii) Passive Outdoor Activities. Recreation, education, and scientific research activities that do not degrade the critical area, including fishing, hiking, and bird watching;
(iv) Permit Requests Subsequent to Previous Critical Area Review. Development permits that involve both discretionary land use approvals (such as subdivisions, rezones, or conditional use permits), and construction approvals (such as building permits) if all of the following conditions have been met:
(aa) the provisions of this Chapter have been previously addressed as part of another approval;
(bb) there have been no material changes in the potential impact to the critical area or buffer since the prior review;
(cc) there is no new information available that is applicable to any critical area review of the site or particular critical area;
(dd) the permit or approval has not expired or, if no expiration date, no more than five years has elapsed since the issuance of that permit of approval; and
(ee) compliance with any standards or conditions placed upon the prior permit or approval has been achieved or secured;
(v) Modification to Existing Structures. Structural modification of, addition to, or replacement of an existing legally constructed structure that does not further alter or increase the impact to the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed modification or replacement, provided that restoration of structures substantially damaged by fire, flood, or act of nature must be initiated within one year of the date of such damage, as evidenced by the issuance of a valid building permit, and diligently pursued to completion;
(vi) Activities within the Improved Right-of Way. Replacement, modification, installation, or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes, mains, equipment, or appurtenances, not including substations, when such facilities are located within the improved portion of the public right-of-way or a City authorized private roadway, except those activities that alter a wetland or watercourse (such as culverts or bridges) or result in the transport of sediment or increased stormwater;
(vii) Planting of Vegetation. Planting of vegetation within a critical area or its buffer, provided a landscaping plan for this activity has been approved by the City;
(viii)Conservation Activities. Conservation, restoration, or preservation of soil, water,
vegetation, fish, and other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing critical area;
(ix) Pedestrian/Bicycle Trails. Pedestrian/bicycle trails that are located in buffer areas but not within wetlands or habitat conservation areas, where the trail surface meets all other requirements including water quality standards set forth in the City’s Design Standards;
(x) Select Vegetation Removal Activities. Select vegetation removal activities are allowed. Accepted vegetation removal activities include: a) removing and controlling invasive or noxious weeds; b) harvesting wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, or alteration of the critical area by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources; c) removing trees that are hazardous, posing a threat to public safety, or posing an imminent risk of damage to private property; or d) removing vegetation to control a fire or halt the spread of disease or damaging insects consistent with the State Forest Practices Act (Chapter 76.09 RCW). Unless otherwise provided or as a necessary part of an approved alteration, removal of any vegetation or woody debris from a habitat conservation area or wetland shall be prohibited;
(xi) Chemical Applications. The application of herbicides, pesticides, organic or mineral-derived fertilizers, or other hazardous substances, if necessary, provided that their use shall be conducted in accordance with applicable state and federal law;
(xii) Minor Site Investigative Work. Work necessary for land use submittals, such as surveys, soil logs, percolation tests, and other related activities, where such activities do not require construction of new roads or significant amounts of

(c) Innovative mitigation projects as described in this Section may, at the discretion of the SMP Administrator, be exempted from the timing requirements set forth in Subsection 16.55.350(11)(c).
(15) Critical Area Markers and Signs. The critical area or buffer shall be identified with temporary signs prior to any site alteration. Such temporary signs may be replaced with permanent signs, as determined appropriate by the SMP Administrator. The Administrator may also require that fencing be installed or native vegetation be planted or retained at a site to delineate and protect critical areas and/or their buffers.
(16) Building Setbacks. Unless otherwise provided by means of an approved critical area report or the provisions of this Chapter, buildings and other structures shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the edges of all critical area buffers or from the edges of all critical areas, if no buffers are required. The following may be allowed in the building setback area:
(a) Landscaping;
(b) Uncovered decks;
(c) Building overhangs if such overhangs do not extend more than two feet into the setback area; and
(d) Impervious ground surfaces, such as driveways, parking areas, and patios, provided that such improvements are constructed in accordance with the City’s Design Standards.
(17) Unauthorized Critical Area Alterations and Enforcement.
(a) Unauthorized Alteration. When a critical area or its buffer has been altered in violation of this Chapter, the City shall have the authority to issue a stop work order to cease all ongoing development work, and order restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or, where determined appropriate by the SMP Administrator, mitigation measures at the owner's or other responsible party's expense to compensate for violation of provisions of this Chapter and other applicable Pullman City Code provisions governing the applicable development permit.
(b) Restoration/Mitigation Plan Required. All development work shall remain stopped until a restoration/mitigation plan is prepared and approved by the SMP Administrator. Such a plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional and
shall describe how the actions proposed meet the minimum standards described in Subsection 16.55.350(17)(c) and/or mitigation requirements outlined in Subsections 16.55.350(11) through 16.55.350(13), if mitigation is determined to be appropriate by the SMP Administrator. The Administrator shall, at the violator’s expense, seek expert advice in determining the adequacy of the plan. Inadequate plans shall be returned to the applicant or violator for revision and resubmittal.
(c) Minimum Standards for Restoration or Mitigation.
(i) For alterations to critical aquifer recharge areas, frequently flooded areas, wetlands, and habitat conservation areas, the following minimum standards shall be met for the restoration or mitigation of impacts to a critical area, provided that if the violator can demonstrate in a restoration/mitigation plan that greater functional and habitat values can be obtained, these standards may be modified by the SMP Administrator:
(aa) The historic structural and functional values shall be restored, including water quality and habitat functions;
(bb) The historic soil types and configuration shall be replicated;
(cc) The critical area and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation that replicates the vegetation historically found on the site in species types, sizes, and densities; and
(dd) The historic functions and values should be replicated at the location of the alteration.
(ii) For alterations to flood and geological hazards, the following minimum standards shall be met for the restoration of a critical area, provided that, if the violator can demonstrate that greater safety can be obtained, these standards may be modified:
(aa) The hazard shall be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, the pre-development hazard;

(cc) The hazard area and buffers shall be replanted with native vegetation sufficient to minimize the hazard.
(d) Penalties. Any violation or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter, or any amendment thereto, shall be a civil infraction and shall be subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed $500.00 for each violation. Each day in which a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. Any activity carried out contrary to the provisions of this Chapter shall constitute a public nuisance and may be enjoined as provided by the statutes of the state of Washington. Daily fines shall not be levied until after a violator has received a written notice of the violation and shall not be levied while a written notice of violation is under appeal through the applicable appeal process.
(18) Financial Guarantees to Ensure Mitigation and Maintenance
(a) Mitigation required pursuant to a development proposal should be completed prior to final project approval. When the SMP Administrator determines it is not feasible for required mitigation to be completed prior to final project approval, the SMP Administrator shall require the applicant to post a financial guarantee in a form and amount deemed acceptable by the SMP Administrator. Acceptable financial guarantees include, but are not limited to, cash, bond, promissory note, or letter of credit.
(b) Once mitigation measures have been completed, the SMP Administrator may require a financial guarantee for maintenance of said mitigation measures.
(c) The financial guarantee shall be in the amount of one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of the improvements or the
estimated cost of restoring the functions and values of the critical area that are at risk, whichever is greater.
(d) The financial guarantee shall remain in effect until the SMP Administrator determines, in writing, that the standards bonded for have been met. Financial guarantees for maintenance shall be held by the City for a minimum of five years to ensure that the required mitigation has been fully implemented and demonstrated to function, and may be held for longer periods when necessary.
(e) Depletion, failure, or collection of financial guarantee funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.
(f) Public development proposals shall be relieved from having to comply with the requirements of this Section if public funds have previously been committed for mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.
(g) Any failure to satisfy critical area requirements established by law or condition including, but not limited to, the failure to provide a monitoring report within 30 days after it is due or the failure to comply with other provisions of a mitigation plan may be deemed by the SMP Administrator to constitute a default, and the SMP Administrator may demand payment of any financial guarantees or require other action authorized by the Pullman City Code or any other law.
(h) Any funds recovered pursuant to this Section shall be used to complete the required mitigation.
(19) Critical Area Inspections. Reasonable access to the site shall be provided to the City, state, and federal agency review staff for the purposes of inspections during any proposal review, restoration, emergency action, or monitoring period. Additionally, the City or its agent shall have reasonable access to the site for completing necessary remediation work in the event of noncompliance. Failure to provide access shall be
deemed a violation and shall be subject to the penalties set forth in Subsection 16.55.350(17)(d).
(Ord. 16-3 §36, 2016)
16.55.360 Wetlands.
(1) Delineation. Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this Chapter shall be determined by a qualified professional in accordance with the most current approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. All areas within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Section, regardless of any formal identification.
(2) Rating.
(a) Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Department of Ecology wetland rating system found in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Eastern Washington (Ecology Publication #14-06-030, or as amended and approved by Ecology). This document contains definitions and methods for determining if the general criteria below are met.
(i) Category I wetlands are: 1) alkali wetlands; 2) wetlands with high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR; 3) bogs and calcareous fens; 4) mature and old-growth forested wetlands over one-quarter acre with slow-growing trees; 5) forests with stands of aspen; and 6) wetlands that perform many functions very well (scores between 22-27 points). These wetlands are those that 1) present a unique or rare wetland type; or 2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or 3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or 4) provide a high level of function.
(ii) Category II wetlands are: 1) forested wetlands in the floodplains of rivers; 2) mature and old-growth forested wetlands over
one-quarter acre with fast-growing trees; 3) vernal pools; and 4) wetlands that perform functions well (scores between 19-21 points). These wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but still need a relatively high level of protection.
(iii) Category III wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scores between 16-18 points). Wetlands scoring between 16-18 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.
(iv) Category IV wetlands have the lowest level of functions (scores fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands should be able to be replaced, and in some cases be able to be improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions and also need to be protected.
(b) Date of Wetland Rating. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the local government, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications.
(3) Mapping. The approximate location and extent of known wetlands are shown on the pertinent City critical area map. National Wetland Inventory Maps and the City critical area map regarding wetlands are to be used as a guide for the City, project applicants, and property owners, and will be periodically updated as new information becomes available. These maps are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation. The exact location of a wetland's boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a qualified professional
applying delineation methods described in Subsection 16.55.360(1). Wetland boundaries shall be clearly demarcated with non-degradable survey flagging labeled “WETLAND BOUNDARY” or “WETLAND DELINEATION.” Flagging shall be attached to existing vegetation or stakes at a maximum interval of 50 linear feet. Individual flags should be labeled with a wetland identifier and consecutive numbers (e.g., A-1 through A-8).
(4) Critical Area Report- Additional Requirements.
(a) Areas Addressed in Report. The following areas shall be addressed in a critical area report for wetlands:
(i) The project area of the proposed activity;
(ii) All wetlands and recommended buffers within 200 feet of the project area; and
(iii) All shoreline areas, water features, flood plains, and other critical areas, and related buffers within 200 feet of the project area.
(b) Wetland Analysis. In addition to the minimum required contents of critical area reports in Subsection 16.55.350(10), a critical area report for wetlands shall contain an analysis of the wetlands including the following site- and proposal-related information at a minimum:
(i) A written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers within 200 feet of the project area, including the following information at a minimum:
(aa) Wetland delineation and required buffers;
(bb) Existing wetland acreage;
(cc) Wetland category; vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics; and
(dd) Soil substrate conditions
(ii) A discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing wetlands and restore any wetlands that were degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity.
(iii) Proposed mitigation, if needed, including a written assessment and accompanying maps of the mitigation area, including the following information at a minimum:
(aa) Existing wetland acreage and proposed impact area;
(bb) Vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic conditions;
(cc) Relationship within watershed and to existing waterbodies;
(dd) Soil and substrate conditions, topographic elevations;
(ee) Existing and proposed adjacent site conditions;
(ff) Proposed wetland buffers;
(gg) Property ownership; and
(iv) A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect wetlands after the project site has been developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs.
(c) Additional Information. When appropriate, the SMP Administrator may also require the critical area report to include an evaluation by the Department of Ecology or an independent qualified expert regarding the applicant's analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, and to include any recommendations as appropriate.
(5) General Requirements.
(a) Activities in Wetland Areas. A proposed activity may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the activity, including associated mitigation measures, will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas.
(b) Wetland Buffers. Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter, wetland buffers are required.
(i) Standard Buffer Widths. The standard buffer widths presume the existence of a relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland
functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If the vegetation is inadequate then the buffer width shall be increased or the buffer should be planted to maintain the standard width.
(ii) Required standard wetland buffers, based on wetland category and land use intensity, are as follows:

? Forestry (cutting of trees only)
? Low-intensity open space (hiking, bird-watching, preservation of natural resources, etc.)
? Unpaved trails
? Utility corridor without a maintenance road and little or no vegetation management.
(c) Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category and the proposed land use. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.
(d) Increased Wetland Buffer Width. The SMP Administrator may require increased buffer width in accordance with the critical area report and the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values based on site- specific characteristics. This determination shall be based on one or more of the following criteria:
(i) A larger buffer is needed to protect other critical areas;
(ii) The buffer or adjacent uplands has an overall slope steeper than fifteen percent (15%) or is susceptible to erosion;
(iii) And standard erosion control measures will not prevent adverse impacts to the wetland; or
(iv) The buffer area has minimal vegetative cover, although implementation of a buffer planting plan may substitute for increasing the buffer width.
In no case shall wetland buffers be increased to a width two times that of the standard required buffer.
(e) Wetland Buffer Width Averaging. The SMP Administrator may allow modification of the standard wetland buffer width in accordance with the critical area report and the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available on a case-by-case basis by averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates that:
(i) It will not reduce wetland functions or values;
(ii) The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;
(iii) The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and
(iv) The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either seventy-five percent (75%) of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.
(f) Buffers for Mitigation Shall be Consistent. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this Chapter.
(g) Buffer Conditions Shall be Maintained. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this Chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in their natural condition.
(h) Functionally Isolated Buffer Areas. Areas that are functionally separated from a wetland and do not provide protection to the wetland from potential adverse impacts due to preexisting roads, facilities, or vertical separation, shall be excluded from buffers otherwise required by this chapter.
(i) Allowed Buffer Uses. In addition to those uses identified in Subsection 16.55.350(8)(c), the following uses may be allowed within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this Chapter, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:
(i) Passive recreation facilities. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical area report, including:
(aa) Walkways and trails, provided that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer twenty-five percent (25%) of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five (5) feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing non-treated pilings may be acceptable.
(bb) Wildlife-viewing structures.
(ii) Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a buffer, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer boundary, provided that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column is disturbed.
(iii) Enhancement of a wetland buffer through the removal of non-native invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of.
Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species.
(iv) Stormwater management facilities. Stormwater management facilities are limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales. They may be allowed within the outer twenty-five percent (25%) of the buffer of Category III or IV wetlands only, provided that:
(aa) No other location is feasible; and
(bb) The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland; and
(cc) Stormwater management facilities are not allowed in buffers of Category I or II wetlands.
(v) Non-Conforming Uses. Repair and maintenance of non-conforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided they do not increase the degree of nonconformity.
(j) Subdivisions. The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers is subject to the following:
(i) Land that is located wholly within a wetland or its buffer may not be subdivided.
(ii) Land that is located partially within a wetland or its buffer may be divided provided that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot:
(aa) Is located outside of the wetland and its buffer; and
(bb) Meets the minimum lot size requirements of the City zoning code (Title 17).
(iii) Access roads and utilities serving a proposed subdivision or other property may
be permitted within the wetland and associated buffers only if the SMP Administrator determines that no other feasible alternative exists and these facilities are otherwise established consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.
(k) Signs and Fencing of Wetlands.
(i) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved development permit shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.
(ii) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any development permit, the SMP Administrator may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland and/or buffer. If required, permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 linear feet, whichever yields the greater amount of signs, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the SMP Administrator:
“Protected Wetland Area Do Not Disturb
Contact City of Pullman Regarding Uses and Restrictions”
(iii) Fencing.
(aa) As a condition of any development permit, the SMP Administrator may require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland.
(bb) The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site.
(cc) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this Paragraph shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat.
(dd) At no time shall treated wood posts (e.g., creosote) be allowed in wetland areas or in adjacent uplands to prevent chemicals from migrating into the wetland.
(6) Compensatory Mitigation.
(a) Projects that propose compensation for wetland acreage and/or functions are subject to State and Federal regulations. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall provide for no net loss of wetland functions and values. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with the mitigation plan requirements of 16.55.350(13); Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans--Version 1, (Ecology Publication #06-06-011b, Olympia, WA, March 2006 or as amended); and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Eastern Washington) (Publication #10-06-07, November 2010).
(b) Mitigation for Lost Functions and Values. Mitigation actions shall address functions affected by the alteration to achieve functional equivalency or improvement, and shall provide similar wetland functions as those lost except when:
(i) The lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a site-specific function
assessment and the proposed mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal watershed assessment protocol; or
(ii) Out-of-kind replacement will best meet formally identified regional goals, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.
(c) Preference of Mitigation Actions. Mitigation actions that require compensation by replacing, enhancing, or substitution, shall occur in the following order of preference:
(i) Restoring wetlands on upland sites that were formerly wetlands;
(ii) Creating wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of exotic introduced species;
(iii) Enhancing significantly degraded wetlands;
(iv) Preserving high-quality wetlands that are under imminent threat.
(d) Location of Mitigation.
(i) Mitigation actions shall be conducted on the same site as the alteration except when the following apply:
(aa) There are no reasonable on-site opportunities or on-site opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success due to development pressures, adjacent land uses, or on-site buffers or connectivity are inadequate;
(bb) Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland.
(ii) If the SMP Administrator authorizes off-site mitigation, the location of this mitigation shall be in the same drainage basin and the same Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) as the site of the alteration unless:
(aa) Established regional or watershed goals for water quality, flood or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or
(bb) Credits from a state certified wetland mitigation bank are used as mitigation and the use of these credits justifies location of mitigation at another site.
(iii) Off-site locations for mitigation should be within the City limits if feasible opportunities for appropriate mitigation are available.
(e) Mitigation Ratios.
(i) Wetland mitigation ratios shall be consistent with Table 16.55.360-3.
Table 16.55.360-3. Wetland Mitigation Ratios Category and Type of Wetland Creation or Re-establishment Rehabilitation Enhancement
Category I: Bog, Wetlands with High Conservation Value

(ii) To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios in Table 16.55.360-3, the SMP Administrator may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in “Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Eastern Washington: Final Report” (Ecology
Publication #11-06-015, August 2012, or as amended).
(iii) Impacts to wetland buffers shall be mitigated at a 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development.
(f) Wetland Mitigation Banks.
(i) Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for uses as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:
(aa) The bank is certified through applicable provisions administered by the Department of Ecology and the Army Corps of Engineers;
(bb) The SMP Administrator determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and
(cc) The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank’s certification.
(ii) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank’s certification.
(iii) Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank’s certification. In some cases, bank service areas may include portions of more than one WRIA for specific wetland functions.
(g) Advance Mitigation. Mitigation for projects with pre-identified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to federal rules, State policy on advance mitigation, and State water quality regulations.
(h) Monitoring. Mitigation monitoring shall be required for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years. If a scrub-shrub or forested vegetation community is proposed,
monitoring may be required for ten years or more. The project mitigation plan shall include monitoring elements that ensure certainty of success for the project’s natural resource values and functions. If the mitigation goals are not obtained within the initial five-year period, the applicant remains responsible for restoration of the natural resource values and functions until the mitigation goals agreed to in the mitigation plan are achieved.
(i) Wetland Preservation as Mitigation. Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement, provided that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by re-establishment or creation. Ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation generally range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being altered and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.
Preservation of high-quality, at-risk wetlands and habitat may be considered as the sole means of compensation for wetland impacts when the following criteria are met:
(i) The area proposed for preservation is of high quality. The following features may be indicative of high-quality sites:
(aa) Category I or II wetland rating (using the wetland rating system for eastern Washington).
(bb) Rare wetland type (for example, bogs, mature forested wetlands, estuarine wetlands).
(cc) The presence of habitat for priority or locally important wildlife species.
(dd) Priority sites in an adopted watershed plan.
(ii) Wetland impacts will not have a significant adverse impact on habitat for listed fish, or other ESA-listed species.
(iii) There is no net loss of habitat functions within the watershed or basin.
(iv) Mitigation ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation shall generally start at 20:1. Specific ratios should depend upon the significance of the preservation project and the quality of the wetland resources lost.
(v) Permanent preservation of the wetland and buffer will be provided through a conservation easement or tract held by a land trust.
(vi) The impact area is small (generally less than half an acre) and/or impacts are occurring to a low-functioning system (Category III or IV wetland).
All preservation sites shall include buffer areas adequate to protect the habitat and its functions from encroachment and degradation.

(Ord. 16-3 §38, 2016)
16.55.380 Frequently Flooded Areas.
(1) Classification. The flood areas in the City are classified as either one of two types:
(a) Floodway. Floodways are defined as the channel of a stream and adjacent land areas which are
required to carry and discharge the flood water or flood flows of any river or stream associated with a regulatory flood.
(b) Flood Fringe. The flood fringe is defined as that land area which is outside a stream’s floodway, but is subject to periodic inundation due to flooding, associated with a regulatory flood.
(2) Designation and Mapping. All areas within the City meeting the frequently flooded definition, regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this Chapter. The approximate location and extent of frequently flooded areas are shown on the pertinent City critical area map. This map is to be used as a guide for the City, project applicants, and property owners, and will be periodically updated as new information becomes available. This map is a reference and does not provide a final critical area designation. Frequently flooded areas have been accurately delineated based on hydrologic and hydraulic studies completed as part of the National Flood Insurance Program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in May 1981, as amended. The methodology and detail of these studies is accepted as the most current, accurate, and complete scientific and technical information available.
(3) Existing Regulations. Chapter 17.100 of the Pullman City Code regulates proposed activities adjacent to or within frequently flooded areas. If allowed, any structures permitted in the designated flood areas are subject to strict flood-proofing regulations.
(Ord. 16-3 §39, 2016)
16.55.390 Geologically Hazardous Areas.
(1) General Designation. Geologically hazardous areas in shoreline jurisdiction include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as a geologically hazardous area:
(a) Erosion hazard;
(b) Landslide hazard;
(c) Seismic hazard;
(d) Mine hazard;
(e) Volcanic hazard; and
(f) Other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement.
(2) Designation of Specific Hazard Areas.
(a) Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) as having a "moderate to severe,” “severe," or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard. Rill erosion tends to occur on slopes, particularly steep slopes with easily-erodable soils or poor vegetation. Erosion hazard areas also include those areas with a slope greater than fifteen percent (15%).
(b) Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Example of these may include, but are not limited to the following:
(i) Areas of historic failures, such as:
(aa) Those areas delineated by the USDA-NRCS as having a "severe" limitation for building site development for factors other than slope for one or more types of building development;
(bb) Those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (“U” or class 3), unstable old slides (“UOS” or class 4), or unstable recent slides (“URS” or class 5); or
(cc) Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources;
(ii) Areas with all three of the following characteristics:
(aa) Slopes steeper than fifteen percent (15%);
(bb) Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and
(cc) Springs or ground water seepage;
(iii) Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;
(iv) Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials;
(v) Slopes having gradients steeper than eighty percent (80%) subject to rock fall during seismic shaking;
(vi) Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, streambank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;
(vii) Areas that show evidence of, or are at risk from snow avalanches;
(viii)Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; and
(ix) Any area with a slope of forty percent (40%) or steeper and with a vertical relief of ten or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock.
(c) Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of
earthquake damage in Washington. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by:
(i) The magnitude of an earthquake;
(ii) The distance from the source of an earthquake;
(iii) The type or thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and
(iv) The type of subsurface geologic structure.
Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless, loose, or soft-saturated soils of low density, typically in association with a shallow ground water table.
(d) Mine Hazard Areas. Mine hazard areas are those areas underlain by, or affected by mine workings such as adits, gangways, tunnels, drifts, or airshafts, and those areas of probable sink holes, gas releases, or subsidence due to mine workings. Steep and unstable slopes may be created by open mines (e.g. open basalt rock pits, rock quarries, sand and gravel pits). Factors that should be considered include: proximity to development, depth from ground surface to the mine working, and geologic material.
(e) Volcanic Hazard Areas. Volcanic hazard areas are areas subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows, debris avalanche, inundation by debris flows, lahars, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from volcanic activity.
(f) Other Hazard Areas. Geologically hazardous areas shall also include areas determined by the SMP Administrator to be susceptible to other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement.
(3) Classification. The level of risk for each geologic hazard type is described in this subsection. Documentation of specific areas in which a known or suspected risk exists for each of the following hazard areas is provided in the pertinent City critical area map. The provisions of this Section apply only to those areas for which a known or suspected risk exists in shoreline jurisdiction.
Table 16.55.390-1. Classification of Geologic Hazard Risk Classification Documentation and Data Sources
Known or Suspected Risk
Documentation or projection of the hazard by a qualified professional exists.

(2) Regulations.
(a) New development must be located and designed to avoid the need for future shoreline stabilization, if feasible.
(i) Land subdivisions must be designed based on a geotechnical report to assure that future development of the created lots will not require shore stabilization for reasonable development to occur.
(ii) New development adjacent to steep slopes or bluffs must be set back sufficiently to ensure that shoreline stabilization is unlikely to be necessary during the life of the structure, as demonstrated in a geotechnical report.
(b) New development that would require shoreline stabilization that would cause significant impacts to adjacent or down-current properties and shoreline areas is prohibited.
(c) All proposals for shoreline stabilization structures, both individually and cumulatively, must not result in a net loss of ecological functions, and must be the minimum size necessary. Soft approaches shall be used unless demonstrated not to be sufficient to protect primary structures, dwellings, and businesses.
(d) New or enlarged structural shoreline stabilization measures shall not be allowed, except as follows:
(i) To protect an existing primary structure, including residences, when conclusive evidence, documented by a geotechnical analysis, is provided that the structure is in danger from shoreline erosion caused by
currents or waves. Normal sloughing, erosion of steep bluffs, or shoreline erosion itself, without a scientific or geotechnical analysis, is not demonstration of need. The geotechnical analysis must evaluate on-site drainage issues and address drainage problems away from the shoreline edge before considering hard or soft structural shoreline stabilization.
(ii) In support of new nonwater-dependent development, including single-family residences, when all of the conditions below apply:
(aa) The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as loss of vegetation and drainage.
(bb) Nonstructural measures, such as placing the development farther from the shoreline, reducing the size or scope of the proposal, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient.
(cc) The need to protect primary structures from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report. The damage must be caused by natural processes, such as currents or waves.
(iii) In support of water-dependent development when all of the conditions below apply:
(aa) The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as loss of vegetation and drainage.
(bb) Nonstructural measures, such as planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible over time or sufficient.
(cc) The need to protect primary structures from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report.
(iv) To protect projects for the restoration of ecological functions or for hazardous substance remediation projects pursuant to Chapter 70.105D RCW when nonstructural measures, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient to adequately address erosion causes or impacts.
(e) New hard structural shoreline stabilization measures shall not be authorized, except when a geotechnical report confirms that:
(i) There is a significant possibility that a primary structure will be damaged within three years as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of such hard structural shoreline stabilization measures, or
(ii) Delaying installation of new hard structural shoreline stabilization would preclude use of measures that would avoid impacts on ecological functions.
(f) New soft structural shoreline stabilization measures may be authorized when a geotechnical report confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure, but the need is not as immediate as three years.
(g) An existing shoreline stabilization structure, hard or soft, may be replaced with a similar structure if there is a demonstrated need to protect principal uses or structures from erosion caused by currents or waves. While replacement of shoreline stabilization structures may meet the criteria for exemption from a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit, such activity is not exempt from the policies and regulations of this SMP.
(i) For purposes of this Section, "replacement" means the construction of new structure to perform a shoreline stabilization function of existing structure that can no longer adequately serve its purpose. Any additions to or increases in the size of existing shoreline stabilization measures shall be considered new structures.
(ii) Replacement shall be regulated as a new shoreline stabilization measure, except for the requirement to prepare a geotechnical analysis. A geotechnical analysis is not required for replacements of existing hard or soft structural shoreline stabilization with a similar or softer measure if the applicant demonstrates need to protect principal uses or structures from erosion caused by waves or other natural processes operating at or waterward of the OHWM.
(iii) Replacement hard structural shoreline stabilization measures shall not encroach waterward of the OHWM or waterward of the existing shoreline stabilization measure unless the residence was occupied prior to January 1, 1992, and there are overriding safety or environmental concerns. In such cases, the replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure. All other replacement hard structural shoreline stabilization measures shall be located at or landward of the existing shoreline stabilization structure.
(iv) Hard and soft shoreline stabilization measures may allow some fill waterward of the OHWM to provide enhancement of shoreline ecological functions through creation of nearshore shallow-water habitat and shoreline rearing habitat for salmonids.
(h) Repair and maintenance of existing shoreline stabilization measures may be allowed, subject to the following standards. While repair and maintenance of shoreline stabilization structures may meet the criteria for exemption from a Shoreline Substantial Development Permit, such activity is not exempt from the policies and regulations of this SMP.
(i) Repair and maintenance includes modifications to an existing shoreline stabilization measure that are designed to ensure the continued function of the measure by preventing failure of any part. Limitations on repair and maintenance include:
(aa) If within a three-year time period, more than fifty percent (50%) of the length of an existing structure is removed, including its footing or bottom course of rock, prior to placement of new stabilization materials, such work will not be considered repair and maintenance and shall be considered replacement. Work that only involves the removal of material above the footing or bottom course of rock does not constitute replacement.
(bb) Any additions to or increases in the size of existing shoreline stabilization measures shall be considered new structures.
(cc) The placement of a new shoreline stabilization structure landward of a failing shoreline stabilization structure shall be considered a new structure, not maintenance or repair.
(dd) Areas of temporary disturbance within the shoreline buffer shall be expeditiously restored to their pre-project condition or better.
(i) Structural shoreline stabilization design and construction standards:
(i) Structural shoreline stabilization measures shall not extend waterward more than the minimum amount necessary to achieve effective stabilization, except for those elements that enhance shoreline ecological functions and minimize impacts.
(ii) Stairs or other water access measures may be incorporated into shoreline stabilization measures, but shall not extend waterward of the measure or the OHWM.
(iii) All structural shoreline stabilization measures must minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts to ecological functions resulting from short-term construction activities. Techniques may include compliance with timing restrictions, use of
best management practices, and stabilization of exposed soils following construction.
(j) In addition to other submittal requirements, the applicant shall submit the following as part of a request to construct a new, enlarged, or replacement shoreline stabilization measure:
(i) For a new or enlarged hard or soft structural shoreline stabilization measure, a geotechnical report prepared by a qualified professional with a Washington state engineering license. The report shall include the following:
(aa) An assessment of the necessity for structural shoreline stabilization by estimating time frames and rates of erosion and reporting on the urgency associated with the specific situation.
(bb) An assessment of the cause of erosion, looking at processes occurring both waterward and landward of the OHWM, and documentation of the OHWM field determination.
(cc) An assessment of alternative measures to shoreline stabilization.
(dd) Where structural shoreline stabilization is determined to be necessary, the assessment must evaluate the feasibility of using soft shoreline stabilization measures in lieu of hard structural shoreline stabilization measures.
(ee) Design recommendations for minimum sizing of hard structural or soft structural shoreline stabilization materials, including gravel and cobble beach substrates necessary to dissipate wave energy, eliminate scour, and provide long-term shoreline stability.
(ii) For replacements of existing hard structural shoreline stabilization measures with a similar measure, the applicant shall submit a written narrative providing a demonstration of need. The narrative must be prepared by a qualified professional. The
demonstration of need shall consist of the following:
(aa) An assessment of the necessity for continued structural shoreline stabilization, considering site-specific conditions such as water depth, orientation of the shoreline, wave fetch or flow velocities, and location of the nearest primary structure.
(bb) An assessment of erosion potential resulting from the action of waves or other natural processes operating at or waterward of the OHWM in the absence of the hard structural shoreline stabilization, and documentation of the OHWM field determination.
(cc) An assessment of alternative measures to shoreline stabilization.
(dd) An assessment of the feasibility of using soft shoreline stabilization measures in lieu of hard structural shoreline stabilization measures.
(ee) Design recommendations for minimizing impacts of any necessary hard structural shoreline stabilization.
The demonstration of need may be waived when an existing hard structural shoreline stabilization measure is proposed to be repaired or replaced using soft structural shoreline stabilization measures, resulting in significant restoration of shoreline ecological functions or processes.
(iii) For all structural shoreline stabilization measures, including soft structural shoreline stabilization, detailed construction plans, including, but not limited to, the following:
(aa) Plan and cross-section views of the existing and proposed shoreline configuration, showing accurate existing and proposed topography and OHWMs.
(bb) Detailed construction sequence and specifications for all materials, including gravels, cobbles, boulders, logs, and vegetation.

NONCONFORMING USES, BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES, AND LOTS
Sections:
17.30.010 Purpose.
17.30.020 Nonconforming Uses.
17.30.030 Nonconforming Buildings or Structures.
17.30.040 Nonconforming Lots.
17.30.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to allow certain nonconforming uses, buildings, and lots to continue while prohibiting further nonconformity. (Ord. No. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.30.020 Nonconforming Uses.
(1) Definition. A nonconforming use is a use that was once allowed by applicable land use regulations, but is no longer allowed due to the passage or later change of this Title, or where applicable of prior land use regulations of the city.
(2) Continuation. Except as qualified in 17.30.020(3), a nonconforming use may continue, but it may not be altered or changed in any way except as herein allowed, nor may the structure in which it is located be enlarged or extended in any way such as by increasing square footage, increasing building or structure height or the extension thereof by the addition of accessory buildings or structures, or other similar extension. Changes in a nonconforming use such as the addition of more employees, the addition of more or better equipment, extending the hours of operation, and other similar changes which could or do result in an intensification of a nonconforming use are allowed and conditional use permits shall not be required for making any such change or changes.
(3) Nonconforming Single Family Dwellings in the C2 and C3 Districts. Nonconforming single family dwellings in the C2 and C3 districts may be enlarged or expanded provided that the setback requirements for residences in the R4 zone district are observed.
(4) Lapse of Time.
(a) If any nonconforming use is not occupied or operated for a continuous period of one (1) year, any later use of the property occupied by the former nonconforming use shall conform to all provisions of this Title.
(b) If any nonconforming use is not occupied or operated because its building has sustained damage amounting to less than seventy-five (75) percent of its value, that use may be reestablished if construction of a new or repaired building begins within one (1) year of the date the damage occurred.
(5) Conditional Uses. A legal use does not become nonconforming if the zone district in which it is located is changed to a zone district in which a conditional use permit is required for that use. However, the use may not be altered or changed; nor, may the building or structure in which it is located be enlarged or extended without obtaining a conditional use permit. Any use legally existing prior to the effective date of this Title, or prior to the effective date of subsequent amendments to this Title or the Official Zoning Map which is within the scope of uses permitted by a conditional use permit in the district in which the property is located shall be deemed a conditional use without the necessity of a conditional use permit, provided that any expansion or alteration of said use shall conform to all regulations pertaining to conditional uses.
(6) Conversions. A nonconforming use may be converted to another nonconforming use if the board of adjustment issues a conditional use permit for the conversion, pursuant to the procedures of Chapter 17.125. The board may issue such a conditional use permit only after finding that
(a) the structure housing the existing nonconforming use cannot reasonably be used for any permitted use because of its particular design; and,
(b) the proposed use will be as compatible with uses permitted in the zone district as the existing nonconforming use; and,
(c) measures will be taken, where necessary, to protect the neighborhood from any detrimental effects to the public health and welfare that will or probably will result from the conversion of the nonconforming use.
In cases involving the conversion of nonconforming uses, it is not necessary for the board to make the findings as set forth in 17.125.020 in addition to the findings required by this subsection. (Ord. No. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.30.030 Nonconforming Buildings or Structures.
(1) Definition. A nonconforming building or structure is one that was once allowed by applicable land use regulations, but no longer would be allowed, due to the passage or later change of this Title or, where applicable, prior land use regulations of the city.
(2) Continuation. A nonconforming building or structure may be continued, but it may not be altered, enlarged or extended unless this alteration, enlargement, or extension fully conforms with existing standards. The terms "enlarged and extended" as used herein mean the enlargement of a building or structure by increasing square footage, increasing building or structure height or the extension thereof by the addition of accessory buildings or structures or other similar extensions.
(3) Value. The value of a nonconforming building or structure shall be determined from the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) building permit valuation tables in use on the date the damage occurs. The owner of a damaged building or structure may obtain an independent appraisal. Any discrepancies as to value between the two appraisals shall be referred to the board of adjustment for resolution.
(4) Maintenance and Alterations.
(a) Ordinary maintenance and repair of a nonconforming building or structure are allowed.
(b) Alterations which conform to all provisions of this Title, do not result in any enlargement or extension
of a nonconforming use, building, or structure are allowed.
(c) Alterations required by law to meet health and safety regulations are allowed.
(5) Damage and Reconstruction.
(a) If any nonconforming structure located in a nonresidential zone is destroyed or sustains damages amounting to seventy-five (75) percent or more of its value, then any future use of the property formerly occupied by that building or structure shall conform to all requirements of this Title.
(b) If any nonconforming structure located in a nonresidential zone sustains damages amounting to less than seventy-five (75) percent of its value, it may be reconstructed and used for the nonconforming use in existence at the time the damage occurred if the reconstruction begins within one (1) year from the date the damage occurred. The structure may be rebuilt having the same zoning nonconformities, but no more than as existed before the damage occurred. The damage to the structure must be the result of some unforeseen event such as a fire or flood, or the result of natural deterioration, as opposed to the voluntary demolition of part of the structure by the owner.
(c) If any nonconforming residential structure located in a residential zone is destroyed or sustains damages up to one hundred (100) percent of its value, the structure may be reconstructed having the same zoning nonconformities, but no more than as existed before the damage occurred; provided, however, parking shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Code in existence at the time of application for a building permit to repair or replace the damaged structure. The damage to the structure must be the result of some unforeseen event such as a fire or flood, or the result of natural deterioration, as opposed to the voluntary demolition of all or part of the structure by the owner. (Ord. 03-33 §5, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987)
17.30.040 Nonconforming Lots.
(1) Definition. A nonconforming lot is one that was once allowed by applicable land use regulations but is no
longer allowed, due to the passage or later change of this Title or, where applicable, prior land use regulations of the city.
(2) Continuation.
(a) For a period of five (5) years following the date of approval of a long plat, lots in any subdivision filed for record, regardless of whether the lots are in single and separate or contiguous ownership, may be developed for the uses and densities allowed at the time of the final plat approval. Any development regulations enacted during this five (5) year period other than use and density regulations become applicable to such a subdivision at the time of the adoption of those regulations. Parcels platted under the short plat procedure shall not be covered by the provisions of this subsection.
(b) Any nonconforming lot not subject to the exception stated in 17.30.040(2)(a), and not contiguous to other lots in the same ownership may be used for any use allowed in the zone district in which it is located, even though that lot does not meet the size, width, depth, or other dimensional requirements of that district, so long as all other applicable standards are met, or a variance from those standards is obtained. “Other applicable standards,” as used in this Paragraph, include density, building height, required yards, open space, landscaping, and off-street parking. Documenting proof of the fact that the lot existed of record at the time of the passage of this Title shall be submitted by the person claiming the benefits of this section.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Subsection, the establishment of one single family house on a nonconforming lot in a residential zone district is allowed.
(3) Lot Line Adjustments. When an existing lot is subdivided or is the subject of a lot line adjustment, the new lot lines shall not make any existing improvements nonconforming to the regulations of this Title. (Ord. No. 03-33 §6 Ord. No. 87-9 §1, 1987).

17.37.010 Purpose.
(1) Objective. The objective of this Chapter is to provide for regulation of adult entertainment establishments in a manner that fosters land use compatibility within the city.
(2) Findings. The City Council of the City of Pullman, based upon evidence generated by other jurisdictions that is reasonably believed to be relevant to the issues addressed herein by the City of Pullman, finds that the commercial offering of adult entertainment businesses, especially those containing adult arcade devices, is a use which, although afforded some constitutional protection, often creates or exacerbates undesirable secondary effects in the community. These adverse secondary effects include a wide range of unlawful activities that have regularly and historically occurred, within or in close proximity to such businesses including acts of prostitution, narcotics and liquor law violations, breaches of the peace, assaults and sexual conduct and other criminal activity and, further, the concentration of such adult entertainment businesses can result in a decline in the market value of surrounding property, and can contribute to a general deterioration of the downtown core area of the city.
(3) Intent. It is not the intent of this ordinance to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses.
17.37.020 Definitions.
(1) Adult Entertainment. Adult entertainment is defined as:
(a) Any exhibition, performance, or dance of any type conducted in a premises where such exhibition, performance, or dance involves a person(s) who is unclothed or clothed in such costume, attire, or clothing as to expose any “specified anatomical areas” as defined in 17.37.020(4);
(b) Any exhibition, performance, or dance of any type conducted in a premises where such exhibition, performance, or dance is distinguished or characterized by a predominant emphasis on the depiction, description, simulation of, or relation to, "specified sexual activities" as defined in 17.37.020(5); or
(c) Any exhibition, performance, or dance conducted in a premises where such exhibition, performance, or dance is performed for, arranged with, or engaged in with fewer than all patrons on the premises at that time, with separate consideration paid, either directly or indirectly, for such exhibition, performance, or dance where such exhibition, performance, or dance involves a person who is unclothed or clothed in such costume, attire or clothing as to expose any "specified anatomical areas" as defined in 17.37.020(4). For purposes of example and not limitation, such exhibitions, performances, or dances are commonly referred to as table dancing, couch dancing, taxi dancing, lap dancing, private dancing, or straddle dancing.
(2) Adult Entertainment Business. Adult entertainment business means the following establishments:
(a) Adult Arcade. An establishment containing any individual viewing areas or booths, where, for any form of consideration, including a membership fee, one or more still or motion picture projectors, slide projectors, or similar machines, or other image producing machines are
used to show films, motion pictures, video cassettes, slides, or other photographic reproduction of sexual conduct, or adult entertainment.
(b) Adult Cabaret. A nightclub, bar, restaurant, theater, or auditorium, or similar commercial establishment, whether or not alcoholic beverages are served, which presents adult entertainment.
(c) Adult Motel. A hotel, motel, or similar commercial establishment which:
(i) offers sleeping accommodation to the public for any form of consideration and, as a significant purpose of its business, provides patrons with closed-circuit television transmissions, films, motion pictures, video cassettes, slides, or other photographic reproductions which are characterized by the depiction or description of "specified anatomical areas" as defined in 17.37.020(4) or "specified sexual activities" as defined in 17.37.020(5) and are not rated G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, or R by the Motion Picture Association of America; or
(ii) does a significant business renting sleeping rooms for a period of time that is less than ten (10) hours; or
(iii) allows a tenant or occupant of a sleeping room to sub-rent the room for a period of time that is less than ten (10) hours.
A hotel or motel providing overnight accommodations is not considered an adult motel merely because it provides adult closed-circuit television programming in its rooms for its registered overnight guests.
(d) Adult Motion Picture Theater. A commercial establishment or drive-in theater where a significant portion of the films, motion pictures, video cassettes, slides, or similar photographic reproductions are shown for any form
of consideration and are characterized by the depiction or description of "specified anatomical areas" as defined in 17.37.020(4) or "specified sexual activities" as defined in 17.37.020(5) and are not rated G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, or R by the Motion Picture Association of America.
(e) Adult Retail Store. An enclosed building, or any portion thereof which, for money or any other form of consideration, devotes a significant or substantial portion of its stock in trade to the sale, exchange, retail, loan, trade, transfer, or viewing of “adult-oriented merchandise” as defined in 17.37.020(3). For purposes of this definition, a retail store devotes a significant or substantial portion of its stock in trade to adult-oriented merchandise if the sale, exchange, rental, loan, trade, transfer or viewing of such adult-oriented merchandise is clearly material to the economic viability of the business. It is rebuttably presumed that such adult-oriented merchandise is clearly material to the viability of the retail business if adult-oriented merchandise accounts for: (1) 30 percent or more of the display area of the store open to the public; (2) 30 percent or more of the retail dollar value of all merchandise displayed in the store; or (3) 30 percent or more of the store’s inventory (whether measured by retail dollar value or number of items). In no event shall a retailer whose transactions only incidentally or marginally relate to adult-oriented merchandise be considered an adult retail store.
(f) Other Adult Entertainment Establishment. Any commercial establishment to which any patron is invited or admitted and where adult entertainment is presented or sold as a substantial portion of its volume or trade, including, but not limited to, escort agencies, semi-nude or nude modeling studios, or similar establishments.
(3) Adult-oriented Merchandise. Any goods, products, commodities, or other ware including but not limited to videos, CD ROMs, DVDs, computer disks or other storage devices, magazines, books, pamphlets, posters, cards, periodicals or non-clothing novelties which
depict, describe or simulate "specified anatomical areas" as defined in 17.37.020(4) or "specified sexual activities" as defined in 17.37.020(5).
(4) Specified Anatomical Areas. Specified anatomical areas means (a) human genitals, pubic region, buttock and female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola, when such areas are less than completely and opaquely covered; (b) human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely and opaquely covered.

17.45.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish minimum requirements for the landscaping and screening needed to increase compatibility between different intensities of land use, to provide visual relief from the barren expanse of paved parking lots, to screen undesirable views that have a blighting impact on surrounding properties, and to provide a visual separation and physical buffer between incompatible abutting land uses. It is the intent of these requirements to encourage the retention of existing vegetation including significant trees to the extent feasible and to require replacement if significant existing trees are removed; to reduce erosion and storm water runoff; to preserve and promote urban wildlife habitats; to minimize the impacts of noise, light and glare; to aid in regulating vehicular circulation; and to make the city a more aesthetically pleasing place to live, shop, and work. In all cases, low water use landscaping is preferred over that which demands more significant amounts of irrigation. (Ord. 03-33 §16, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.020 Applicability. Except as otherwise provided in this Title, the provisions of this Chapter shall apply to:
(1) all new developments;
(2) any addition to an existing structure when the cost of
the addition exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current assessed valuation of the existing structure;
(3) any expansion of a manufactured home park in which the number of new manufactured home lots exceeds fifty (50) percent of the number of existing manufactured home lots;
(4) situations where this Chapter imposes a requirement for buffering or screening between two (2) uses, one of which is existing and the other new. The responsibility for satisfying this requirement rests entirely on the new use. (Ord. 03-33 §17, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.030 Landscaping and Screening Requirements for Parking Areas and Loading Berths. Parking areas and loading berths shall comply with the following requirements:
(1) Parking areas with twenty (20) or more spaces shall have at least ten (10) percent of the total parking area landscaped. Parking areas with one hundred (100) or more spaces shall have at least twenty-five (25) percent of the required ten (10) percent to be landscaped located in the interior of the lot.
(2) No required planting areas shall be less than twenty-four (24) square feet in area with the exception of raised planter boxes around or in close proximity to buildings.
(3) When landscaping is required as set forth in Subsection (1) of this Section, then an average of at least one (1) tree shall be planted for every ten (10) single row parking stalls or every twenty (20) double row parking stalls within the parking area.
(4) Landscaping material shall be selected with careful consideration to eventual size and spread, susceptibility to disease and pests, durability and adaptability to existing soil and climatic conditions, and ability to prosper with limited irrigation.
(5) Landscaping in the interior of the parking area shall be contained by a bumper rail or curb which is at least four (4) inches high.
(6) All off-street parking areas which include five (5) or more parking spaces and all loading berths shall be screened from a contiguous residentially zoned lot or residential use. Such screening shall be in the form of a wall, fence, or earth berm or slope not less than
four (4) feet in height and sufficient in density to shield from direct lighting, including automobile headlights. A Type I landscape strip as set forth in 17.45.080 may be substituted for such wall, fence, or berm.
(7) All off-street parking areas which include five (5) or more parking spaces and all loading berths shall be screened from a residentially zoned lot or residential use that is located across a street from said parking area or loading berth. Such screening shall be in the form of a Type I landscape strip as set forth in 17.45.080. Breaks or modifications in required screening may be permitted to provide vehicular or pedestrian access to a public right-of-way and to conform with the vision clearance area provisions set forth in 17.35.020(3). (Ord. 03-33 §18, 2003; Ord. 02-32 §6, 2002; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.040 Landscaping of Required Open Space. All open space areas required by the provisions of this Title shall be landscaped with planting materials except those portions of the area covered by sidewalks or recreational facilities such as a swimming pool or tennis court which require a special surface. Planting materials may include lawn, shrubs, flowers, decorative rock, bark chips, and/or deciduous and evergreen trees.
Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape design as set forth in 17.45.090 and shall be considered in lieu of new plantings, provided that it contributes to achieving the purpose of this Chapter. The installation of low water use landscaping is encouraged. (Ord. 03-33 §19, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.050 Screening Between Uses and Districts. The following screening requirements shall be applicable:
(1) When a nonresidential use except a park abuts residentially zoned property or a residential use, the following screening provisions shall apply to the nonresidential use:
(a) a minimum six (6) foot high screening device, such as a sight-obscuring fence or wall shall be installed along the abutting property line between the nonresidential use and the residentially zoned property or residential use; and
(b) a landscape strip of evergreen trees and/or evergreen shrubs shall be planted within ten (10) horizontal feet of the screening device required in 17.45.050(1)(a), with said trees and/or shrubs being a minimum height of eight (8) feet at time of planting and spaced so as to grow together within three (3) years of their planting in a manner sufficient to screen views along the length of the landscape strip.
(2) When a high density residential zone (R3, R4) abuts a low density residential zone (R1, RT, R2), the following screening provisions shall apply to any development in the R3 or R4 zone that requires site plan review in accordance with Chapter 17.135:
(a) a minimum six (6) foot high screening device, such as a sight-obscuring fence or wall shall be installed along the abutting property line between the R3 or R4 zone and the R1, RT, or R2 zone; and,
(b) a landscape strip of evergreen trees and/or evergreen shrubs shall be planted within ten (10) horizontal feet of the screening device required in 17.45.050(2)(a), with said trees and/or shrubs being a minimum height of eight (8) feet at time of planting and spaced so as to grow together within three (3) years of their planting in a manner sufficient to screen views along the length of the landscape strip.
(3) When a fence is used as the screening device in accordance with this Section, said fence shall be composed of wood, vinyl, or other solid material approved by the city planner. A chain link fence with slats may not be used to meet this requirement. (Ord. 03-33 §20, 2003; Ord. 02-32 §7, 2002; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.060 Outdoor Storage - Commercial and Industrial Districts. Permitted outdoor storage and outdoor storage areas in commercial and industrial districts exposed to view from any street adjacent to the property on which the storage area is located shall be screened by a sight-obscuring fence or a minimum five (5) foot wide planting area with Type I landscaping as set forth in 17.45.080.
Materials covered by buildings with roofs only but without any sides shall be considered outdoor storage and shall be subject to the screening provisions of this section. This provision shall not apply to the display of new or used agricultural implements, motor vehicles, or watercraft where such activities are an integral part of an automobile, agricultural implement, or watercraft dealership or storage facility. (Ord. No. 90-15 §1, 1990; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.065 Scrap and Waste Material - Industrial Districts. Facilities or sites for the storage, processing, and/or sale of scrap or waste materials, such as scrap metals, hides, and wrecked vehicles, shall be completely fenced; and shall be fully screened from view with a Type I buffer, as defined in Chapter 17.45 or, with a fence fully screening the facility or site from view. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.067 Screening of Solid Waste Dumpsters and Self-contained, Liquid-tight, Compacting Solid Waste Containers. Dumpsters and self-contained, liquid-tight, compacting solid waste containers placed in all zone districts to serve structures for which building permits are issued after the effective date of the ordinance shall be screened as follows:
(1) Dumpsters and self-contained, liquid-tight, compacting solid waste containers on property that is not within the public right of way shall be screened on a minimum of three sides by a building, hillside, sight-obscuring fence, or sight-obscuring landscaping, or combination thereof. Dumpsters and self-contained, liquid-tight, compacting solid waste containers shall be screened on the side of the Dumpster or container facing a public street(s) as one of the minimum three sides required to be screened.
(2) Dumpsters and self-contained, liquid-tight, compacting solid waste containers within the public right of way shall be screened on four sides by a building, hillside, sight-obscuring fence, or sight obscuring landscaping.
(3) Screening shall not be required for dumpsters located on a temporary one-time basis to handle special circumstances such as construction projects and large scale clean-up efforts.
Where screening is required, the city planner shall consult with the solid waste collector prior to making a determination of exact requirements for screening in an attempt to prevent the
required screening from becoming unduly burdensome on the solid waste collector or the person required to provide the screening. (Ord. 03-33 §21, 2003; Ord. 90-15 §2, 1990).
17.45.070 Definition and Retention of Significant Trees. Significant trees are defined and shall be retained as follows:
(1) Definition. Significant trees are those trees which fall into the following categories:
(a) healthy trees over twenty-five (25) feet in height;
(b) trees over ten (10) feet in height which form a continuous canopy.
(2) Retention: Significant trees shall be retained to the maximum extent possible.
(a) Minor Site Plan Changes Required by the City. The city may require minor alterations in the arrangement of buildings and other elements of the proposed development in order to achieve the maximum retention of significant trees, but the city may not require an alteration which will result in an unreasonable added expenditure to the applicant or in any decrease in the number of units or bulk of structures permitted.
(b) Replacement of Removed Significant Trees. If any significant trees on the subject property are to be removed as a result of the development, the city may require the applicant to plant trees on the subject property. The maximum number of trees that the city may require the applicant to plant is three (3) times the number of significant trees that are removed. The trees that are planted must be at least eight (8) feet in height and two (2) inches in diameter as measured one (1) foot above grade. When determined appropriate by the city planner to meet the purposes of this Chapter, he or she may specify the species of trees to be planted.
(c) Protection Techniques. In order to provide conditions likely to result in the retention of significant trees, the applicant shall comply with the following requirements:
(i) The applicant shall not excavate within the area defined by the drip line of any tree to be retained.
(ii) During the period of construction when a significant tree will be endangered, the applicant shall erect a temporary but immovable four (4) foot high sturdy enclosure generally corresponding to the drip line of each tree to be retained.
(iii) If the grade level adjoining a tree to be retained is to be raised, the applicant shall construct a dry rock wall or rock well around the tree. The diameter of this wall or well must be equal to the diameter of the tree plus five (5) feet.
(iv) The applicant shall not install impervious surface within the area defined by the drip line of any tree to be retained.
(v) The applicant shall prune branches and roots, fertilize, and water as appropriate.
(vi) The grade level around any tree to be retained shall not be lowered within the greater of the following areas:
(a) the area defined by the drip line of the tree;
(b) an area around the tree equal to one (1) foot in diameter for each one (1) inch of tree diameter as measured one (1) foot above grade.
(d) Alternative Techniques. The city planner may approve the use of alternative tree protection techniques if the significant trees will be protected to an equal or greater degree than by the techniques listed in 17.45.070(2)(c).
(e) Tree Restoration. If any tree designated for retention or required to be planted is damaged or destroyed during construction or within two (2) years following the end of construction through the fault of the applicant, the applicant shall obtain and plant in the immediate vicinity of the damaged or destroyed tree a replacement tree of the same species at least two (2) inches in diameter as measured one (1) foot above grade. The city may require the applicant to remove the damaged or destroyed tree. (Ord. 03-33 §22, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.080 Types of Landscaping Requirements. The following are the types of landscaping required by the provisions of this Title. All proposed plant material, sizes, and characteristics shall be in accordance with the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1.1980):
(1) TYPE I: SCREEN. Type I landscaping shall generally consist of a mix of predominantly evergreen plantings including trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum height of four (4) feet at time of planting. Plantings shall be chosen and spaced so as to grow together within three (3) years of their planting in a manner that is sufficient to obscure sight through the barrier. The entire planting strip shall be landscaped; however, those plantings used to achieve the sight-obscuring screen shall cover at least five (5) feet of the width of the strip. Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape design as set forth in 17.45.090 and shall be considered acceptable in lieu of new plantings, provided that it contributes to achieving the purpose of this Chapter.

(2) TYPE II: VISUAL BUFFER. Type II landscaping shall consist of a mix of evergreen and deciduous plantings including trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Plantings of shrubs and ground covers shall be chosen and spaced to result in a total covering of the landscape strip. Shrubs shall be of a type that achieve a height of approximately six (6) feet within three (3) years of their planting in a manner sufficient to screen views along the length of the planting strip. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of one and three-quarter (1-3/4) inches at time of planting. All trees shall be spaced at intervals which should result in the touching of branches after ten (10) years of normal growth. Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape design as set forth in 17.45.090 and shall be considered acceptable in lieu of new plantings, provided that it contributes to achieving the purposes of this Chapter.
(2) TYPE III: SEE-THROUGH BUFFER. Type III landscaping shall consist of a mix of evergreen and deciduous plantings including trees, shrubs, and ground covers. Plantings of shrubs and ground covers shall be chosen and spaced to result in a covering of the landscape strip within three (3) years of their planting. Shrubs shall be of a type that do not exceed a height at maturity of four (4) feet. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of one and three-quarter (1-3/4) inches at time of planting, and shall be spaced at intervals which should result in the touch-ing of branches after ten (10) years of normal growth. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of four (4) feet tall at the time of their planting and shall be spaced so as to approximate the mature spread of the trees used. Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape design as set forth in 17.45.090 and shall be considered acceptable in lieu of new plantings, provided that it contributes to achieving
the purposes of this Chapter.
(4) TYPE IV: OPEN AREA LANDSCAPING. Type IV landscaping
shall consist of canopy-type evergreen and deciduous
trees or spreading evergreen trees planted in wells or
strips, with a mix of evergreen and deciduous ground
covers, low shrubs, and grass. Shrubs shall be of a
type that do not exceed a height at maturity of four
(4) feet. Planting wells or strips shall be of a size
appropriate to the planting materials. Deciduous
trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of one and
three-quarter (1-3/4) inches at time of planting.
Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of four (4) feet
tall at the time of their planting. Existing
vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape
design as set forth in 17.45.090 and shall be
considered acceptable in lieu of new plantings,
provided that it contributes to achieving the purposes
of this Chapter. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.090 Modification of Landscaping Requirements.
(1) The city planner may authorize reduced width of plantings or may waive some of the landscaping or screening requirements in the following instances:
(a) Topography. When the existing topography of the subject property or the adjoining property decreases or eliminates the need for screening.
(b) Views. When the modification will be more beneficial to the adjoining property than the required screen by causing less impairment of view or sunlight.
(c) Change in Use. When it is reasonable to believe that the adjoining property will be redeveloped in the foreseeable future to a use that would require no, or a less intensive, buffer.
(d) Excessive Requirements. When the application of the requirements of this Chapter would result in more than twenty (20) percent of the site area being landscaped. Required parking lot landscaping shall be counted as a percentage of overall required landscaping. In such cases, the city planner shall modify these requirements so that not more than twenty (20) percent of the site must be landscaped, provided that the landscaping and corresponding setbacks required are those that most reasonably satisfy the purposes of this Chapter.
(e) Existing Vegetation. When the inclusion of significant existing vegetation located on the site would result in as good as or better satisfaction of the purposes of this Chapter.
(2) The city planner shall take into account any written statements submitted by adjoining property owners in making a decision to modify landscaping requirements.
(3) The decision of the city planner regarding alternative landscaping shall be final unless an aggrieved person appeals that decision to the board of adjustment under the procedures as set forth in Chapter 17.185. (Ord. 03-33 §23, 2003; Ord. 02-32 §8, 2002; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.100 Landscaping Plan Requirements. A plan of the proposed landscaping and screening shall be provided which may
be incorporated into plans submitted for a preliminary plat review, site plan review, or building permit review. Landscaping plans shall be drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals forty (40) feet on a sheet(s) with minimum dimensions of eight and one-half (8½) inches by eleven (11) inches and maximum dimensions of twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six (36) inches, and shall include dimensions and distances, and shall clearly delineate the following:
(1) boundaries and dimensions of the site;
(2) location and identification of all streets, alleys, and easements on or abutting the site;
(3) proposed location and dimensions of all on-site buildings;
(4) existing and proposed topography at maximum five (5) foot contour intervals;
(5) proposed landscaping including location, size at time of planting, and description of landscape materials, using both botanical and common names;
(6) identification and location of existing vegetation to be retained; identification of all evergreen trees with trunks greater than eight (8) inches in diameter, and all deciduous trees greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter, as measured four (4) feet above ground level which are to be retained;
(7) details of any proposed berm, walls, retaining walls and similar man-made barriers;
(8) location of existing and proposed driveways, parking surfaces, curbs, and sidewalks; and
(9) type and location of the proposed irrigation system to maintain landscaping. (Ord. 03-33 §24, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.45.110 Installation and Maintenance Standards. The following installation and maintenance standards shall be applicable to required landscaping:
(1) All required landscaping shall be installed prior to occupancy or use; the city planner, however, may authorize up to a one (1) year delay where planting season conflicts would produce a high probability of plant loss. In no case may the property owner delay performance for more than one (1) year.
(2) The property owner shall maintain all required landscaping in a healthy growing condition and shall remove and replace any unhealthy or dead plant materials in conformance with the approved landscape plan for a period of two (2) years from the time of installation. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

(c) the C2 Central Business District was first constructed circa 1900. Some buildings within this district are characterized by the commercial architecture found in Pullman for this period. This architecture has predominant characteristics such as projecting cornices, continuous
horizontal and vertical lines, arches, transoms, and horizontal banding. It is the intent that signage for facades of buildings that expose these characteristics, whether built during this period or later, should be in harmony with the above characteristics. Signs erected on the street or the sidewalk facades of buildings having these characteristics shall to the greatest extent possible conform to the following guidelines:
(i) signs, including sign structure and exposed electrical service, should not interrupt the cornice lines or other horizontal and vertical lines.
(ii) signs should be placed in areas which were traditional sign board areas for the architecture of the structure involved, such as directly above doors, in display windows, in transoms, or on awnings.
(iii) the top of signs should not be higher than sixteen (16) feet above grade unless the original architecture of the building allowed for a greater height.
The city planner when reviewing an application for the signage of a building within the C2 Central Business District shall determine whether or not the exposed facade of the building is representative of the turn-of-the-century commercial architecture found in Pullman. If so, then the standards set forth in 17.50.050(3)(c)(i)(ii)(iii) shall apply. The city planner shall consult with the Main Street Design Committee or a similar group recognized by the City Council to determine if the signage will be consistent with the architectural integrity of the particular building.
(4) For signs in the C3 District, the aggregate gross area of all permanent signs except portable signs and identification signs for property occupied by any one use, multiple occupancy building, or shopping center shall not exceed two and one-half (2-½) square feet of sign surface area per foot of street frontage. In no
case shall a sign have more than two hundred (200) square feet of sign surface area.
(5) For signs in the IRP, I1, and I2 Districts, the aggregate gross area of all permanent signs except identification signs for property occupied by any one use, multiple occupancy building or shopping center shall not exceed two and one-half (2-½) square feet of sign surface area per foot of street frontage. In no case shall a sign have more than two hundred (200) square feet of sign surface area. (Ord. 90-10 §3, 1990; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.50.060 Prohibited Signs. The following types of signs are expressly prohibited:
(1) animated signs, except traditional barber poles, clock faces, and theater signs;
(2) signs advertising products or services not offered or sold on the premises, except signs of historic significance as determined by the city planner;
(3) any sign over forty-two (42) inches high in a required yard;
(4) any sign placed on, affixed to, or painted on a vehicle or trailer and placed on public or private property with the purpose of providing a sign not otherwise allowed;
(5) any sign imitating or resembling official traffic signs or signals. (Ord. No. 90-10 §4, 1990; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

17.55.010 Purpose
17.55.020 Definition
17.55.030 Performance Standards
17.55.040 Nonconforming Home Occupations
17.55.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to
(1) protect residential areas from the adverse impacts of activities associated with home occupations;
(2) permit residents of the community a broad choice in the use of their homes as a place of livelihood and the production or supplementing of personal and family income; and
(3) establish standards for home occupations conducted in dwelling units and their accessory structures. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.55.020 Definition. Home occupation
(1) means an accessory use of a dwelling unit involving the manufacture, provision, or sale of goods and/or services carried on by members of the family residing on the premises plus no more than one (1) nonresident assistant or employee;
(2) excludes garage sales, yard sales or home parties which are held for the purpose of sale or distribution of goods or services, except that if the total of all such sales and/or parties exceeds six (6) in any calendar year, such sales and/or parties shall be considered a home occupation. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.55.030 Performance Standards. All home occupations shall meet the following criteria:
(1) Except as permitted in this Chapter, a home occupation shall be conducted in a manner that does not give an outward appearance of, or manifest characteristics of a business, or would infringe on the right of neighboring residents to enjoy the peaceful occupancy
of their dwelling units, or infringe upon or change the intent of the residential zone district in which it is located. Therefore, there should be no outside storage or window display and noise, dust, odors, noxious fumes, radioactive emissions, or vibrations emanating from the premises should not exceed that which is normally produced by a single dwelling unit. Mechanical or electronic equipment which is incidental to the home occupation may be used provided it does not create visible or audible interference in radio or television receivers or cause fluctuations in line voltage off the premises. The home occupation shall not interfere with the delivery of utilities or other services to the area.
(2) The home occupation should not generate significantly greater traffic volume than would normally be expected in the residential district in which the home occupation is conducted. Generally, delivery and pick-up of materials or commodities to and from the premises by a commercial vehicle should not exceed two (2) trips per week.
(3) The parking of customers' or clients' vehicles should not create safety hazards or unusual congestion. At any one time, only one (1) commercial vehicle associated with the activities of the home occupation may be parked on-street near the premises for more than four (4) consecutive hours. One (1) additional off-street parking space shall be required above the normal parking requirements set forth in the Use Chart 17.70.030 for any home occupation where two (2) or more students or clients are likely to concurrently visit the premises and their methods of transportation are two (2) or more separate motor vehicles.
(4) The home occupation shall be conducted only by members of the family residing in the dwelling unit plus no more than one (1) nonresident assistant or employee. Persons engaged in building trades or similar fields who use their dwelling units or residential premises as an office for business activities carried on off the premises may have more employees than the limitation herein set forth if they are not employed on the premises. Home occupations with more than one (1) nonresident assistant or employee require a conditional use permit. One (1) additional off-street parking space shall be required above the normal parking requirements set forth in the Use Chart
17.70.030 for any home occupation where a nonresident employee works on the premises, and that employee's method of transportation to and from the site of the home occupation is a motor vehicle which would normally be parked on or near the site of the home occupation.
(5) Only one (1) flush-mounted, non-illuminated sign which is not more than two (2) square feet in area is permitted per dwelling unit. The sign shall show only the name of the occupant and type of occupation. A permit for the sign is required.
(6) If the home occupation is the type in which classes are held or instruction given, there shall be no more than four (4) students or pupils in the dwelling unit or on the premises at any one time, but the city planner may approve up to six (6) students if he or she finds that the additional students will not generate additional vehicular traffic. Home occupations involving more than six (6) students shall require a conditional use permit. These requirements limiting class size shall not be construed to prohibit occasional exceptions for recitals, demonstrations, and other similar gatherings. All classes with four (4) or more students shall be scheduled at least thirty (30) minutes apart to mitigate traffic congestion, but if the traffic associated with students coming to and going from classes is limited to a total of no more than six (6) vehicles during any period of sixty (60) consecutive minutes, then the classes need not be scheduled thirty (30) minutes apart.
(7) If the home occupation is the type in which clients or customers visit the premises, there shall be no more than six (6) clients or customers in the dwelling unit or on the premises during any period of sixty (60) consecutive minutes. Clients or customers of a home occupation shall be prohibited from visiting the premises between the hours of 12 o'clock midnight and 6 o'clock a.m. Traffic associated with clients or customers coming to or going from the premises shall be limited to a total of no more than four (4) vehicles during any period of sixty (60) consecutive minutes, but the city planner may approve up to six (6) such vehicles during any period of sixty (60) consecutive minutes after having considered the availability of on-site parking, traffic circulation
in the neighborhood, and the hours during which the home occupation is conducted. The requirements of this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit occasional exceptions for such events as meetings, conferences, demonstrations, or other similar gatherings.
(8) The total number of home occupations conducted within a dwelling unit or on its premises is not limited, except that the cumulative impact of all home occupations conducted within the dwelling unit or on its premises shall not be greater than the impact of one (1) home occupation.
(9) The regulations set forth in this Chapter shall not be construed as exempting home occupations from complying with all local, state, or federal regulations applicable to the activity pursued. (Ord. 03-33 §27, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.55.040 Nonconforming Home Occupations. A nonconforming home occupation is one which was lawfully established and maintained prior to April 2, 1985, but is no longer allowed because of the application of this Chapter as enacted by Ordinance No. 84-5 on March 24, 1985 and reenacted by this Title. Any nonconforming home occupation shall be discontinued. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

17.65.020 Unzoned Property. Any property within the city which for any reason does not have a district designation, shall be construed to be within the R1 district until classified by an amendment to the Official Zoning Map. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.65.030 Designation of Annexed Property.
(1) At Time Of Annexation. All land annexed to the city shall be classified at the time of annexation by ordinance into one (1) or more of the zone districts established by this Chapter.
(2) Preannexation. Whenever prior to annexation, an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan, to the text of this Title, or to the Official Zoning Map has been adopted by the city pursuant to RCW 35A.14.330 as now existing and in accordance with any amendments that may hereafter be made thereto, the amendment shall be effective upon the date of annexation as set forth in the annexation ordinance.
(3) Prezone Map. The location and boundaries of all prezone districts established by this Title are shown on the map entitled "Official Prezone Map of the City of Pullman." The prezone map and any amendments thereto shall be dated with their effective dates and signed by the mayor and finance director. This map is referred to as the "Official Prezone Map" and is adopted as a part of this Title by reference thereto. The district boundaries may be amended in accordance with Chapter 17.115 and such amendments shall also be adopted by reference as part of this Title.
(4) Recommendation of Planning Commission. Upon notification of any proposed annexation not already designated into a district on the Comprehensive Plan and Official Zoning Map, the planning commission shall review and, after holding a public hearing as set forth in Chapter 17.170, recommend to the City
Council, within one (1) year of such notification, a plan designation and zone district classification for the land involved in the annexation. Thereafter, the Council shall review the matter pursuant to Chapter 17.180. Action taken to assign a plan designation and zone district classification in this manner may occur before or after the property under consideration is annexed to the city. (Ord. 03-33 §29, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.65.040 Official Zoning Map. The location and boundaries of all districts established by this Title are as shown on the map entitled, "Official Zoning Map of The City of Pullman." The map and any amendments thereto shall be dated with their effective dates and signed by the mayor and finance director. This map is referred to as the "Official Zoning Map," and is adopted as a part of this Title by reference thereto. The district boundaries may be amended in accordance with Chapter 17.115 and such amendments shall also be adopted by reference as a part of this Title. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.65.050 Division of Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map may, for convenience, be divided into geographic parts, and each part may be further subdivided into units. Such parts and units may be separately designated for identification purposes when adopting or amending the Official Zoning Map or in any official reference to that map. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.65.060 Maintenance of Official Zoning Map and Amendments Thereto. The Official Zoning Map and any amendments thereto shall be certified by the finance director and shall be filed in the office of the finance director. The reproducible transparency of the original Official Zoning Map and any amendments thereto shall be maintained and updated by the city planner to show all amendments. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.65.070 Interpretation of Official Zoning Map. Where due to the scale, lack of detail, or illegibility of the Official Zoning Map there is uncertainty as to the location of any zone district boundary, the city planner shall upon the written request of any person make an interpretation, in writing, of the exact location of the boundary. Any person aggrieved by such an interpretation may appeal that interpretation to the board of adjustment. The city planner and the board of adjustment when interpreting the Official Zoning Map or deciding any appeal shall apply the following standards:
(1) Zone District Boundary Lines. Zone district boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines, and the centerlines of alleys, streets, rights-of-way, and watercourses, unless such boundary lines are fixed by dimensions shown on the Official Zoning Map.
(2) Vacated Streets, Alleys, or Public Ways. Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated, any zone district bounded by a side of such street, alley, or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of the vacated street, alley, or public way, and all of the area included in the vacation shall then be subject to the regulations of the extended districts.
(3) District Boundaries. Where district boundaries are shown as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the boundaries. If a district
boundary divides a lot into two (2) or more districts, the location of the boundary unless indicated by dimensions shown on the Official Zoning Map shall be determined by the use of the map scale shown thereon.
(4) Division of a Single Lot. Where a district boundary line as shown on the Official Zoning Map divides a parcel of property in single ownership at the time of the passage of this Title, the use permitted on the least restricted portion of that parcel may extend into the portion lying in the more restrictive district for a distance of no more than fifty (50) feet.

17.70.010 Use Chart Described. In Use Chart 17.70.030, land use classifications are listed on the vertical axis. City of Pullman underlying zone districts are shown on the horizontal axis. Also shown on the horizontal axis in the extreme right column are the number of required parking spaces for identified uses. The C2 district is exempt from these parking space requirements.
(1) If no symbol appears in the box at the intersection of a particular zone district and use, the use is not allowed in that district.
(2) If the symbol "P" appears in the box at the intersection of a particular district and use, the use is permitted outright.
(3) If the symbol "C" appears in the box at the intersection of a particular district and use, the use is permitted subject to the conditional use provisions of this Title.
(4) If the symbol "F" appears in the box at the intersection of a particular zone district and use, the use is permitted subject either to the Planned Residential Development provisions, or the Manufactured Home Park provisions or the Recreational Vehicle Park provisions of this Title.
(5) If a superscript number appears in the box at the intersection of a particular zone district and a use or parking requirement, the use or the parking requirement is subject to the special limitations indicated in the corresponding footnote. (Ord. 03-33 §30, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.70.020 Interpretation of Chart and Appeal.
(1) In the case of a question as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use in a particular use category, the city planner shall have the
authority to make the final determination. The city planner shall make the determination according to the characteristics of the operation of the proposed use.
EXAMPLES: A large sales office where business is conducted by telephone on the premises and where no goods other than samples come onto or go off of the premises, is an office rather than a retail or wholesale use. A shop selling items which are manufactured on the premises and the manufacturing process is not detectable from outside the building where the manufacturing occurs and the process requires no heavy trucking, is a retail use, not a manufacturing use.
(2) Unless otherwise identified in Use Chart 17.70.030 or elsewhere in this Title, the uses listed in the Use Chart are principal uses. In the case of a home occupation, defined in Chapter 17.55 as an accessory use of a dwelling unit, any business may be conducted so long as it complies with the standards set forth in Chapter 17.55. For example, a barber and beauty shop, as the principal use of a property, may operate only in commercial zone districts; however, a home occupation that provides barber and beauty shop services may operate in any residential zone district if said services meet the criteria established in Chapter 17.55.
(3) Appeal. Any aggrieved person may appeal a determination made by the city planner regarding Use Chart 17.70.030 to the board of adjustment as provided in Chapter 17.185. (Ord. 05-12 §1, 2005; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

(4) Airport Imaginary Surfaces. The following airport imaginary surfaces are established with relation to the airport and its runway. The size of each imaginary surface is based on the type of approach available or planned for each end of the runway. The slope and dimensions of the approach surface applied to each end of the runway are determined by the most precise approach existing or planned for that end of the runway.
(a) Horizontal Surface. A horizontal plane one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of the runway and connecting the adjacent arcs with lines tangent to them.
(b) Conical Surface. A surface extending upward and outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 (run to rise) for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
(c) Primary Surface. A five hundred (500) foot wide surface longitudinally centered on and extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as that of the nearest point on the runway centerline.
(d) Approach Surface. A surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. At the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport, there are two (2) approach surfaces, the inner edge of which begins at and is the same width and elevation as the primary surface.
(i) The larger than utility runway visual approach surface expands uniformly outward to a width of 1,500 feet and upward at a slope of 20:1 (run to rise) to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet beyond the end of the primary surface.
(ii) The larger than utility runway with a visibility minimum greater than 3/4 mile
nonprecision instrument approach surface expands uniformly outward to a width of 3,500 feet and upward at a slope of 34:1 (run to rise) to a horizontal distance 10,000 feet beyond the end of the primary surface.
(e) Transitional Surface. A surface extending outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7:1 (run to rise) from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal surface.
(5) Height. For the purposes of determining the height limits in the Airport Height Limitation Overlay Districts, the base datum shall be mean sea level, unless otherwise specified.
(6) Larger than Utility Runway. Any runway constructed and intended for use by propeller-driven aircraft of greater than 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight, or by jet aircraft.
(7) Nonprecision Instrument Runway. Any runway having an existing instrument approach procedure that utilizes air navigation facilities with only horizontal guidance, or area type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in nonprecision instrument approach has been approved or planned.
(8) Obstruction. Any structure or tree that exceeds the height limits established in 17.95.040 of this Chapter.
(9) Runway. Refers to Runway 5-23 at the Pullman-Moscow Regional Airport.

(i) compatibility with existing and planned land uses in the vicinity, and
(ii) adequacy of assurances that the MHP or RVP will be developed as presented in the application.
If the development calls for the construction of the MHP or RVP in phases, then the reasonableness of the schedule of phasing shall be considered. Each completed phase must independently of other phases of the development plan satisfy the development regulations of the approved MHP or RVP plan.
(e) Effect of Preliminary Approval. The preliminary plan as approved or approved as modified by the City Council shall be binding as to the general intent and apportionment of land for structures and buildings, stipulated use, circulation pattern, and conditions of approval, but shall not be construed to render inflexible the ultimate design, specific uses, or final plan of the MHP or RVP.
(f) Denied Preliminary Application. If the City Council denies a proposal contained in a preliminary application, a similar proposal for the site may not be submitted for one (1) year. A new preliminary application which varies materially from the denied proposal as determined by the city planner, or one that satisfies the objections stated by the City Council may be submitted at any time.
(3) Final Approval.
(a) Final Plan. Within three (3) years after approval of the preliminary proposal by the City Council, the applicant shall submit a final development plan to the city planner for approval by the City Council. The city planner shall review the plan and submit it to the Council along with his or her recommendation and the recommendation of the director. This plan shall contain final and precise drawings of all graphic information required by 17.105.060(2) and as preliminarily approved by the City Council. The applicant shall also submit all covenants, assurances, and any other documentation consistent with the preliminary approval given by the City Council.
(b) City Council Review. If the City Council finds that the final development plan conforms to the preliminary approval and all applicable conditions thereto, and assurances have been submitted which are satisfactory to the City Council, the Council shall approve the plan and its accompanying conditions as an amendment to the Official Zoning Map; and shall incorporate by reference all maps, drawings, and other data required to specify the precise land use authorized. This amendatory ordinance shall legally describe the boundaries of the approved MHP or RVP and shall bear the file number of the application. The official file shall be maintained by the department of public works and shall contain all maps and other documents or exhibits referred to or incorporated in the amendatory ordinance. The city clerk or finance director shall record the ordinance with the County Auditor if no subdivision plat is to be recorded. The MHP and RVP shall be identified on the Official Zoning Map by the suffix "MHP" and "RVP" respectively, attached to the zone designation for the underlying district (e.g. C3-MHP) and reference shall be made to the amendatory ordinance number.
(c) Effect of Approval. The provisions of the amendatory ordinance shall be restrictions on the use and design of the site. Adoption of the
amendatory ordinance shall not alter the underlying zone classification for the site but shall only allow development to occur in a different way consistent with the underlying zoning. Revocation of approval or abandonment as provided in this Chapter shall eliminate all requirements imposed by an approved MHP or RVP plan and shall cause the previous underlying zoning regulations to be exclusively operative.
(d) Expiration. If the applicant does not submit the final development plan to the city planner within the time allowed, or if the Council does not approve the final plan, the preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further validity. The City Council shall act on a final development plan for an MHP or RVP within ninety (90) days of its submission to the Council.
(e) Extension. Under the procedure set forth in 17.175.050(2) the applicant may file an application for an extension of time within the time allowed for submitting the final development plan, along with the fee as set by City Council resolution. The city planner may approve a single one (1) year extension by making a written finding that there is no material change in the proposal, and that the findings and conclusions of the preliminary approval still apply. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.105.070 Subdivision. An applicant who intends to subdivide land for transfer as part of an MHP or RVP project shall obtain subdivision approval in accordance with Chapter 13.80 or Chapter 13.90 before any building permit or authorization to begin construction is issued, and before any portion of the property is transferred. The preferred method is for the applicant to process the subdivision application concurrently with the MHP or RVP proposal. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.105.080 Changes to Approved Projects. An MHP or RVP shall be used and constructed only as approved. Any change in or expansion of an MHP or RVP, except as provided in this section, shall be applied for and processed in the same manner as an original application. Minor changes in plans or specifications may be allowed by the city planner under the
procedure of 17.175.050(2) at the time a building permit is issued. Minor changes are those which may affect the precise dimensions or siting of buildings, but which do not affect the basic character or arrangement of buildings or MH lots or RV sites approved in the final development plan, nor the density of the development or the open space requirements. (Ord. 05-12 §7, 2005; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.105.090 Revocation or Extension of Approval and Reversion to Underlying Zone.
(1) City Review. If a condition of approval is violated or not met within the time set for its completion, the Council may, either on recommendation of the city planner or on its own motion, a public meeting to consider the question of the revocation or extension of the final approval and any permits granted pursuant thereto. During this or a subsequent public meeting, the Council may by ordinance revoke or extend the approval and any permits, or may change the terms of approval. Nothing in this section shall limit the revocation of building permits, issuance of stop work orders, or other similar procedures authorized by other provisions of this Title.
(2) Reversion to Underlying Zoning. If upon the expiration of two (2) years from the adoption of the amendatory ordinance of approval, the MHP or RVP development project is voluntarily abandoned or development has not been completed, the final approval of the development project shall automatically expire and thereafter only the land use regulations of the underlying zone district shall apply to any further construction for which a permit is required. If the MHP or RVP development project has been commenced within a two (2) year period following the effective date of the amendatory ordinance, but is not completed within this two-year period, the applicant shall apply to the City Council for an extension of time in which to complete the project; failure to make such application shall cause the final approval of the development project to automatically expire and thereafter only the land use regulations of the underlying zone district shall apply to any further construction for which a permit is required. (Ord. 03-33 §40, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.105.100 Additional Regulations. The following chapters may qualify or supplement the regulations of this Chapter.

17.107.090 Additional Regulations
17.107.010 Purposes. The purposes of this Chapter are
(1) to provide the city with an alternative form of residential development which will promote flexibility and creativity in the layout and design of new residential developments and which will protect the environment through the increased use of open space.
(2) to provide an alternative to traditional lot-by-lot development by accomplishing, among other things, the following:
(a) the preservation of natural landscapes, trees, streams, or other valuable community amenities;
(b) the clustering of structures to preserve or create open spaces, especially where steep slopes or other environmentally sensitive areas exist;
(c) the provision of a more efficient street and utility system serving units in a cluster, thus lowering housing, land development, and maintenance costs and reducing the amount of impervious surfaces.
(3) to encourage the use of alternate energy sources and the construction of energy efficient structures, the development of recreational facilities and other development amenities by allowing increased density incentives. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.020 Where Permitted. Planned Residential Development (PRD) projects are permitted in any residential district when processed and authorized as provided in this Chapter. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.030 Uses Allowed. The following uses are allowed in a PRD:
(1) any use as set forth in Use Chart 17.70.030 allowed in the zone district in which the proposal is located;
(2) any service or trade uses designed primarily to serve the residents of the PRD with goods and services, provided the following conditions are complied with:
(a) only service or trade uses allowed under the C1 zone shall be permitted, but any proposed service or trade use not allowed in the C1 zone or is intended primarily to serve a population beyond the PRD shall require a zone and Comprehensive Plan change of the underlying zone and land use designation;
(b) the total area devoted to service or trade uses in the PRD shall not exceed five (5) percent of the total gross area of the PRD or 10,000 square feet, whichever is less. However, the planning commission may consider exceeding this limit where a need to do so is demonstrated by a competent market analysis. Seventy-five (75) percent of all residential building permits must have been issued before a building permit can be issued for a service or trade use. All development standards for these service or trade uses shall comply with C1 development regulations, unless provided otherwise by this Chapter. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.040 Development Standards. In considering a proposed PRD project the City Council may, if allowed in this section, approve a change from regular development regulations. Standards for the development of PRDs are as follows:
(1) PRD Size. The minimum size of a PRD shall be one (1) acre or five (5) lots, whichever is greater.
(2) Residential Density. The number of dwelling units allowed in a PRD shall be determined as follows:
(a) Basic Density. The number of dwelling units shall be calculated by dividing the net developable area by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the zone in which the site is located. Net developable area is determined by subtracting the area set aside for public streets and nonresidential uses such as schools, churches or service or trade uses from the total development area.
(b) PRD Bonus Density. An increase in residential density above the level established in 17.107.040(2)(a) shall be allowed at a rate of a one (1) percent increase in density for each density bonus point if a PRD incorporates the following features:
(i) Energy Conservation. Up to a maximum of five (5) density bonus points shall be awarded to any PRD incorporating any combination of the following energy conservation features:
(aa) Five (5) density bonus points shall be awarded if seventy (70) percent or more of all proposed structures intended for human occupancy have a calculated heating/ cooling energy consumption less than that required by the Washington State Energy Code standards;
(bb) Two and one-half (2-1/2) density bonus points shall be awarded if legally guaranteed solar access is provided to the south-facing surfaces of fifty (50) percent or more of all proposed structures that are intended for human occupancy;
(cc) Two and one-half (2-1/2) density bonus points shall be awarded if fifty (50) percent or more of all proposed structures intended for human occupancy derive fifty (50) percent or more of their space heating/cooling, water heating, or electrical power needs from active, passive, or photovoltaic solar systems; or
(dd) Two and one-half (2-1/2) density bonus points shall be awarded if natural
topography, grading, and planting are effectively used to decrease the energy consumption of structures in the PRD and to enhance the seasonal use of private or common open spaces.
(ii) Open Space. Up to a maximum of five (5) density bonus points shall be awarded to any PRD that provides more than the required open space. The amount of the bonus will be determined by the amount of additional open space reserved, with a one (1) percent bonus being awarded for each additional one (1) percent open space reserved.
(iii) Active Recreational Facilities. Up to a maximum of five (5) density bonus points shall be awarded to any PRD that provides for common, active recreational facilities such as a swimming pool, tennis court, or playground. These facilities shall be sized and designed to meet the needs of the PRD residents and their guests. The density bonus points awarded may range from one-half (1/2) point to five (5) points depending on the cost, quality, and quantity of the facility(ies).
(iv) Design Feature. Up to a maximum of five (5) density bonus points shall be awarded to any PRD incorporating two (2) or more of the following design elements:
(aa) on-site stormwater management using natural drainage channels and landscaped drainage retention facilities;
(bb) the preservation of significant natural vegetation or natural landmarks;
(cc) the preservation of significant historic sites or structures;
(dd) the preservation of significant view corridors, both on-site and especially for neighboring uses;
(ee) the provision of public access to significant natural landmarks, rivers, trails, scenic sites, or viewpoints; or
(ff) the provision of off-street pedestrian and bicycle circulation systems. Streets may be used as a part of a system for short distances where there is limited traffic.
(c) Maximum Residential Density Bonuses. If all of the provisions of 17.107.040(2)(b) are satisfied, a twenty (20) percent increase in residential density will be allowed. This maximum twenty (20) percent increase in density would result in the following lot area per dwelling unit ratios:
Zone District Square Feet per Dwelling Unit
R1 5,000
RT 3,750
R2 2,500
R3 1,250
R4 833
(3) Building Coverage. Coverage of the site by buildings and other structures shall not exceed the largest percentage permitted in any zone in which the project is located. The maximum building coverage in a PRD shall be the same as for the underlying zone district.
(4) Building Height. The maximum height of any building shall not exceed the height permitted in the zone district in which the PRD is located. If the proposal is to be located in zones with different height requirements, buildings located in each zone shall conform to the zone within which the building is located. If a building will be built in two (2) or more zone districts, the most restrictive height requirements shall apply.
(5) Minimum Required Yards.
(a) Exterior Boundary. The minimum distance between a building and the exterior boundary line of a PRD shall not be less than ten (10) feet except for a front yard which must be not less than fifteen (15) feet.
(b) Between Buildings. Buildings may have common walls except in the R1 zone district, and therefore may be built on an interior property line. Whenever buildings are separated, a
minimum distance of ten (10) feet shall be maintained between them.
(6) Common Open Space. A minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the net developable area as defined in 17.107.040(2)(a) shall be dedicated or reserved as usable common open space land. Common open space may be designed to provide either active or passive recreation. Driveways, parking lots, and minimum required yard areas are not open space.
(7) Private Open Space. Two hundred (200) square feet of usable private open space having a minimum depth of ten (10) feet shall be provided for each ground level dwelling unit in a PRD. Such private open space is to serve as a buffer between dwelling units and common open space.
(8) Off-street Parking. The total required off-street parking facilities shall not be less than the sum of the required parking facilities for the various uses computed separately in accordance with the provisions as set forth in Use Chart 17.70.030.
(9) Maintenance of Common Open Space and other PRD Facilities. Maintenance of common open space and other PRD facilities, including streets unless dedicated to the city, shall be the responsibility of a homeowners' association created as a nonprofit corporation. All owners of property in the PRD shall be members of the association. Provisions shall be made for the assessment, collection, and enforcement of collection of money to be used for the maintenance of common open space and other PRD facilities.
(10) Perimeter Transition. All projects shall give special treatment to perimeter transition so as to minimize negative impacts on adjacent areas through buffering, screening, and landscaping.
(11) Infrastructure. All streets; sidewalks, if built; utility mains; and attendant facilities for the PRD shall be constructed in accordance with the city of Pullman Design Standards unless alternate improvements are approved by the City Council.
17.107.050 Procedure for Approval and Effect of Approval. The PRD approval process shall take place in three (3) stages: pre-application review; review of preliminary plan; and final approval. PRD projects may be developed in phases, subject to an approved phasing schedule.
(1) Pre-Application Review. The pre-application plans of the proposal shall be submitted to the city planner for review and comment. Such potential problems as drainage, topography, circulation, site design, and neighborhood impact should be identified and addressed before the proposal is submitted for preliminary review.
(2) Review of Preliminary Plan.
(a) Application Requirements. The applicant shall submit the following material:
(i) A reproducible preliminary plan showing all information required for a preliminary plat by 13.80.080. The plan shall display the general layout of all proposed structures, common areas and facilities, and circulation elements including walkways, bike paths, and parking in sufficient detail to show relationships between these elements;
(ii) all information required for preliminary review of a subdivision by 13.80.060;
(iii) proposed covenants that prescribe architectural design elements for all structures to be built within the PRD, addressing such matters as general architectural style, building size, roof material and design, exterior surfaces, and accessory structures;
(iv) a map of the surrounding area in sufficient detail to show existing uses within three hundred (300) feet from all PRD project boundaries;
(v) explanatory material describing the characteristics of the PRD project and the planned construction schedule for the project;
(vi) a landscape plan drawn to scale which may be combined with the site plan showing the general layout of existing and proposed vegetation, including vegetation to be removed, as well as fences, walls, and other landscaping improvements.
(b) Review by Site Plan Review Committee. The SPRC shall review the proposal using the criteria of Chapter 17.135 and make recommendations to be considered by the planning commission and included in the planning commission's recommendation to the City Council.
(c) Planning Commission and City Council Review Procedure. The planning commission shall make recommendations and the City Council shall review the proposal as contained in the preliminary plan under the provisions of 17.180.030 and 17.180.040.
(d) Review Criteria. The planning commission and the City Council shall review the preliminary application for conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, this Title, Chapters 13.80 and 13.90 of this Code as now existing and in accordance with any amendments that may hereafter be made thereto, and the following additional criteria:
(i) compatibility with existing and planned land use in the vicinity, and
(ii) adequacy of assurances that the PRD will be developed as presented in the application.
If the development plan calls for the construction of the PRD in phases, then the reasonableness of the schedule of phasing shall be considered. Each completed phase must independently of other phases of the development plan satisfy the development regulations of the approved PRD plan.
(e) Effect of Preliminary Approval. The preliminary plan as approved or approved as modified by the City Council shall be binding as to the general intent and apportionment of land for structures and buildings, stipulated use, circulation pattern, and conditions of approval, but shall not be construed to render inflexible the ultimate design, specific uses, or final plan of the PRD.
(f) Denied Preliminary Applications. If the City Council denies a proposal contained in a preliminary application, a similar proposal for the site may not be submitted for one (1) year. A new preliminary application which varies
materially from the denied proposal, as determined by the city planner, or one that satisfies the objections stated by the City Council may be submitted at any time.
(3) Final Approval and Effect of Approval.
(a) Final Plan. Within three (3) years after approval of the preliminary proposal by the City Council, the applicant shall submit a final development plan to the city planner for approval by the City Council. The city planner shall review the plan and submit it to the Council along with his or her recommendation and the recommendation of the director. This plan shall contain final drawings of graphic information required by 17.107.050(2). The applicant shall also submit all covenants, assurances, homeowners' association papers, maintenance agreements, and any other documentation consistent with the preliminary approval given by the City Council.
(b) City Council Review. If the City Council finds that the final development plan conforms to the preliminary approval and all applicable conditions thereto, and assurances have been submitted which are satisfactory to the City Council, the Council shall approve the plan and its accompanying conditions as an amendment to the Official Zoning Map; and shall incorporate by reference all maps, drawings, and other data required to specify the precise land use authorized. This amendatory ordinance shall legally describe the boundaries of the approved PRD and shall bear the file number of the application. An official file shall be maintained by the department of public works and shall contain all maps and other documents or exhibits referred to or incorporated in the amendatory ordinance. The city clerk or finance director shall record the ordinance with the County Auditor if no subdivision plat is to be recorded. The PRD shall be identified on the Official Zoning Map by the suffix "PRD" attached to the zone designation for the underlying district (e.g., R3-PRD) and reference shall be made to the amendatory ordinance number.
(c) Effect of Approval. The provisions of the amendatory ordinance shall be restrictions on the use and design of the site. Adoption of the amendatory ordinance shall not alter the underlying zone classification for the site, but shall only allow development to occur in a different way consistent with the underlying zoning. Revocation of approval or abandonment as provided in this chapter shall eliminate all requirements imposed by an approved PRD plan and shall cause the previous underlying zoning regulations to be exclusively operative.
(d) Expiration. If the applicant does not submit the final development plan to the city planner within the time allowed, or if the Council does not approve the final plan, the preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further validity. The Council shall act on a final development plan for a PRD within ninety(90) days of its submission to the Council.
(e) Extension. Under the procedure set forth in 17.175.050(2), the applicant may file an application for an extension of time within the time allowed for submitting the final development plan, along with the fee as set by City Council resolution. The city planner may approve successive one (1) year extensions by making a written finding that there is no material change in the proposal, and that the findings and conclusions of the original preliminary approval still apply. (Ord. 03-33 §42, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.060 Subdivision. An applicant who intends to subdivide land for transfer as part of a PRD project shall obtain subdivision approval in accordance with Chapter 13.80 or Chapter 13.90 before any building permit or authorization to begin construction is issued, and before any portion of the property is transferred. The preferred method is for the applicant to process the subdivision application concurrently with the PRD proposal. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.070 Changes to Approved Projects. A PRD shall be used and constructed as approved by the Council. Any change in or expansion of a PRD, except as provided in this section, shall be applied for and processed in the same manner as an original
application. Minor changes in plans or specifications may be allowed by the city planner at the time a building permit is issued. Minor changes are those which may affect the precise dimensions or siting of buildings, but which do not affect the basic character or arrangement of buildings or lots approved in the final development plan, nor the density of the development or the open space requirements. Such dimensional adjustments shall not vary more than twenty (20) ten (10) percent from the original. (Ord. 03-33 §43, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.080 Revocation or Extension of Approval and Reversion to Underlying Zone.
(1) City Review. If a condition of approval is violated or not met within the time set for its completion the Council may, either on recommendation of the city planner or on its own motion, hold a public meeting to consider the question of the revocation or extension of the final approval and any permits granted pursuant thereto. During this or subsequent public meeting, the Council may by ordinance revoke or extend the approval and any permits, or may change the terms of approval. Nothing in this Section shall limit the revocation of building permits, issuance of stop work orders, or other similar procedures authorized by other provisions of this Title.
(2) Reversion to Underlying Zoning. If upon the expiration of two (2) years from the adoption of the amendatory ordinance of approval, the PRD project is voluntarily abandoned or development has not been completed, the final approval of the development project shall automatically expire and thereafter only the land use regulations of the underlying zone district shall apply to any further construction for which a permit is required. If the PRD project has been commenced within a two (2) year period following the effective date of the amendatory ordinance, but is not completed within this two-year period, the applicant shall apply to the City Council for an extension of time in which to complete the project; failure to make such application shall cause the final approval of the development project to automatically expire and thereafter only the land use regulations of the underlying zone district shall apply to any further construction for which a permit is required. (Ord. 03-33 §44, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.107.090 Additional Regulations. The following chapters may qualify or supplement the regulations in this Chapter.

(Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.108.050 Design Objectives. The following criteria should be considered in the design of townhouse developments:
(1) There should be an efficient and harmonious grouping of structures and space which encourages the individuality of separate townhouse dwelling units within a unifying design concept. The spacing between structures within the project should be compatible with spacing between structures in the surrounding neighborhood.
(2) Due consideration should be given to the impact of the townhouse development on the neighborhood or district in which the property is located. Development should be designed to minimize view obstruction.
(3) The design of the townhouse structures and overall site plan should be compatibile with the physical characteristics of the site, with buildings adjacent to the site, and with the character of the neighborhood or district. Design compatibility of buildings includes harmonious building style, form, size, color, materials and relationship to site topography. A compatible design plan is one which preserves the existing neighborhood character, facilitates efficient and convenient circulation, is functionally related to the natural topography, utilizes natural characteristics of the site, and is an asset to the community.
(4) Landscaping and buffering should be designed to present a pleasing appearance from both on and off the site.
(5) The natural vegetation and topography should be pre-served where such natural features contribute to the attractiveness of the project and compatibility with the neighborhood or district. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

17.115.030 "Limited" Zone
17.115.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth criteria for considering requests for rezones. This Chapter does not apply to the adoption of a new Official Zoning Map adopted in conjunction with the future enactment of a new Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.115.020 Planning Commission and City Council Review. The planning commission shall review a proposed rezone as provided in 17.180.030. The following questions shall be considered by the planning commission and City Council in reviewing a proposed rezone:
(1) Comprehensive Plan. Is the proposal consistent with the Comprehensive Plan at the time the decision is made on the proposed rezone request? No rezone may be approved unless a finding can be made that the proposed zoning is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map designation for the property.
(2) Zoning Ordinance. Is the proposal consistent with the purposes of the Zoning Code, and is the proposal consistent with the purposes of the proposed zone district?
(3) Surrounding Area. What is the relationship of the proposed zoning change to the existing land uses, and the zoning of surrounding or nearby property?
(4) Changes. Has there been sufficient change in the character of the surrounding or nearby area, or in city policy to justify the rezone?
(5) Suitability. Is the property economically and physically suitable for the uses allowed under the existing zoning, and under the proposed zoning? Consideration should be given to the length of time the property has remained undeveloped compared to the
surrounding area and other parcels in the city with the same zoning.
(6) Value. What is the relative gain to the public health, safety and welfare compared to a potential increase or decrease in value to the property owners?
(7) Error. Is the proposal necessary to correct an error?
(8) Compatibility. Are special conditions, pursuant to 17.115.030, necessary to achieve compatibility of development with surrounding properties?
(9) Special Criteria.
(a) Rezone Guidelines for C1 Zone District. Zone changes to create new neighborhood commercial districts or extend existing neighborhood commercial districts should follow these guidelines:
(i) separate C1 districts should not be located closer than one quarter (1/4) pedestrian mile from each other or within one quarter (1/4) pedestrian mile of any other commercial district in which similar services or facilities are provided;
(ii) C1 districts should not contain more than one (1) acre;
(iii) C1 districts should be located only along major, secondary, or collector arterials as identified in the circulation element of the Comprehensive Plan;
(iv) C1 districts should be limited to a four hundred (400) foot frontage along the arterial;
(v) C1 districts should be located where access to parking facilities and internal circulation patterns can be limited and coordinated so as not to be unreasonably disruptive to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow in the neighborhood.
(b) Rezone Guidelines for C2 Zone District. Zone changes to expand the C2 Central Business District should follow these guidelines:
(i) extensions of the C2 district should be contiguous to the existing C2 Central Business District;
(ii) C2 districts should be located along major or secondary arterials as identified in the circulation element of the Comprehensive Plan;
(iii) extensions of the C2 district should contain enough land to provide for a reasonable amount of on-site off-street parking considering the potential uses and land available.
(c) Rezone Guidelines for C3 District. Zone changes to create new general commercial districts or to extend existing general commercial districts should follow these guidelines:
(i) C3 districts should not be extended or created if there is adequate, available space for in-fill in existing C3 Districts;
(ii) extensions of C3 districts should be three (3) acres or larger whenever feasible;
(iii) new C3 districts should not be located within three-quarter (3/4) vehicular mile of an existing C3 District or any other district providing similar goods or services, and should contain at least ten (10) acres;
(iv) the width or frontage of any new C3 district, whenever feasible, should not be less than forty (40) percent of its length or depth;
(v) C3 districts should be located along major or secondary arterials as identified in the circulation element of the Comprehensive Plan;
(vi) C3 districts should be located where access to parking facilities and internal circulation patterns can be limited and coordinated so as to not be unreasonably disruptive to vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow.
(d) Rezone Guidelines for Industrial Districts. Zone changes to create new industrial districts should follow these guidelines:
(i) new Industrial Research Park (IRP) and Light Industrial (I1) districts should be no less than five (5) acres;
(ii) new Heavy Industrial (I2) districts should be no less than forty (40) acres. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.115.030 "Limited" Zone.
(1) Purpose. Any use permitted in any zone district should not be a detriment to the surrounding properties. The purpose of the "L" or "limited" zone district classification is to set forth standards when necessary which are intended to promote the compatibility of the uses permitted within each zone district.
The "limited" zone district classification creates a district with special conditions pertaining to the uses permitted in the "limited" zone district. The "limited" zone district classification cannot be petitioned for, but it may be recommended by the planning commission after study and review of a rezone request.
(2) Limiting Conditions in Any Zone District. Conditions limiting the uses or conduct of permitted uses may be required in any zone district or portion thereof where necessary to achieve compatibility of development with surrounding properties. Any zone or portion thereof where such conditions are required shall be established by ordinance and identified on the Official Zoning Map by the suffix "L" attached to its zone designation (e.g., "R3-L", "C1-L") and shall be referred to as a "limited" zone.
(3) Standards as Warranted. In recommending a "limited" zone district classification, the planning commission shall consider the unique circumstances and characteristics of a particular rezone request and the proposed land use.
These conditions may include reasonable limitations on the use and development of the property and a time limit for commencing the use or development of the property as specified in the rezoning ordinance. If a time limit is imposed by the City Council and the time limit has expired without commencement of the use or development, the land shall automatically revert to its previous zoning classification before the "limited" zone classification was granted, unless an extension of the time limit is authorized by the City Council prior to the expiration of the time limit. (Ord. 03-33 §46, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

17.125.030 General Requirements
17.125.040 Permit Conditions
17.125.050 Expansion of Approved Conditional Uses
17.125.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth criteria, procedures, and limitations for the issuance of conditional use permits. It is recognized that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular zoning district without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. These uses are called conditional uses. It is the intent and policy of the city of Pullman that such uses be dealt with in a manner that is equitable to the owner or applicant in terms of the interest of the city in securing public health, safety, and general welfare. When considering uses that are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the board of adjustment should consider the need to balance governmental regulations with free exercise claims. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.125.020 Criteria and Findings. A conditional use permit may be approved when all of the following findings required by this section can be made:
(1) that the proposed use is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;
(2) that the proposed use, and its location, are consistent with the purposes of the zone district in which the use is to be located;§
(3) that the proposed use will meet all required yard, parking, and other material development standards of the Zoning Code unless otherwise varied in the approved conditional use permit;
(4) that the use, as approved or conditionally approved, will
(a) be located on a site that is adequate in size and shape;
(b) be located on a site that has sufficient access to streets and highways adequate in width and type of surface to carry the quantity and quality of traffic generated by the proposed use;
(c) not have a significant adverse environmental impact on the adjacent area or the community in general;
(d) be compatible with surrounding land uses;
(e) be provided with adequate parking; and,
(f) be served by adequate public utilities and facilities. (Ord. 03-33 §48, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.125.025 Transferability. The board of adjustment at the time of the issuance of the conditional use permit shall determine whether the conditional use permit may or may not be used by a subsequent user of the same property or if the permit shall be personal. When the board of adjustment finds it appropriate, the board may require that the permit be recorded in the form of a covenant with the Whitman County Auditor. (Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.125.030 General Requirements. The following general requirements shall be applicable to all conditional use permits:
(1) The board shall review applications for conditional use permits as provided in 17.180.030, except conditional use permit applications in conjunction with an application for a Planned Residential Development, Manufactured Home Park, or Recreational Vehicle Park which shall be reviewed by the planning commission as provided in 17.180.030.
(2) Any person may appeal a board of adjustment decision to the Superior Court of Whitman County as provided in Chapter 17.185.
(3) An approved conditional use permit must be acted on by the permittee within one (1) year from its date of approval. Otherwise, the conditional use permit shall expire and be null and void, unless the permittee files an application for an extension of the time thirty (30) days before the expiration of the one (1) year period and the city planner approves the application.
(4) An application for any extension of time shall be
reviewed by the city planner as provided in 17.175.050.
(5) A conditional use permit applies only to the property for which it has been approved, and may not be transferred to any other property.
(6) A conditional use permit application shall be denied if the proposal cannot be conditioned so that the findings required by 17.125.020 can be made. (Ord. 03-33 §49, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.125.040 Permit Conditions. Approval of a conditional use permit application may be conditioned so that the required findings can be made. Permit conditions may include requirements which:
(1) increase the required lot size or yard dimensions;
(2) increase street widths;
(3) control the location and number of access points to the property;
(4) increase the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required;
(5) limit the number of signs;
(6) limit the coverage or height of buildings or structures because of obstructions to view, reduction of light and air to adjacent property, or incompatibility with surrounding uses;
(7) limit or prohibit openings in sides of buildings or structures or expand requirements for screening or landscaping where necessary to reduce noise and glare and maintain the property in a character in keeping with the surrounding area;
(8) establish requirements under which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the city and new conditions imposed; and,
(9) establish regulations for the use of the property as necessary to protect nearby property or improvements from detrimental effects of the proposed use, such as
limiting the hours of operation or number of employees. (Ord. 96-19 §4, 1996; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.125.050 Expansion of Approved Conditional Uses. By means of the procedure set forth in 17.175.050, the city planner may authorize up to a ten (10) percent expansion, in any five year period, of an approved conditional use in relation to its gross floor area, height, parking, and occupancy, including number of seats, classrooms, and students; provided, however, that no expansion of a structure by means of this procedure shall exceed 5,000 square feet in gross floor area. All such modifications shall be consistent with the original conditions of approval and applicable regulations. (Ord. 03-33 §70, 2003).

17.127.010 Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth criteria and procedures governing the issuance of special use permits for historic structures listed on a federal, state, or city registry of historic places. It is recognized that there are historic structures which were constructed for a special purpose, but due to changed circumstances can no longer be profitably or practically used for the use originally intended. In order to promote the preservation of these historic structures and allow "practical economic use," it is the intent and policy of the city that such structures may be considered for special use permits for historic structures. These permits, with such special exceptions as may be appropriate, may be issued for any appropriate use to encourage the preservation of historic structures; and, to promote their compatibility, to the greatest extent practicable, with surrounding properties and the underlying zone district. The provisions of this Chapter shall be liberally construed in favor of preserving historic structures. (Ord. No. 89-8 §1, 1989).

(1) that the structure is listed on a federal, state, or city registry of historic places;
(2) that the proposed use is reasonably necessary to preserve the historic integrity of the structure, considering its existing use and other uses allowed in the zone district in which it is located;
(3) that none of the uses designated for the underlying zone district as set forth in Use Chart 17.70.030 are likely to locate in the structure in a manner that would result in the preservation of the structure in a manner that would maintain its historic integrity;
(4) that the proposed use will be a "practical economic use" (i.e., a use which will be reasonably capable of supporting and maintaining the property in a manner that preserves its historic integrity);
(5) that the proposed use as approved or as approved with special exceptions will
(a) be located on a site that is adequate in size and shape;
(b) be located on a site that has access to streets and highways that are adequate in width and type of surface to carry the quantity and quality of traffic generated by the proposed use;
(c) not have significant adverse environmental impact resulting in excessive noise, light and glare, or soil erosion on adjacent properties as determined by the Responsible Official;
(d) be provided with parking availability that is adequate for the proposed use and which will not significantly adversely affect or interfere with the character or use of neighboring properties or the surrounding area;
(e) be served by adequate public utilities and facilities;
(6) that the owner of the property, in exchange for the benefits afforded by the special use permit, will enter into an agreement with the board of adjustment containing at least the following elements: (a) mutually agreeable maintenance standards; (b) assurances that the property will retain those characteristics that make it architecturally and historically significant; and (c) provisions for the agreement to run with the land. The agreement will be recorded by the city at the permittee's expense with the Whitman County Auditor. (Ord. 06-15 §5, 2006; Ord. 89-8 §3, 1989).
17.127.040 Permit Special Exceptions. A special use permit for a historic structure must satisfy the criteria set forth in 17.127.030. In order to do so, the following special exceptions may be granted:
(1) increase or decrease the required lot size or yard dimensions;
(2) increase or decrease street widths;
(3) control the location and number of access points to the property;
(4) increase or decrease the number and location of off-street parking and loading spaces required;
(5) limit or increase the number, type, and allowable square footage of signs;
(6) limit the coverage or height of buildings because of obstructions to view and reduction of light or air to adjacent property;
(7) limit or prohibit openings in sides of buildings or structures or expand requirements for screening or landscaping where necessary to reduce noise and glare and maintain the property in a character in keeping with the surrounding area;
(8) establish requirements under which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the city and new conditions imposed; and,
(9) establish regulations for the use of the property as necessary to protect nearby property or improvements from detrimental effects of the proposed use, such as limiting the hours of operation or number of employees. (Ord. No. 89-8 §4, 1989).
17.127.050 General Requirements. The following general requirements apply to all special use permits for historic structures:
(1) The board of adjustment shall review, as provided in 17.180.030, applications for special use permits for historic structures.
(2) Any aggrieved person may appeal a board of adjustment decision to the Superior Court of Whitman County as provided in Chapter 17.185.

Otherwise, the special use permit shall expire and be null and void after that time unless the permittee applies in writing to the city planner for an extension of time at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the one-year period, setting forth the reasons for the extension; and, the city planner finds that good cause exists for the extension and approves the application.
(4) An application for any extension of time shall be reviewed by the city planner as provided in 17.175.050.
(5) If the use for which the permit was granted is abandoned for a period of one (1) year, the use may not be reinstated without the issuance of a new special use permit.
(6) If the permittee or a subsequent owner of the structure fails to maintain or improve the property in accordance with the special use permit and the agreement with the city, the board of adjustment may revoke the special use permit after holding a public meeting.
(7) The permit may not be transferred to any other property, but may be transferred to subsequent owners of the property for which the permit was issued.
(8) The special exceptions may be amended by the board of adjustment using the procedures set forth in this Chapter for obtaining an original special use permit
for historic structures. (Ord. 03-33 §50, 2003; Ord. No. 89-8 §5, 1989).

(10) Conformance with Approved Site Plan. Conformance with the conditions of any approved site plan shall be determined at the time of final inspection of the last structure to be inspected, and prior to issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. A final certificate of occupancy shall be issued only when all conditions of the approved site plan have been satisfied.
(11) Amendment of Site Plan. A site plan application approved by the director or by the board of adjustment may be amended following the same procedures set forth in this Chapter for obtaining original site plan approval, provided, however, that if final approval of an original site plan was given by the board then final action on the amendment shall be made by the board.

(Ord. 07-9 §1, 2007; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).

17.185.030 Appeal Procedure.
(1) Written Appeal. Appeals shall be written and shall include the following:
(a) the name of the project applicant and the date of the decision, or the name of the person who has received a Notice to Abate under 5.01.080 and the
date of the notice;
(b) the name and address of the person appealing, and his or her interest in the matter;
(c) a brief statement of the specific action being appealed, together with any material facts claimed to support the contentions of the appellant;
(d) a brief statement of the relief sought and the reasons why it is claimed the action appealed from should be reversed, modified, or otherwise set aside;
(e) regarding actions pertinent to Title 17, a list of property owners as specified in 17.170.020(1)(a) if no public hearing has been held earlier; and
(f) an appeal fee established pursuant to 17.10.060.
(2) Filing the Appeal.
(a) In actions arising under Title 17, the appellant shall file an appeal with the planning department within ten (10) days after the date of the decision being appealed.
(b) In actions arising under Title 5, the appellant shall file an appeal with the City Clerk within five (5) days after the date of the Notice of Abate.
(3) Rejection of Appeal. If an appeal is not properly filed because one or more of the required materials set forth in 17.185.030(1) has not been submitted within the time limit established in 17.185.030(2), the city administrator or his/her designee has the authority to reject the appeal. In such instances, the city administrator or designee shall inform the appellant in writing that the appeal has been rejected and include an explanation of its deficiency(ies).
(4) Stay of Proceedings. If an appeal is properly filed within the time limit, the appealed decision shall be suspended, and no further action which is the subject of the appeal may be taken until the appeal is decided, but if a suspension would cause imminent peril to life or property, development action may be continued only by an order issued by the board or by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the City’s authority to proceed with summary abatement under 5.01.120.
(5) Department Action.
(a) If an appeal related to Title 17, Zoning, is properly filed within the time limit, the city planner shall:
(i) set the hearing on the appeal for a date that is within ninety (90) days of the date the appeal was filed;
(ii) give notice of the hearing as specified in 17.170.020; and,
(iii) provide the board of adjustment with copies of the staff report, minutes if any, the decision, a preliminary response to the appeal, and other relevant material. The project applicant, appellant, and other interested parties who have made requests to the planning department shall be notified in writing when these materials are filed and that they may be reviewed and/or copied at the expense of the persons wishing to do so.
(b) If an appeal related to Title 5, Health and Sanitation, is properly filed within the time limit, the City shall set the date and give notice of hearing on the appeal for the earliest practicable date, but not more than thirty (30) calendar days from the date the written appeal was filed.
(6) Board of Adjustment Review.
(a) On matters related to Title 17, Zoning:
(i) The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on the appeal in the manner provided in Chapter 17.170.
(ii) The board shall base its decision on the same standards and criteria set forth in this Title for the original decision.
(iii) The board may affirm, modify, or reverse the action of the staff.
(iv) The decision of the board shall include any conditions placed on the approval if
approval is granted.
(v) The decision of the board shall be final and conclusive, unless within twenty-one (21) days from the date of the decision the project applicant, appellant, or an aggrieved person files with the Superior Court of Whitman County a land use petition in accordance with R.C.W. 36.70C, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended.
(vi) Decisions of the director made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 17.100 shall require the concurring vote of four (4) members of the board to reverse or modify such a decision of the director.
(b) On matters related to Title 5, Health and Sanitation:
(i) The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on the appeal of the Notice to Abate under the procedures established in 17.170.030, except as stated in this section. The board may affirm, modify, or reverse the Notice to Abate.
(ii) The City shall have the burden of proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred and that the required corrective action is reasonable.
(iii) The determination of the applicable responsible official as to the need for the required corrective action shall be accorded substantial weight by the board of adjustment in determining the reasonableness of the required corrective action.
(iv) If the board of adjustment determines that a violation of Title 5 has occurred, the board shall issue an Order to the person responsible for the violation which contains the following:
(a) The board’s decision on the Notice to Abate, including findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision.
(b) The required corrective action, with any modifications expressly stated.
(c) The date and time at which the City may proceed with abatement of the violation if the required corrective action is not completed.
(d) A copy of the board’s Order shall be sent via U.S. Mail to the last known owner as listed in the tax records of Whitman County, if the owner is not a party to the appeal.
(Ord. Nos. 18-25 §28, 2018; 07-9 §3, 2007; Ord. 03-33 §66, 2003; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
17.185.040 Court Review. Unless otherwise provided by law, any final decision or other final action for which no other direct appeal is specifically provided in this Title and for which all other appeals specifically authorized have been timely exhausted shall be reviewable by the Superior Court of Whitman County by filing a land use petition pursuant to R.C.W. 36.70C, as it now exists or may hereafter be amended. The action may be brought by any aggrieved person by filing said land use petition within twenty-one (21) days from any final decision or other final action to be reviewed. The appellant shall bear the cost of transcribing and reproducing all records ordered certified by the court for such review. (Ord. 03-33 §67, 2003; Ord. 00-22 §1, 2000; Ord. 87-9 §1, 1987).
