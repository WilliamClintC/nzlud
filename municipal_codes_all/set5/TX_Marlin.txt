5-100. Intent.
Within	the	districts	established	by	this	Ordinance	or	- amendments that may later be adopted, there exist:
1.	Lots,
2.	Structures,
3.	Uses of land and structures, or
4.	Characteristics  of  use
·-vhich were lawful before  this Ordinance was passed or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendment. It is the intent of this Ordinance  to  permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as the grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.

APPENDIX A-ZONING	Art. 5
 
'.· .	A nonconforming  use of a structure, a nonconforming use
of land or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged by any of the following by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises or by'..the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
To avoid undue hardship,  nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was	lawfully	begun	prior	to	the  effective	date   of  this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been	carried  on  diligently.  Actual  construction  is  hereby defined		to	be		the		placing		of		construction	materials	in permanent  position  and  fastened  in  a  permanent  manner. Where	excavation,	demolition  or  removal	of  an  existing . building		has  · been  ·substantially	begun	preparatory	to rebuilding,  such  excavation  or demolition  or removal  and new construction shall be carried on diligently and without interruption.

5-200. Nonconforming lots of record.
In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.
If  two  or more  lots  or  portions  of  lots with  continuous frontage  in single ownership  are of record  on the effective
1595
 
Art. 5	MARLIN CODE

date of this Ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the  requirements established for  lot width  and  area, the lands involved shall be considered  to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Ordinance. No portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width  and area requirements estab- lished by this Ordinance. No division of any parcel may be made which creates a lot with depth, width or area less than the requirements stated in this Ordinance.
5-300. Nonconforming	uses	of	land	{or land	with minor structures only).
Where at the time of passage of this Ordinance lawful u e of land exists which would not be permitted  by  the regulations imposed by this Ordinance and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000.00, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:
a.	No	such   nonconforming	use	shall  be	enlarged	or increased  nor  extended  to  occupy  a  greater  area  of
 

·:.·_._;_:·_ :_. ··.
...j
 
land	than	was	occupied	at	the	effective	date	of	·.- adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
b.	No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance;
c.	If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conforni to the regulations specified by this Ordinance for the district in which such land is located;
d.	No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.

built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason or restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the . lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a.	No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way  which  increases  its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity;
b.	Should such nonconforming structure or nonconform­ ing portion  of  structure  be  destroyed  by  any means to  an  extent  of  more than fifty percent  (50%)  of its
...replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance;
c.	Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which  it is located after it is moved.

5-500. Nonconforming uses of structures or of struc­ tures and premises in combination.
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more or of structures and premises in combination exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a.	No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstruct­ ed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of  the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
b.	Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any   parts   of   a   building   which   were   manifestly

1597
 
Art. 5	MARLIN CODE
 

.......... . .
 
arranged  or  designed · for  such  use  at  the  time  of	··... adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, but no such
use sall be extended to occupy any land outside such building;
c.	If 'no structural alterations are made, any nonconform­ ing use of a structure, or  structure  and  premises, may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropri­ ate to the district than the existing nonconforming useJ. In permitting such change the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate  conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this Ordinance;
d.	Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a   permitted   use   shall  thereaf ter  conform  to  the
regulations for the district, and the nonconforming  use	.  i
may not thereafter be resumed;	'
e.	When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises . in · combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) consecutive months or for eighteen (18) months during any three (3) year period (except when governmet .action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
f. Where nonconforming use status applied to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty percent (50%) (or other figure) of the replacement cost at time of destruction.

1598
 
APPENDIX  A-ZONING	Art. 5

5-600. Repairs and maintenance.
On any nonconforming  structure or portion of a structure· containing a nonconforming  use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs or  on repair  or replacement  of  nonbearing  walls,  fixtures, wiring, or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure  or  nonconforming  portion  of the structure as the case may [be], provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.

If a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlaful due to lack of repairs and maintenance and is declared by  any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawf ul by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the
i
(		strengthening	·or	restoring	to	a	safe	condition	of	any building  or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the public safety upon order of such official.

5-700. Uses  under	special  exception  provisions  not nonconforming  uses.
Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district · under the terms of this Ordince (other than a change through Board of Adjustment action · from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming  use in such district but shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use.
