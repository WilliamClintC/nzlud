If such entry is refused, the director of planning and community development shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing entry without a search warrant if a warrant is legally required.

The city council designates the appointive offices and employments listed within this chapter as requiring confirmation by the city council. The qualifications for these offices and employment shall be determined by the mayor subject to any statutory requirements or qualifications, unless such qualifications would conflict with bargaining unit work established under any applicable collective bargaining agreement. The positions designated by this chapter are at will and the officers who hold them may be removed at the discretion of the mayor. The salaries for such positions are established and revised by the city’s annual salary ordinance adopted as part of its budget unless a specific employment agreement has been approved by the city council. (Ord. 1971 § 2, 2019).

A. City clerk;

C. Police chief;

D. Community development director;

E. Public works director;

F. City attorney; provided, however, that in accordance with the provisions of RCW 35A.12.020 the city may contract with rather than employ a city attorney. In that event, the city council will confirm the appointment by approval of a contract for services. (Ord. 1971 § 2, 2019).


2.82.030 Unfilled positions – Temporary authorization.

Recognizing that vacancies will occur from time to time and that the city’s ultimate goal is an efficient functioning of government and the provision of municipal services, the city council authorizes the mayor to make temporary or interim appointments in the event of vacancy in any of the positions designated in MMC 2.82.020. The mayor shall notify the city council in a timely manner of any vacancies and her/his provision for interim appointments to cover the duties of these positions either by delegation, interim hiring or professional service agreement. In no event shall an interim appointment extend beyond 90 days without the express approval of the city council. (Ord. 1971 § 2, 2019).


2.82.040 Salaries and benefits.

The salaries and benefits for all offices and positions in the city including the appointive offices referenced in this chapter shall be established annually in the city’s budget process. No salary or other form of compensation shall be paid to an appointive officer or to any employee unless specifically authorized by the annual salary ordinance by a collective bargaining agreement or by an individual employment contract approved by the city council in the normal course of its business. (Ord. 1971 § 2, 2019).


2.82.050 Delegations of authority.

The mayor is the chief executive administrative officer of the city in charge of all departments, offices and employees and has the authority to designate assistants and department heads. The mayor is authorized to delegate authority among the department heads and offices in accordance with state statute and the limitations established by the annual budget ordinance. The designation of a specific officer or employee to perform any function within this code may, at the discretion of the mayor, be delegated to another position or city officer so long as such delegation is permitted by state statute.

Investments shall be as follows:

This chapter constitutes the city’s rules and regulations to carry out and implement the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.020 Public records officer.

The city clerk shall serve as the city’s public records officer. Contact information for the city clerk will be made available to the public in a manner reasonably calculated to provide notice of to whom members of the public may direct requests, such as posting such contact information at City Hall or on the city’s Internet website. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.030 Maintenance of records.

A. All substantive and procedural rules of general applicability, including but not limited to ordinances and resolutions of the city council, minutes of the regular meetings of the city council, and statements of general policy, and all public contracts, deeds, easements and leases, shall be indexed and maintained by the city clerk.

B. All police records shall be maintained in the Milton police department. Access to police records shall be in accordance with the policy established by the police department, pursuant to laws including but not limited to Chapter 10.97 RCW, Washington State Criminal Records Privacy Act, and Chapter 13.50 RCW, Keeping and Release of Records by Juvenile Justice or Care Agencies.

C. All other such records of the city relating to the specific function or responsibility of a particular department shall be maintained for the use of the department and the general public in the office of the particular department. Such records shall include, but not be limited to: planning policies and goals, and interim and final planning decisions; factual staff reports and studies; factual consultant’s reports and studies; scientific reports and studies; and any other factual information derived from tests, studies, reports or surveys, whether conducted by city employees or others. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.040 Index of public records – Findings.

A. The Public Records Act requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

B. RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that an agency need not maintain such an index if to do so would be unduly burdensome, but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome or would interfere with agency operations.

C. The city is comprised of numerous departments, their divisions and subdivisions, many if not all of which maintain separate databases and/or systems for the indexing of records and information.

D. Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems, formats and/or databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a current index of all records. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.050 Index of public records – Order.

Based upon the findings set forth in MMC 2.92.040, and pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the city council orders the following:

A. The city is not required to maintain an all-inclusive index of public records due to the undue burden and near-impossibility of maintaining such an index.

B. The city will make available for inspection and/or copying all public records, including any indexes that are maintained by the city as set forth in MMC 2.92.030, except to the extent that such records are exempt from public disclosure. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.060 Disclosure of public records.

Unless exempt from disclosure under this chapter or other law, public records shall be available for inspection and copying in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.070 Procedure for inspection or copying.

A. Requests to inspect and copy public records shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the city clerk and shall identify the public records sought for such inspection and copying. The city clerk shall create and avail for public use a standard form by which a requestor may specify particular public records and provide the requestor’s relevant contact information. Reasonable assistance as may be necessary to help a requestor locate particular records shall be provided either by the city clerk or by the city department maintaining the records; provided, that the provision of such assistance shall not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the city clerk, the department, or the assisting employee.

B. Requests for public records shall be submitted to the city clerk at 1000 Laurel Street, Milton, Washington 98354, or his or her designee, or online through the city’s website, except as otherwise provided herein. 

C. Each city department may designate within its own department certain “over the counter” records available to the public for immediate inspection without the requirement of a formal public records request as set forth in this section. 

D. Except to the extent required or authorized by law, the city clerk or other city employee shall not distinguish among persons requesting records. Persons requesting records shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request, except to establish whether the inspection or copying would violate Chapter 42.56 RCW or other statute or ordinance that exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to certain persons. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.080 Processing of records requests – Review of decision.

A. Responses to requests for public records shall be made promptly pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW. Within five business days of the date of receipt by the city of a written request for a record, the city clerk shall:

1. Provide the record; or

2. Acknowledge that the city has received the request and provide a reasonable estimate of the time the city will require to respond to the request, or request clarification; or

3. Deny the public record request in whole or in part.

B. Public records may be made available on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of requested records are assembled or made ready for public inspection or copying. Additional time to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify the intent of the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt. If a public records request is unclear, the city clerk may ask the requestor to clarify what information the requestor is requesting. If the requestor fails to clarify the request, the city need not further respond to or process the request.

C. If the city clerk determines that the document is exempt in part but can be made available after deletion of exempt portions, the request shall be granted; provided, that such exempt portions shall first be deleted. If the city clerk determines to deny the request, in whole or in part, a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial shall be provided to the requestor; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the city to disclose portions of a requested document if the entire document is exempt from disclosure.

D. In the event the city clerk denies inspection of all or any part of a request, the city clerk may seek review by the city attorney. The city clerk will notify the requestor by mail of the decision to grant or deny the request. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.090 Inspection of records.

In the event a requestor chooses to inspect records, the city shall notify the requestor once the records responsive to the request are available for inspection. The records will be available for inspection during customary office hours. Records that have been pulled for inspection shall be made available to the requestor for a period of no more than 14 calendar days. In the event a requestor fails to contact the city clerk, or his or her designee, within 14 calendar days of being notified that the records are available for inspection: (A) the request shall be deemed abandoned; and (B) the records shall be returned to the originating department. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.100 Records subject to disclosure – Public records not sufficiently identified.

The city will disclose records to the extent required by state or federal law and nothing in this policy shall be interpreted as requiring the disclosure of any record that is not subject to disclosure by state or federal law. Generally, any record, or portion thereof, which is exempt from disclosure, will not be disclosed, and information contained in the records may be removed to the extent necessary or permissible by law. Requests for information or for inspection and copying of public records which require city employees to compile information, perform research, require reformatting of data, or which do not otherwise sufficiently identify a record are not considered a request under the Public Records Act or this chapter. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.110 Denial of request – Appeal.

Denials of all or any portion of a request must be accompanied by a written statement of the specific reasons therefor. In the event that the city clerk denies a request for public records, the requestor may appeal the denial to the city attorney. Such review shall be conducted as promptly as reasonably possible and shall constitute final action for the purposes of judicial review. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.120 Electronically stored data and information.

Public records in the form of information or data which is electronically stored (on the memory of a computer, a diskette, a magnetic tape, a compact disc or in other similar ways) shall be subject to public inspection and copying in the following manner:

A. Information or data that is publicly available by computer access without submission of a request for inspection and copying may be inspected and copied by any person or persons having access to computer equipment capable of such inspection and copying. Subject to budget and financial constraints, public access computer equipment may be made available without charge by the city at public locations.

B. Information or data that is not publicly available by computer access without submission of a request for inspection and copying, but which constitutes public records and is stored, contained or available as data or information within the memory or storage facilities of computer or electronic equipment, is subject to inspection and copying only with the cooperative services of city employees familiar with the operation of equipment that permits such inspection and copying to occur. When public records are adequately identified by the requestor, a city employee designated by the city clerk or other appropriate department director shall examine the information to determine if it contains exempt records. If such examination reveals any data or information that is exempt from public inspection and copying, the requested public record shall be printed on paper or transferred to a diskette or similar medium with the exempt portions thereof deleted. If the examination reveals no exempt information, the person requesting inspection and copying, at his or her option, may either view the information on a computer screen, have the information transferred to a diskette or other compatible storage medium, or ask that the information be printed on paper; provided, however, that the viewing of such information on a computer screen shall not be permitted except where the computer is operated by a city employee and where diverting such city employee from his or her regular duties in order to operate such computer to permit such viewing would not cause excessive interference with essential functions of the city. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.130 Exemptions.

The city adopts by reference the exemptions from public disclosure contained in Chapter 42.56 RCW, including any future amendments thereto or recodification thereof, along with any other exemption or exception to the Public Records Act provided by law, including but not limited to those exemptions set forth in Appendix C to “Public Records Act for Washington Cities and Counties,” Municipal Research and Services Center, Report No. 61, May 2007, as may be amended from time to time, a copy of which shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk. (Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).


2.92.140 Reimbursement of copying costs. 

A. No fee shall be charged for the inspection of public records or locating public documents and making them available for copying, except as provided in RCW 42.56.240(14) and subsection C of this section. A reasonable charge may be imposed for providing copies of public records and for the use by any person of city equipment to copy public records, which charges shall not exceed the amount necessary to reimburse the city for its actual costs directly incident to such copying. When calculating any fees authorized under this section, the city shall use the most reasonable cost-efficient method available to the city as part of its normal operations. If the city translates a record into an alternative electronic format at the request of a requestor, the copy created does not constitute a new public record for purposes of this chapter. Scanning paper records to make electronic copies of such records is a method of copying paper records and does not amount to the creation of a new public record.

B. 1. City charges for actual costs may only be imposed in accordance with the costs established and published by the city pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(7), and in accordance with the statement of factors and manner used to determine the actual costs. In no event may the city charge a per page cost greater than the actual cost as established and published by the city.

2. The city need not calculate the actual costs it charges for providing public records if it has rules or regulations declaring the reasons doing so would be unduly burdensome. To the extent the city has not determined the actual costs of copying public records, the city will charge:

a. Fifteen cents per page for photocopies of public records, printed copies of electronic public records when requested by the person requesting records, or for the use of city equipment to photocopy public records;

b. Ten cents per page for public records scanned into an electronic format or for the use of city equipment to scan the records;

c. Five cents per each four electronic files or attachment uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage service, or other means of electronic delivery;

d. Ten cents per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of city equipment to send the records electronically. The city shall take reasonable steps to provide the records in the most efficient manner available to the city in its normal operations; and

e. The actual cost of any digital storage media or device provided by the city, the actual cost of any container or envelope used to mail the copies to the requestor, and the actual postage or delivery charge.

3. The charges in subsection (B)(2) of this section may be combined to the extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response to a particular request.

4. The city may charge a flat fee of up to $2.00 for any request as an alternative to fees authorized under subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section when the city reasonably estimates and documents that the costs allowed under this subsection are clearly equal to or more than $2.00. An additional flat fee shall not be charged for any installment after the first installment of a request produced in installments. If the city has elected to charge the flat fee in this subsection for an initial installment, then it may not charge the fees authorized under subsection (B)(1) or (2) of this section on subsequent installments.

5. The city shall not impose copying charges under this section for access to or downloading of records that the city routinely posts on its public internet website prior to receipt of a request unless the requestor has specifically requested that the city provide copies of such records through other means.

6. A requestor may ask the city to provide, and if requested the city shall provide, a summary of the applicable charges before any copies are made and the requestor may revise the request to reduce the number of copies to be made and reduce the applicable charges.

C. 1. a. In addition to the charge imposed for providing copies of public records and for the use by any person of city equipment copying costs, the city may include a customized service charge. A customized service charge may only be imposed if the city estimates that the request would require the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations, or provide customized electronic access services when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the city for other city purposes.

b. The customized service charge may reimburse the city up to the actual cost of providing the services in this subsection.

2. The city may not assess a customized service charge unless the city has notified the requestor of the customized service charge to be applied to the request, including an explanation of why the customized service charge applies, a description of the specific expertise, and a reasonable estimate cost of the charge. The notice also must provide the requestor the opportunity to amend his or her request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a customized service charge.

D. The city may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request, including a customized service charge. If the city makes a request available on a partial or installment basis, the city may charge for each part of the request as it is provided. If an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. The city may waive any charge assessed for a request pursuant to city rules and regulations. The city may enter into any contract, memorandum of understanding, or other agreement with a requestor that provides an alternative fee arrangement to the charges authorized in this section, or in response to a voluminous or frequently occurring request. (Ord. 1924 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1720 § 1, 2008).

In the event that any official or employee fails or refuses to comply with any of the conditions of MMC 2.96.050, or elects to provide his/her own representation with respect to any such claim or litigation, then all of the provisions of this chapter shall be inapplicable, and have no force or effect with respect to any such claim or litigation. (Ord. 1152 § 7, 1991).


2.96.080 Reimbursement of incurred expenses.

The city shall pay any attorneys’ fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is covered by the provisions of this chapter.

Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to modify or amend any provision of any policy of insurance where any city official or employee thereof is insured. In the event of any conflict between this chapter and the provisions of any such policy of insurance, the policy provisions shall be controlling; it being the intent of this chapter and section to provide the coverage detailed in this chapter outside insurance policies which may be in effect, while not compromising the terms and conditions of such policies by any conflicting provision contained in this chapter. (Ord. 1152 § 9, 1991).

Chapter 3.52 CONTRACT APPROVALS

Sections:

The following procedure is hereby established for the approval of certain contracts and granting the city administrator or mayor authority with respect to such contracts:

A. The city council authorizes the city administrator or mayor to enter into and execute on behalf of the city the following contracts without individual approval of each contract by the city council, provided the contract is consistent with the approved annual budget for the city and the city’s liability under the contract does not exceed available fund balances:

1. All contracts involving a cost or fee (including sales tax) that does not exceed $25,000, refer to the city’s purchasing policy.

2. Public works projects involving a cost or fee of less than $65,000 involving multiple trades, and $40,000 involving a single trade.

3. Sale of unneeded surplus personal property with an estimated cumulative value of $20,000 or less which the council has declared surplus by resolution after holding any required hearing, such sale or disposition to be made by the city administrator or mayor in accordance with informal procedures and in the best interest of the city.

4. Contracts that are not otherwise identified in this chapter that carry out or implement a provision of the Milton Municipal Code or established city policy (e.g., maintenance or performance bonds for plat improvements).

5. Emergency contracts. “Emergency” means a set of unforeseen circumstances that either:

a. Present a real, immediate threat to the proper performance of essential functions; or

b. Will likely result in material loss or damage to property, bodily injury, or loss of life if immediate action is not taken.

6. Employment and personnel matters. Unless otherwise provided by statute or ordinance (e.g., salaries and compensation are subject to city ordinance).

B. The breaking down of any purchase or contract into units or phases for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount is prohibited. The amount of a contract includes all amendments; provided, however, amendments that do not exceed in total 10 percent of the contract amount may be entered into without prior city council approval.

C. The city administrator or mayor may present any contract to the city council for prior approval, even if the contract is allowed to be approved without prior city council approval.

D. All interlocal agreements, other than service agreements with a cost of service that does not exceed $25,000 per year, shall be presented to the city council for prior approval.

E. The city administrator or mayor shall promptly, within 10 days, provide to the city council a copy (or summary) of any contract (or amendment) that has not received prior approval by the city council.

F. Amendments and Change Orders.

1. Amendments or change orders to contracts requiring city council approval under this chapter may be administratively approved by the city administrator or mayor if the changes are:

a. Within the scope of the project;

b. Consistent with an initial bid process, if any;

c. Executed in writing; and

d. An increase of the contract award amount (CAA) as follows:

	Contract Award Amount	Percentage Increase in CAA (the greater of)	Limits

	Less than $100,000	30% or minimum	Min. $0

	Max. $30,000

	$100,000 to $500,000	20% or minimum	Min. $30,000

	Max. $100,000

	Greater than $500,000	10% or minimum	Min. $100,000

	Max. $200,000

2. The value of all change orders will be aggregated. When any single change order, or combined change orders on the same project or single purchase, exceeds the value limit, the change must be approved by the city council, except in the following instances:

a. On service contracts used to accomplish an ongoing city program as opposed to completing a short-term project or purchase, change order rules, including the aggregate rule, shall be applied on an annual basis.

b. Where the size of the contract and the exhausting of change order authority make further change order authorization impractical, the city council may, upon recommendation of the mayor, extend the aggregate limits of subsection A of this section for specific contracts.

3. A work change directive may be used to:

a. Authorize and direct work that will result in an increase in contract price within the administrative authority of the city administrator or mayor as provided in subsection A of this section for specific contracts. Work change directives that affect the contract price shall be incorporated into a change order.

b. Authorize and direct work that will result in an increase in contract price in excess of the administrative authority of the city administrator or mayor as provided in subsection A of this section where unforeseen conditions necessitate an immediate change to avoid a contractor’s claim against the city for delays. The work change directive shall be incorporated into a change order and presented to the city council as soon thereafter as practicable.

c. Authorize and direct emergency work that may result in an increase in contract price in excess of the administrative authority of the city administrator or mayor as provided in subsection A of this section where public health, safety and welfare are endangered. The work change directive shall be incorporated into a change order and presented to the city council as soon thereafter as practicable.

d. The city council will be notified of work change directives issued in excess of the administrative authority of the city administrator or mayor as soon as practicable.

G. “Contract” means any agreement creating a legal relationship between the city and another person or entity, or any amendment thereto. (Ord. 1887 § 4, 2016; Ord. 1881 § 4, 2015; Ord. 1722 § 1, 2008).

5.36.010 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the words and terms used shall have the same meaning each has under Chapter 218, Laws of 1973, 1st Extraordinary Session and Chapter 9.46 RCW, each as amended, and under the rules of the Washington State Gambling Commission, WAC Title 230, unless otherwise specifically provided or as the context in which they are used clearly indicates that they be given some other meaning. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.020 Tax levied.

There is levied upon all persons, associations and organizations conducting or operating within the city any of the activities listed in this section, a tax in the following amounts to be paid to Milton:

A. Bingo and raffles in the amount of five percent of the gross revenue received therefrom less the amount paid for or as prizes;

C. Card playing in the amount of 20 percent of the gross receipts received as fees charged persons for the privilege of playing in card games;

D. Amusement games only to the extent of an amount sufficient to pay the actual costs of enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, and in no event shall such taxation exceed two percent of the gross revenue therefrom, less the amount paid for or as prizes. (Ord. 1533 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.030 Exemptions from tax.

No tax shall be imposed under the authority of this chapter on bingo, raffles or amusement games when such activities, or any combination thereof, are conducted by any bona fide charitable or nonprofit organization as defined in RCW 9.46.020(3), and which organization has not paid operating or management personnel and has gross income from such activities not exceeding $5,000 per year less the amount paid for as prizes. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.040 Procedure for payment.

The taxes imposed under this chapter shall be due and payable in monthly installments and remittance therefor shall be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax accrued. The taxpayer shall, on or before the fifteenth day of said month, make out a return on such forms and setting forth such information as the administration and finance director may require showing the amount of the tax for which he is liable for the preceding monthly period, sign and transmit the same to the city clerk together with a remittance for such amount, provided:

A. Whenever a person, association or organization taxable under this chapter conducting or operating a taxable activity on a regular basis terminates the business, sells out or otherwise disposes of this business, any tax due under this chapter shall become due and payable and such taxpayer shall within 10 days thereafter make a return and pay the tax due.

B. Whenever it appears to the administration and finance director that the collection of taxes from any person, association or organization may be in jeopardy, the administration and finance director after not less than 10 days notice to the taxpayer, is authorized to require that the taxpayer remit taxes and returns at such shorter intervals than monthly as the city clerk shall deem appropriate under the circumstances. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.050 Administration and collection.

Administration and collection of the various taxes imposed by this chapter shall be the responsibility of the administration and finance director. The taxpayer shall be required to swear and affirm by signature that the information given on the return is true, accurate and complete under penalty of perjury. The administration and finance director shall make forms available to the public in reasonable numbers in the administration and finance director’s office during regular business hours. Along with the tax remittance and return form for each month ending a calendar quarter year, each taxpayer shall submit to the administration and finance director a copy of his quarterly report to the Washington State Gambling Commission required by Chapter 230-08 WAC as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.060 Terms of acceptance of payment.

Taxes payable under this chapter shall be remitted to the administration and finance director on or before the time required by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order or in cash. If payment is made by a draft or check the tax shall not be deemed paid until the draft or check is accepted in the usual course of business. Nor shall the acceptance of any sum by the administration and finance director be an acquittance or discharge of the tax unless the amount paid is the full amount due. The return and copy of the quarterly report to the Washington State Gambling Commission shall be filed with the administration and finance director after notation of that office upon the return of the amount actually received. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.070 Penalties and interest charges for late payment.

A. If full payment of any tax or fee due under this chapter is not received by the administration and finance director on or before the due date, there shall be added to the amount due a penalty fee as follows:

1. One through 10 days late: 10 percent of tax due;

2. Eleven through 20 days late: 15 percent of tax due;

3. Twenty-one through 30 days late: 20 percent of tax due;

4. Thirty-one through 60 days late: 25 percent of tax due.

B. In addition to the penalty set out in subsection A of this section, the administration and finance director shall charge the taxpayer interest for all taxes and fees due at the rate of one percent per month or portion thereof that the amounts are past due. Failure to make payment in full of all tax amounts and penalties within 60 days following the day the tax amount initially became due shall be both a civil and a criminal violation of this section. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.080 Filing required before operation of taxable activity.

In order that the city may identify those persons who are subject to taxation under this chapter, each person, association or organization shall file with the administration and finance director a sworn declaration of intent to conduct an activity taxable under this chapter upon a form to be prescribed by the administration and finance director together with a copy of the license issued therefor by the Washington State Gambling Commission. The filing shall be made not later than 15 days prior to conducting or operating the taxable activity. No fee shall be charged for such filing which is not for the purpose of regulation of this activity but for the purposes of administration of this taxing chapter only. Failure to timely file shall not excuse any person, association or organization from tax liability. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.090 Filing – New declaration necessary after license expiration, suspension or revocation.

A new declaration of intent to conduct or operate any of the activities taxable under this chapter shall be required prior to the recommencement of the activity following the expiration, suspension or revocation of any license previously issued by the Washington State Gambling Commission in the same manner as described in MMC 5.36.080. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.100 Records of activity required.

Each person, association or organization engaging in an activity taxable under this chapter shall maintain records respecting that activity which truly, completely and accurately disclose all information necessary to determine the taxpayer’s tax liability under this chapter during each base tax period. Such records shall be kept and maintained for a period of not less than three years. In addition, all information and items required by the Washington State Gambling Commission under Chapter 230-08 WAC and the United States Internal Revenue Service respecting taxation shall be kept and maintained for the period required by those agencies. All books, records and other items required to be kept and maintained under this section shall be subject to and immediately made available for inspection and audit during normal business hours with or without notice at the place where such records are kept on demand by the administration and finance director for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this taxing chapter. Failure of a taxpayer to keep books and records as required by this section shall be a bar to contesting the assessment of taxes as estimated by the city clerk. Where a taxpayer does not keep all of the books, records, or items required to be kept or maintained under this section in this jurisdiction so that the above state officials or their designees may examine them conveniently, the taxpayer shall either:

A. Produce all of the required books, records or items within this jurisdiction for such inspection within five days following a request of the above officials that he do so; or

B. Bear the actual cost of inspection by the above officials or their designees at the location where such books, records or items are located; provided, that a taxpayer choosing to bear these costs shall pay in advance to the above-stated officials or their designees the estimated costs thereof, including, but not limited to, round trip fare by the most rapid means, lodging, meals and incidental expenses; the actual amount due or to be refunded for expenses shall be determined following said examination of the records. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.110 Overpayment and underpayment – Refunds and penalties.

If upon application by a taxpayer for a refund or for an audit of his records or upon any examination of the returns or records of any taxpayer it is determined by the administration and finance director that within three years immediately preceding receipt by the administration and finance director of the application by the taxpayer for a refund or an audit in the absence of such an application within the three years immediately preceding the commencement by the city clerk of such examination:

A. A tax or other fee has been paid in excess of that properly due, the total excess paid over all amounts due to the city within such period of three years shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer at the taxpayer’s option. No refund or credit shall be allowed with respect to the city clerk for more than three years before the date of such application for examination.

B. A tax or other fee has been paid which is less than that properly due or no tax or other fee has been paid, the administration and finance director shall mail a statement by certified mail to the taxpayer showing the balance due including the tax amount of the penalty, assessments and fees, and it shall be a separate additional violation of this chapter if a taxpayer fails to make a payment in full within 10 calendar days of such mailing. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.120 Failure of taxpayer to file return – Administration and finance director authorized to set tax due.

If any taxpayer fails, neglects or refuses to make and file his return as and when required under this chapter, the administration and finance director is authorized to determine the amount of tax payable together with any penalty and/or interest assessed under the provisions of this chapter and by certified mail to notify such taxpayer of the amount so determined, which amount shall thereupon become the tax penalty and/or interest and shall become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.130 Tax separate from license fee.

The tax levied in this chapter shall be additional to any license fee or tax imposed or levied under any law or any other resolution of the city except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.140 Rules and regulations – Council to adopt, publish and enforce.

The council shall have the power and it shall be their duty from time to time to adopt, publish and enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter or with superior law for the purposes of carrying out the provisions hereof and it shall be unlawful to violate or fail to comply with any such rule or regulation. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.150 Tax due constitutes debt.

Any tax due and unpaid under this chapter and all penalties or fees shall constitute a debt to the city, a legal subdivision of the state of Washington, and may be collected by court proceedings the same as any other debt in like amount which shall be in addition to all other existent remedies. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.160 Three-year limit on recovery.

The right of recovery by the city from the taxpayer for any tax provided under this chapter shall be outlawed after the expiration of three calendar years from the date said tax became due. The right of recovery against the city because of overpayment of tax by any taxpayer shall be outlawed after the expiration of three calendar years from the date such payment was made. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.36.170 Violations – Penalty.

Any person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or any lawful rule or regulation adopted by the administration and finance director pursuant thereto shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

E. “Employee” means any and all persons, including managers, entertainers, and independent contractors who work in or at or render any services directly related to the operation of any adult entertainment establishment.

5.44.020 Findings of fact.

Based on public testimony and other evidence presented to it, the city council on February, 1996, makes the following findings of fact by adoption of Ordinance 1292:

A. The secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this chapter are detrimental to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and, therefore, such activities must be regulated. Studies and reports from other jurisdictions relied upon include the August 9, 1995, report by Federal Way city attorney Londi K. Lindell to the Federal Way mayor and councilmembers and the summary of land use studies from 13 other jurisdictions, copies of which are attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Exhibits “A” and “B.”

B. Regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred. This history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution, illegal employment of minors, narcotics and alcoholic beverage law violations, breaches of the peace, tax evasion and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants.

C. Proximity or contact between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances or between patrons in panorams and adult motion picture theaters can facilitate sexual contact, prostitution and related crimes. Concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.

D. The activities described in subsections B and C of this section occur, in the absence of regulation, regardless of whether the adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages.

E. It is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors, to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible.

F. It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees.

G. The license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry.

H. Hidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation. These hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white-collar crime elements. In order for the city to effectively protect the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of its citizens and effectively allocate its law enforcement resources, it is important that the city be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments, and identities and backgrounds of persons responsible for management and control of the adult entertainment establishment.

I. It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, but rather to enact time, place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the city in mitigating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.

J. In an undercover operation in 1995, police officers entered the Deja Vu live adult entertainment establishment in neighboring Federal Way, Washington over an approximately five-month period. Approximately 24 criminal violations were charged for acts occurring while the officers were inside Deja Vu. Police officers repeatedly observed managers ignoring criminal law violations committed inside Deja Vu, within a short distance from the manager. Managers would look at the patrons/officers while criminal violations were committed by the entertainers. Entertainers continuously violated the Federal Way City Code. (Ord. 1447 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.44.030 Penalties.

A. Criminal Penalty. Any person violating any of the terms of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof be punished as provided in Chapter 1.08 MMC.

B. Civil Penalty. In addition to any other penalty provided in this section or by law, any person who violates any provision of any business license ordinance shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $250.00 per violation, to be directly assessed by the city clerk. The city clerk, in a reasonable manner, may vary the amount of the penalty assessed to consider the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the violator; the gravity of the violation; the number of past and present violations committed; and the good faith of the violator in attempting to achieve compliance after notification of the violation. All civil penalties assessed will be enforced and collected in accordance with the procedure specified under this chapter. (Ord. 1447 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.44.040 Additional enforcement.

Notwithstanding the existence or use of any other remedy, the city clerk may seek legal or equitable relief to enjoin any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter. (Ord. 1447 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.44.050 Business hours.

No adult entertainment shall be conducted between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. (Ord. 1447 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1434 § 1, 1999).


5.44.060 Activities not prohibited.

2. Hold it in a place on the business premises of the dealer to which police officers shall have access at any time during the dealer’s regular business hours; and

3. Keep the item safe from alteration, loss, damage, or commingling with other goods.

B. In cases where the police have placed verbal hold on an item, the police must then give written notice within 10 business days. If such written notice is not received within that period of time, then the hold order will cease.

C. In any event, the hold will expire at the end of 120 days, unless renewed in writing by a law enforcement officer. The renewal period shall be of the same duration. Property held shall not be released for 120 days from the date of police notification unless released by written consent of the police chief or his or her designee or by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

D. After receipt of notification from a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer, if an additional holding period is required, the police shall give the pawnbroker or secondhand dealer written notice, prior to the expiration of the existing hold order. The police shall not place on hold any item of personal property unless that agency reasonably suspects that the item of personal property is a lost or stolen item.

3. In the event that any gross misdemeanor adopted pursuant to municipal ordinance establishes a penalty different from a penalty prescribed for that crime by state statute, the penalty prescribed by state statute shall control.

C. Punishment for Misdemeanors.

1. Every person convicted of a misdemeanor defined in MMC Title 9 shall be punished by imprisonment in a municipal jail or a county jail for a maximum term fixed by the court of not more than 90 days, or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of not more than $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine.

E. Alternative to a Fine – Restitution. RCW 9A.20.030 as now or hereafter amended is adopted by reference as part of the ordinance codified in this chapter:

1. If a person has gained money or property or caused a victim to lose money or property through the commission of a crime, upon conviction thereof or when the offender pleads guilty to a lesser offense or fewer offenses and agrees with the prosecutor’s recommendation that the offender be required to pay restitution to a victim of an offense or offenses which are not prosecuted pursuant to a plea agreement, the court, in lieu of imposing the fine authorized for the offense under the ordinance may order the defendant to pay an amount, fixed by the court, not to exceed double the amount of the defendant’s gain or victim’s loss from the commission of a crime. Such amount may be used to provide restitution to the victim at the order of the court. It shall be the duty of the prosecuting attorney to investigate the alternative of restitution, and to recommend it to the court, when the prosecuting attorney believes that restitution is appropriate and feasible. If the court orders restitution, the court shall make a finding as to the amount of the defendant’s gain or victim’s loss from the crime, and if the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support such finding the court may conduct a hearing upon the issue. For purposes of this section, the terms “gain” or “loss” refer to the amount of money or the value of property or services gained or lost.

2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section also applies to any corporation or joint stock association found guilty of any crime. (Ord. 1370 § 1, 1998; Ord. 1239 § 1, 1994; Ord. 1086 § 1, 1988).

9.13.010 Findings.

The city finds as follows:

A. The city had established a moratorium on the issuance of additional licenses by the State Gambling Commission of social card games conducted as a commercial stimulant for the purposes of studying its effects, and to receive public input; and

B. The city has reviewed the effects of casinos and gambling in other communities in the nation and received public input at its public hearings; and

C. During the public hearings both the general public and operators of social card games conducted as a commercial stimulant provided input to the city council; and

D. RCW 9.46.295 authorizes municipalities to prohibit certain gambling activities otherwise authorized; and

E. After receiving public input and being advised of the action taken by neighboring municipalities, the city deemed it to be in the public interest and welfare to prohibit certain social card games as defined in RCW 9.46.0282; and

F. The State Legislature in amendments to the State Gambling Act allowed certain enhanced card rooms which are commonly referred to as mini-casinos; and

G. As a result of this authorization, there has been established a number of mini-casinos in the south King County and Pierce County regions; and

H. There are adverse effects as the result of the establishment of the mini-casinos which include, but are not limited to, perceptions by residences and business of the negative effect that such mini-casinos would have and therefore do not desire to have a residence or a business in the same municipality where such exist; and

I. Under the Growth Management Act, GMA, the city is required to infill and provide high density development within its boundaries and the establishment of mini-casinos could be adverse to attracting occupants for such developments; and

J. The establishment of mini-casinos is not in harmony with the comprehensive plan as it has a negative effect on the attraction of business and residential development into the urban area; and

9.44.010 Purpose.

Since there are a growing number of alarm systems being sold and installed in the city of Milton, Washington, and its environs, causing the Milton police department to respond to alarm signals from such systems, and since there are a growing number of signals which are not the result of a life safety issue, burglary or robbery, and recognizing the value of effective alarm systems in responding to fire and medical emergencies, and in deterring crime and apprehending criminals, it is the purpose of this chapter to regulate the installation of alarm systems, to improve system effectiveness and to reduce, insofar as possible, the number of false alarms, causing police and fire department response. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.020 Definitions.

As used in this chapter:

A. “Alarm condition” means an actual fire or medical emergency, or actual or attempted burglary or robbery.

B. “Alarm system” means any mechanism, equipment, or device which is designed to detect a fire or signal a medical emergency, or detect an unauthorized entry into any building or onto any property, or to direct attention to robbery in progress, and to signal the above occurrences either by a local or audible alarm or by a silent or remote alarm. Alarm systems shall not include alarms installed in motor vehicles, which by their nature are mobile and are intended to prevent theft through the creation of a loud noise. Alarm devices, which automatically dial telephone numbers and/or play prerecorded messages, are prohibited.

C. “Employee” is a person who is employed by an alarm business and who sells, installs, services, maintains, repairs or replaces alarm systems in the city of Milton, or its environs.

D. “False alarm” means an alarm signal transmitted in the absence of an alarm condition, which results in police department response to the location of the alarm.

E. “Local or audible alarm” means an alarm that when activated makes a loud noise at or near the protected area or floods the site with lights, or both.

F. “Person” includes any individual, partnership, corporation or association.

G. “Silent or remote alarm” means an alarm without an obvious local indication that an alarm has been activated, which transmits a signal to a remote monitoring station.

H. “User” means any person who installs, operates, maintains, or engages another person to install, operate, or maintain an alarm system at a particular location which he/she owns or leases. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.040 Instruction as to the operation of the system – User responsible for maintenance – Service contracts.

A. The user shall be knowledgeable of proper operation of the system after it is installed. It shall be the responsibility of the user to see that all employees and persons regularly using the premises on which the alarm is installed are instructed in proper operating procedures to avoid false alarm signals.

B. It shall be the responsibility of the user of an alarm system to cause the system to be maintained in reliable operating condition. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.050 Persons responding to activated alarms.

The user shall not maintain or have any alarm system unless there is on file with the Milton police department the names and telephone numbers of at least two persons who are authorized to enter such premises and turn off the alarm. Upon notification of an activated alarm, at least one such person designated by the user shall proceed immediately to the location of the activated alarm and render all necessary service and assistance to restore the alarm to normal condition or to reset the alarm. Responding personnel shall arrive on the scene within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the alarm. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.060 Notifying police of alarms – Records.

A. When anyone, including an alarm business, notifies the Milton police department, or any employee thereof, of an activated alarm, he or she shall state its business name and furnish the address of the activated alarm, the name and type of establishment from which the alarm is originated, the precise location of the alarm (if there is more than one floor or department), and the type of alarm such as silent robbery, silent burglary, or ringer-type alarm.

B. The Milton police department shall maintain a record of all police calls made in response to an activated alarm including the time, date and location of the alarm.

C. The Milton fire department shall maintain a record of all fire calls made in response to an activated alarm including the time, date and location of the alarm. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1394 § 1, 1998; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.070 Local or audible alarm system cutoff.

Every alarm system which uses a local or audible alarm device to attract the attention of the public shall be equipped with an automatic 10-minute cutoff device or shall be silenced manually by the user or his representative. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.080 Operational defects to be remedied.

The sensory mechanisms used in connection with alarm systems shall be adjusted to suppress false alarms so that the device will not be activated by impulses due to transient pressure changes in water pipes, short flashes of light, wind noises such as the rattling or vibrating of doors or windows, vehicular noises adjacent to the installation, or other forces unrelated to genuine alarms. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.100 Alarm user permits required. 

A. Every alarm user shall obtain an alarm user’s permit for each system from the city clerk within 30 days of the time when the system becomes operative. A $20.00 fee shall be charged for alarm user permits.

C. An alarm permit holder will prominently display the alarm permit sticker at or near the front door of the alarmed establishment or residence.

D. Failure to obtain a valid alarm permit within the 30-day requirement will result in a penalty of $100.00 in addition to any false alarm fee assessed under MMC 9.44.120(D) for each false alarm/activation without a valid permit. (Ord. 1608 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1394 § 2, 1998; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).


9.44.110 Improper activation of alarm.

It is unlawful for anyone to activate any fire, medical emergency, robbery or burglary alarm for the purpose of summoning fire or police except in the event of an actual fire or medical emergency, or actual or attempted burglary or robbery, or for anyone notifying the police of an activated alarm and having knowledge that such activation was apparently caused by an electrical or other malfunction of the alarm system to fail at the same time to notify the police of such apparent malfunction. (Ord. 1460 § 1, 2000; Ord. 1108 § 1, 1989).

(Ord. 1480 § 1, 2001; Ord. 549 § 1, 1968).

Such permit shall be granted only upon compliance with the following terms and conditions:

A. The party requesting such permit shall make application in writing and simultaneously therewith file with the city a plat showing the location and plan of the excavation, cutting or other work desired to be done, and the street, alley or place to be so used, together with a full description of the nature of the work. The director of public works shall thereupon examine such application and plat, and if the same shall be approved and proper performance bond filed, as hereinafter provided, permits may be issued.

B. Such permit shall specify the place where such acts are to be performed and done, together with a description of the proposed work to be done under such permit and the length of time allowed for the completion thereof. The permittee shall further be required to replace to its former condition whatever portion of the street, alley, pavement or improvement that may have been disturbed or affected in any way during such work, and such permit may further specify whether the city elects to do the work of restoring the surface as provided in this chapter.

C. The acts and work permitted under such permit, and the restoration to its former condition of such street, alley, pavement or improvement, shall at all times be performed under the supervision and control of the director of public works or an appointed designee, but at the sole cost and expense of the permittee.

D. In making any excavation, cut or break in any public street, avenue, or alley, the materials thus excavated from the trenches thereof not otherwise suitable for backfilling shall be disposed of as directed by the city. All such excavations shall be backfilled with approved materials and shall be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent.

E. The maximum length of any open trench during such work shall at no time exceed 200 lineal feet, except when otherwise granted by special written permission from the director of public works. No open ditches shall be left overnight or on weekends.

F. All existing storm sewer facilities and other utilities that are moved or disconnected during such work shall be replaced immediately as directed, and all excavated areas shall be cleaned thoroughly and swept immediately after backfilling and after completion of compaction. All cuts shall be continuous, and shall be made with saws specifically equipped for this purpose. No skip cutting will be allowed. Any pavement which is damaged outside the allowable trench widths shall be repaired entirely at the contractor’s expense.

G. If the director of public works so elects, all excavated materials at intersections shall be removed and disposed of and steel driving plates placed over trenches so as to provide safe and adequate passage for vehicular and pedestrian traffic at all times.

H. In excavating any public street, avenue or alley, the surface material and earth removed must be kept separate and deposited in a manner that will occasion the least inconvenience to or interference with the public, with adequate provision for proper surface drainage and safe passage for the traveling public. Such surface or pavement, after refilling, shall be placed in as good condition and wear as it existed immediately prior to the excavations. If the permittee shall fail to complete such work and restore such street, alley, pavement or improvement before the expiration of the time fixed by such permit, the director of public works shall, if he deems it advisable, cause such work to be done by the city or any other party in order to return such street alley, pavement, improvement, or place to its original and proper condition as it existed immediately prior to such excavation; in such case the permittee shall be liable unto the city for any and all work performed, and the city shall have the right to proceed against the performance bond filed by said permittee as provided in this chapter. The city shall have a right of action against such permittee for all fees, expenses and costs paid out and incurred in connection with such work, not otherwise covered by said bond.

I. The permittee, as a further condition to the issuance of such permit, shall warrant and guarantee unto the city the work performed and the restoration of the premises for a period of two years from the date of completion of such work.

J. If a permit is issued for excavation for the purpose of installing, maintaining, repairing, or replacing any gas service line to carry gas from a main or gas line, within a street, alley or public place to private property for use of such gas thereon, the permittee shall further agree, in the application for any such permit, that if the structure or facility on any such private property to which gas is introduced or furnished by the service line shall thereafter cease to be occupied for one year or more, or shall no longer be used or useful, the permittee and each of its successors and assigns will, upon any such occurrence, cut and cap such service line to prevent further flow of gas to such structure or facilities, or, upon written demand of the city take such similar action. Upon completion of such work including the capping of such line, the same shall be reported to the city in writing. Permittee agrees, whenever possible, to notify the city in writing whenever any such structure or facility has ceased to be serviced by any gas line or has otherwise discontinued or abandoned the use thereof.

K. The city shall have the right to elect, and to specify such election on the permit to be issued, that the refilling of all trenches made in a public street, alley or highway, and the repaving or resurfacing thereof, may be done by the city and any and all costs and expenses in connection therewith be charged to and paid by the permittee and/or the sureties of his/her performance bond. Such bond shall be in an amount not less than the anticipated cost of the work to be done.

L. The city will not be responsible for locating and/or exposing city-owned or private utilities, storm drains, sewers, or any underground facility; the city will, however, attempt to the best of its ability to reference, in general, underground facilities. It shall be the sole responsibility of the permittee to use whatever proper precautions are necessary in all excavation with respect to all underground facilities to ensure the prevention of any damage whatsoever, to include the use of hand labor if necessary.

A. A net metering system used by a customer-generator shall include, at the customer-generator’s own expense, all equipment necessary to meet applicable safety, power quality, and interconnection requirements established by the National Electrical Code, National Electrical Safety Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Underwriters Laboratories.

B. The city, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment, may adopt by regulation additional safety, power quality, and interconnection requirements for customer-generators, including limitations on the number of customer-generators and total capacity of net metering systems that may be interconnected to any distribution feeder line, circuit, or network that the commission or governing body determines are necessary to protect public safety and system reliability.

C. The city will not require a customer-generator whose net metering system meets the standards in subsections A and B of this section to comply with additional safety or performance standards, perform or pay for additional tests, or purchase additional liability insurance. However, an electric utility shall not be liable directly or indirectly for permitting or continuing to allow an attachment of a net metering system, or for the acts or omissions of the customer-generator that cause loss or injury, including death, to any third party. (Ord. 1919 § 2, 2017).

c. Food Processors Commodity Charges. Charges for any customer in Code Classification 10 shall be determined using the monitored result basis set forth in the Official Code of the City of Tacoma at Sections 12.08.390 and 12.08.400, which sections are adopted by reference as though set forth herein in full, under the following formula as applied to Milton customers:

1991: $.85 x the rate established by the City of Tacoma + $.70 

1992 and 1993: $.85 x the rate established by the City of Tacoma + $.60

3. Calculation and Review of Commodity Charges. The monthly commodity charge for all customer classes other than industrial and commercial shall be based on the winter average water use. The winter average water use shall be determined on the water consumption of January, February, November and December.

a. The winter average shall be recalculated each year for each customer to which the winter average applies and the amount determined shall be used in the rate calculation for the succeeding 12-month period.

b. In the event a residential customer has had continuous service from the city water system for a 12-month period including the months used in the winter average calculation, the winter average established by said customer shall continue to be used until recalculated, as provided in subsection c of this section, even though the customer relocates to a new service address.

c. In the event that a customer does not have a unique and separate winter average, or is not in residence for a full winter average period, the director of public works shall:

i. Assign the winter average as determined by the whole class of customers connected to the system; or

ii. Use the months within the winter average period for which a record exists for the customer in determining the winter average.

d. Where a customer is connected to a water system not operated by the city of Milton, the customer shall provide copies of billings, showing water consumption, to the city of Milton at such intervals to allow proper and timely billing by the city of Milton for sewer rates. Such customer shall also pay the monthly service charge.

e. Where a customer is not connected to a public water system, the director of public works shall determine and establish the commodity charge taking into account like users. Such customer shall also pay the monthly service charge.

f. If a group of units is served by one water meter, the commodity charge per each 100 cubic feet of water used for each unit shall be determined by dividing the total water usage by the number of units served by that meter.

g. The commodity charge shall be determined as follows:

i. Industrial and commercial customer classes the metered monthly water use per 100 cubic feet shall be rounded up to the nearest 100 and multiplied by the commodity charges indicated therein.

ii. All other customer classes: the calculated monthly average water use based on the winter average shall be rounded up to the nearest 100 and multiplied by the commodity charges indicated herein.

B. All residential and commercial customers outside the city limits shall have a 50 percent surcharge on the service charge and on the commodity charge.

C. Where two or more classifications apply the higher rate shall be charged. Where one connection is made to serve more than one commercial unit the service charge and the commodity charge, shall be based on the total of the units served. Special or unusual situations may have rates established by contract or by determination by the council upon written request for such determination.

D. Any commercial business such as a service station so facilitated to receive discharge of sewage from other than commercial transporters or sewage disposal businesses may upon the approval of the public works department and upon the payment of a $100.00 fee receive an annual permit for such service to travel trailers, campers and similar recreational vehicles.

E. There shall be no commercial or private dumping of septic tanks into the Milton sewer service.

F. The effective dates of service charges and commodity charges shall take effect as set forth below:

1. Domestic and residential business service and commodity charges shall change on February 16, 1992 as set forth at Section 13.20.070A1 and shall continue in effect until otherwise amended. 

2. Commercial and industrial service charges shall change December 16, 1991 and again December 16, 1992 as set forth at Section 13.20.070A2(a) and shall continue in effect until otherwise amended.

3. Commercial and industrial commodity charges shall change December 16, 1991 and again on December 16, 1992 as set forth at Section 13.20.070A2(b) and shall continue in effect until otherwise amended.

13.26.010 Findings.

A. The city council finds that all real property in the city contributes runoff to the common drainage problem, and that all real property in the city benefits from the storm and surface water utility system in the city.

B. The city council finds that the intensity of development on all parcels of real property, as measured by the square footage of impervious surface area, is an appropriate basis for determination of an individual parcel’s contribution to the problem of storm and surface water runoff.

C. The city council also finds that each owner of a parcel of real property within the city should pay for his or her share of the cost of constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing, improving and replacing drainage facilities in proportion to the amount of runoff contributed to the drainage system.

D. The city council finds that the storm water utility protects all city properties, whether or not those properties contribute to storm water runoff. The storm water utility provides a benefit to all city property owners by protecting groundwater and protecting residents from flooding, landslides, erosion, and water quality degradation. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.020 Potential hazard declared.

The city council finds and declares that, absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation and control, existing storm water drainage conditions in all drainage basins within the city constitute a potential hazard to the health, safety and general welfare of the city. The city council further finds that natural and manmade storm water facilities and conveyances together constitute a storm water drainage system, and that effective regulation and control of storm water through formation, by the city, of a storm and surface water utility require the transfer to the utility of all storm water facilities and conveyances and related rights belonging to the city. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.030 Purpose.

The provisions of this chapter are intended to guide and advise all who conduct new development or redevelopment within the city. The provisions of this chapter establish the minimum level of compliance which must be met to permit a property to be developed or redeveloped.

It is the purpose of this section to:

A. Minimize water quality degradation and control of sedimentation in streams, ponds, lakes, wetlands, and other water bodies;

B. Minimize the impact of increased runoff, erosion, and sedimentation caused by land development and maintenance practices;

C. Maintain and protect groundwater resources;

D. Minimize adverse impacts of alterations on ground and surface water quantities, locations, and flow patterns;

E. Decrease potential landslide, flood, and erosion damage to public and private property;

F. Promote site planning and construction practices that are consistent with natural, topographical, vegetational, and hydrological conditions;

G. Maintain and protect the city storm water management infrastructure and those downstream;

H. Provide a means of regulating clearing and grading of private and public land while minimizing water quality impacts in order to protect public health and safety;

I. Provide minimum development and redevelopment regulations and construction procedures which will preserve, replace, or enhance, to the maximum extent practical, existing vegetation to preserve and enhance the natural qualities of lands, wetlands, and water bodies;

J. Preserve and enhance the suitability of water for contact recreation and fish habitat; and

K. Protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.040 Storm and surface water management utility created – Responsibilities.

There is created and established pursuant to Chapters 35A.80 and 35.67 RCW, and Article II, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, a storm and surface water utility. All references to “the utility” in this chapter refer to the storm and surface water utility. The utility will have authority and responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance, administration and operation of all city storm water conveyances and facilities. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.050 Property transferred to utility.

Title and all other incidents of ownership of the following assets are hereby transferred to and vested in the utility: all properties, interests and physical and intangible rights of every nature owned or held by the city, however acquired, insofar as they relate to or concern storm water; further including, without limitation, all properties, interests and rights acquired by adverse possession or by prescription, directly or through another, in and to the drainage or storage, or both, of storm waters, through, under or over lands, watercourses, sloughs, streams, ponds, lakes and swamps, all beginning in each instance at a point where storm waters first enter the system of the city and ending in each instance at a point where the storm waters exit from the system of the city, and in width to the full extent of inundation caused by storm or flood conditions. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.060 Utility plan.

There is hereby specified and adopted as the system and plan of the utility, including a declaration of the estimated costs thereof, the city storm water management plan dated March, 1996. Where there is any conflict or discrepancy between the provisions of the plan and any provision of this chapter, the latter shall control. Said plan may be updated and amended subject to council approval. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.070 Utility administered by director.

The utility shall be administered by the director. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.080 System of charges.

There is imposed a system of rates and charges on each parcel of real property within the city served by or to which is available for service the utility established by this chapter. The charges are found to be reasonable and necessary to fund the current administration, planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and repair of existing storm and surface water facilities; provided, however, that the city reserves the right to fix, alter, regulate and control the rates and charges. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.090 Charges.

The following utility charges are established for all parcels of real property within the city:

A. Developed Commercial and Industrial Parcels. The storm drainage utility monthly service charge shall be computed by dividing the total amount of measured impervious surface on the property, in square feet, by 2,800 and then multiplying the quotient by the monthly unit rate of $15.50.

B. Developed Single-Family and Two-Family Residential (Duplex). All single-family and two-family residences (“residence” is defined in MMC 17.08.720) shall be billed according to a tiered system. This system shall have three tiers that are based upon percentage of a parcel that is covered with impervious surfaces as follows:

	Tier	% Covered	Monthly Rate

	1	0 – 40%	$15.50

	2	41 – 70%	$25.50

	3	71% +	$35.50

C. Developed Multifamily Residential. All residential multifamily parcels shall be charged by impervious surface calculation according to subsection A of this section.

D. Undeveloped Parcels. Undeveloped parcels (lots with less than 750 square feet of impervious surface) shall be charged $5.10 per month and shall be invoiced annually.

E. State Highway Rights-of-Way. State of Washington highway rights-of-way shall be charged consistent with this chapter and Chapter 90.03 RCW including RCW 90.03.525.

F. Service Charge Credit.

1. Credit shall apply to all categories of land use with the exception of vacant/undeveloped, forest and timber land and city streets, roads, and public highways.

2. Low income senior citizens and low income disabled persons receiving relief under RCW 84.36.381 shall receive the following partial exemption from storm water utility charges and surcharge, as applicable:

a. All parcels for which a person qualifies for an exemption under RCW 84.36.381(5)(a) shall be exempt from 40 percent of storm water utility charges.

b. All parcels for which a person qualifies for an exemption under RCW 84.36.381(5)(b)(i) shall be exempt from 60 percent of storm water utility charges.

c. All parcels for which a person qualifies for an exemption under RCW 84.36.381(5)(b)(ii) shall be exempt from 80 percent of storm water utility charges.

G. Detention System Credits. The detention system credits defined below shall be applicable only to detention systems approved prior to February 1, 2006. No detention system credits shall be allowed for any retention or detention systems approved after January 31, 2006.

Credits shall be given to applicants upon approval by the public works director subject to rates pursuant to this chapter as follows:

1. Seventy-Five Percent Credit. Property served by a privately maintained detention system with a 100-year storage/two-year predevelopment release rate shall be given a credit in the amount of 75 percent of the full utility rate. This credit shall also apply to any eligible city-owned and maintained system.

2. Twenty-Five Percent Credit. Property owned by other than the city served by a city-maintained detention system with a 100-year storage/two-year predeveloped release rate shall be given a credit in the amount of 25 percent of the full utility rate.

3. Existing detention system credits shall only be applicable to $8.50 per ESU of the storm drain utility monthly charge. Such credits shall not apply to any monthly charge in excess of $8.50 per ESU.

4. If the city determines at any time that the detention system does not meet the requirements of subsection (G)(1) or (2) of this section, or is not operating at the level of storage/release for which credit is being applied or for which credit has been granted, the director shall have the authority to reduce the credit to the next applicable level, if any, or to eliminate the credit entirely if the system is determined to not comply with the requirements of subsection (G)(1) or (2) of this section.

5. Appeals. A request for reconsideration of the director’s decision to reduce or eliminate any existing credit may be made by providing design calculations and maintenance records that confirm the detention system does meet the design and maintenance requirements for which credit is being applied or for which credit has been granted. The decision of the director shall be final and conclusive, unless within 10 days of the date of the director’s action, the applicant gives written notice of appeal to the hearing examiner for review of the action.

H. Rates shall become effective for the October 2016 billing cycle. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1902 § 1, 2016; Ord. 1867 § 1, 2015; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).


13.26.100 Billing and collection.

Utility rates and charges for each parcel of real property within the city shall be computed on a monthly basis. The city shall bill the owner of the served property for the payment of utility rates and charges specified in this chapter; however, the owner may have the bills mailed to a tenant, or agent, but this shall not relieve the owner from liability for utility rates and charges.

2. Delivery. The correction notice, stop work order, notice of violation, or stop work order shall be personally served on the responsible person(s), posted conspicuously on the premises, or mailed to responsible person(s) with delivery confirmation.

G. Penalties. The director or hearing examiner, after considering all available information, shall assess a penalty for each violation described in subsection A of this section but the amount of the penalty may be modified based on the mitigating factors set forth below:

1. Schedule of Civil Penalties. The director or hearing examiner shall determine penalties as follows:

a. Maximum Penalty. A violation described in subsection A of this section is subject to a civil penalty of up to $500.00 per day. Each day or portion thereof during which the violation exists is a separate civil violation and may be considered a repeat violation as described in subsection (G)(2) of this section.

b. Commencement Date. The penalty shall commence on the date of the violation, unless otherwise provided for in a notice of violation.

c. Mitigating Factors. The penalty shall be assessed by the director or hearing examiner based on the severity of the violation, taking into account the following mitigating factors described below:

i. Was the responsible party willful or knowing of the violation?

ii. Was the responsible party unresponsive in correcting the violation?

iii. Was there improper operation or maintenance?

iv. Does the violation provide economic benefit for noncompliance?

v. Does the discharge result in adverse economic impact to others?

vi. Will cleanup activities be able to fully mitigate or remediate the impacts?

vii. Is there a history of violations?

viii. Were there unforeseeable circumstances that precluded compliance? and

ix. Did the responsible party make a good-faith effort to comply?

2. Repeat Violations. For repeat violations that occur within two years of a previous violation, the director or hearing examiner may impose the following penalties, taking into account the mitigating factors described in subsection (G)(1) of this section:

a. For the first repeat violation, the penalty may equal up to $1,000 per day;

d. For the fourth repeat violation, the penalty may equal up to $4,000 per day; and

e. For each additional violation that may occur beyond the fourth repeat violation, the penalty may equal up to $5,000 per day. 

3. Allocation of Penalties. In the event a notice of violation is issued against more than one responsible person(s), recoverable penalties, costs, and expenses may be allocated among the responsible person(s) based upon the extent to which each responsible person’s acts or omissions caused the violation. If this factor cannot easily be determined, the following may be considered:

a. Awareness of the violation;

b. Ability to correct the violation;

c. Ability to pay the damages, costs, and expenses;

d. Cooperation with governmental agencies;

e. Degree to which any impact or threatened impact on water or sediment quality, human health, the environment, or public or private property is related to acts or omissions by each responsible person;

f. Degree to which the responsible persons made good-faith efforts to avoid a violation or to mitigate its consequences; and

g. Other equitable factors.

H. Collection of Monetary Penalty and Abatement Costs.

1. The monetary penalty constitutes a personal obligation of the responsible person to whom the notice of violation is directed. Any monetary penalty assessed must be paid to the city at the permit center within 10 calendar days from the date of mailing of the hearing examiner’s decision or a notice from the city that penalties are due;

2. The city attorney or her designee is authorized to take appropriate action to collect the monetary penalty;

3. The city will take appropriate action to collect all monies spent by the city to abate existing violations of this chapter, permits or other approvals, correction notices, stop work orders, or notices of violation issued pursuant to this section. Those costs create a joint and several personal obligation. The city may collect these costs by turning the debt over to a collection agency, filing a civil lawsuit, filing a lien or other legal means;

4. The responsible person named in a notice of violation is not relieved of the duty to correct the violation by paying the penalty associated with such violations.

I. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other provision of the Milton Municipal Code or city ordinance providing for a civil penalty, this chapter shall control.

J. For the purposes of this code, whenever “civil infraction” and “civil penalty” are used in any code, ordinance or regulation of the city, these terms shall be deemed to have the same meaning as the terms “civil violation” and “monetary penalty,” respectively, as used herein.

K. If any one or more sections, subsections or sentences of this chapter are held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this chapter and the same shall remain in full force and effect.

L. Appeal provisions set forth in MMC 17.78.050 et seq. shall apply to appeals of notice of violation and stop work order issued pursuant to this section. Unless it is timely appealed to the hearing examiner, the notice of violation shall be final. (Ord. 1910 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 3 (Exh. B), 2015; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2006).

The decision of the public works director is appealable to the hearing examiner.

E. Water Service Design.

1. Water services shall be sized in accordance with the International Plumbing Code.

Certificates of water availability are defined as certificates issued by the city stating the ability to provide water to meet the needs of a proposed development project as contemplated in RCW 19.27.097, as now or hereafter amended. Certificates of water availability shall be submitted in conjunction with a land use permit application as required by MMC 17.61.020(C)(2)(d), as now or hereafter amended, or with a building permit application as required by RCW 19.27.097, as now or hereafter amended. Certificates of water availability shall not be required or allowed for any site-specific rezones, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of MMC 17.61.020(C) (2)(d). The land use permit applications identified in this section shall not be deemed complete for purposes of permit review deadlines until a valid certificate is submitted to the review authority. Certificates shall be issued only to meet the water needs of development proposed in a land use or building permit application. (Ord. 1704 § 1, 2007).


13.29.030 Expiration of certificates of water availability.

Certificates of water availability shall state that they shall only remain in effect for the later of (A) one year; or (B) during the pendency of any permit application for which the certificate has been submitted as required in MMC 13.29.020.

Certificates of water availability issued prior to August 15, 2007, that are associated with current development and building permit applications shall remain in effect unless and until such pending permit application expires or is deemed to be inactive, as defined elsewhere in the Milton Municipal Code. The city of Milton shall notify the holders of certificates without expiration dates issued prior to August 15, 2007, of the impending expiration by publishing a legal notice in the city’s official newspaper and posting the same on the city’s website. The city shall also send a copy of the legal notice by certified mail to each holder for whom the city has a mailing address and record of issuing a certificate of water availability without expiration date. (Ord. 1704 § 1, 2007).


13.29.040 Perfecting of water certificate.

Once a permit identified in MMC 13.29.020 is approved, the accompanying water certificate shall be perfected for the use proposed in the permit and the holder shall have a right to connect to the city’s water system. Certificates issued without an expiration date prior to August 15, 2007, shall be deemed perfected if issued for property upon which a land use or building permit application has been approved prior to August 15, 2007, but only to the extent necessary to meet the needs of the approved development. (Ord. 1704 § 1, 2007).


13.29.050 Fees for certificates of water availability.

Certificates of water availability shall only be issued upon payment of fees required in the fee resolution adopted pursuant to MMC 3.48.010. A new fund shall be created exclusively for fees collected for certificates of water availability. Expenditure of moneys in this fund shall be limited to the administration of water rights programs, including but not limited to administering letters of water availability and costs of securing new or maintaining existing water rights and securing new wells or increase capacity of existing wells to enable the city to continue to issue letters of water availability.

A $3.00 per month alternate address fee will be charged to the utility account for this service. Tenants will not receive prorated or partial bills. No billing will be sent to a tenant until all accounts for the property are in good standing, and payments are current. It is the sole responsibility of the property owner to notify the city of any change in tenants when additional billing copies have been requested.

B. Accounts are past due after the fifteenth day of the month following billing, or after the first business day following the fifteenth, if that date is on a weekend or holiday.

8. Utility service for residential space heating shall not be terminated between November 15th through March 15th if the customer:

a. Notifies the utility of the inability to pay the bill, including a security deposit. This notice should be provided within five business days of receiving a payment overdue notice unless there are extenuating circumstances. If the customer fails to notify the utility within five business days and service is terminated, the customer can, by paying reconnection charges, if any, and fulfilling the requirements of this section, receive the protections of this chapter;

b. Provides self-certification of household income for the prior 12 months to a grantee of the department of community, trade, and economic development, which administers federally funded energy assistance programs.

If the past due bill is not paid by the following October 15th, the customer shall not be eligible for protections under this chapter until the past due bill is paid. The plan shall not require monthly payments in excess of seven percent of the customer’s monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date the application is made and thereafter during November 15th through March 15th. A customer may agree to pay a higher percentage during this period, but shall not be in default unless payment during this period is less than seven percent of monthly income plus one-twelfth of any arrearage accrued from the date application is made and thereafter. If assistance payments are received by the customer subsequent to implementation of the plan, the customer shall contact the utility to reformulate the plan; and

f. Agrees to pay the moneys owed even if he or she moves.

d. Disconnect service if the customer fails to honor the payment program. Utilities may continue to disconnect service for those practices authorized by law other than nonpayment as provided for in this section. Customers who qualify for payment plans under this section who default on their payment plans and are disconnected can be reconnected and maintain the protections afforded under this chapter by paying reconnection charges, if any, and by paying all amounts that would have been due and owing under the terms of the applicable payment plan, absent default, on the date on which service is reconnected; and

e. Advise the customer in writing at the time it disconnects service that it will restore service if the customer contacts the utility and fulfils the other requirements of this section.

F. To reconnect a utility service which has been discontinued:

1. The account holder must pay the full balance due, including both past due and current amounts, plus a service fee.

2. Payments made after shut-off must be made in cash, by money order or by credit card or debit card.

3. Payments must be received before 4:00 p.m. for same day reconnections, and must include a $50.00 service fee. Utility reconnections will be made by close of each business day.

4. For same day connections on payments received after 4:00 p.m. there will be an additional fee of $185.00.

G. As feasible through the city’s billing program, the city will offer a budget billing plan. Under this plan, account holders may opt to have their utility billing averaged at a monthly payment amount, based on the previous year account history. Some account holders may choose this plan to avoid low and high balance spikes throughout the year.

1. An annual adjusting bill under this program would bill the account a higher or a lower amount, based on actual usage during the year.

2. At such adjusting bill cycle, budget plan accounts will be restructured for the ensuing year’s monthly payments, based on the account history for the year just completed.

H. Exemptions.

1. Individual Circumstances. If it is determined by the utility clerk and the finance director that an account has become past due because of circumstances beyond the control of the account holder, a time payment plan on the past due amount may be arranged, with one percent per month interest charged on past due amounts. This request must be submitted by the property owner.

2. Payments received insufficient to cover both current balances and the scheduled payment on past due amounts shall be credited first to the older balance.

3. In an effort to assist customers due to individual circumstances the finance director is authorized to accept short term arrangements to avoid discontinuation of services. This must be authorized by the property owner and cannot exceed 90 days.

I. Utility services, enforcement of lien, limitations on terminations of service for residential heating is subject to RCW 35.21.300.

J. Corrections and Adjustments.

1. The finance director with concurrence from the public works director has the authority to authorize the correction of billing errors and to make adjustments to utility accounts as necessary as a result of billing errors, or for expediency. Any adjustment in excess of $1,000 must also be approved by the mayor or their designee.

13.36.020 Rates for senior and disabled citizens.

A. All senior and disabled citizens that qualify shall be allowed a discount of 30 percent off both monthly water and monthly electric utility standard rate billings. This discount applies to residential customers only. 

B. A senior citizen is considered to be anyone over the age of 62. A disabled citizen is considered to be anyone meeting the definition of “disabled” as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To be eligible for the senior or disabled citizen discount, a citizen must meet the above definitions as well as the low-income criteria, defined as someone earning 50 percent below the median family income for Pierce County based upon the most current income data furnished by Pierce County housing authority.

13.42.030 Applicability.

A. This chapter establishes the framework for developing and conducting a school impact fee program, including the formula under which the dollar amount of school impact fees shall be determined. Before the school impact fee program is implemented, the following shall occur:

1. City adoption of a capital facilities plan element relating to school facilities based upon the school district capital facilities plan adopted by the district. See adoption by reference at MMC 13.42.040.

2. City approval of an interlocal agreement between the city the participating district, providing for:

a. The procedure for collecting school impact fees;

b. The accounting of fee collections and expenditures;

c. The respective duties of the district and the city for the defense and liabilities involved in any legal actions relating to the school impact fee program;

d. The funding of the administrative costs of the school impact fee program; and

e. Any other necessary or appropriate topic involving the respective duties and liabilities of the district and city relating to the school impact fee program.

B. This chapter shall apply to all forms of residential development activity requiring city review or approval that create new residential building lots or new dwelling units; provided, however, the following development activity is excluded from this chapter on the grounds it does not create an impact on school facilities:

1. Any dwelling unit subject to restrictions that may be legally enforced by a private party or governmental entity limiting occupants exclusively to elderly residents or other populations that do not include children of the ages five to 21 years old, including nursing homes and retirement centers, and facilities defined as transient accommodations, such as hotels or motels, under Chapter 70.62 RCW and WAC 248-144-020(26); provided, however, this exclusion ceases if the housing is later converted to use as a single-family or multifamily residence not subject to such restrictions;

2. Reconstruction or remodeling of existing single-family or multifamily residences that do not result in additional dwelling units; or

3. Building permit applications for mobile or manufactured homes sited on a lot that:

a. Prior to the effective date of the implementing fee ordinance, a mobile home, manufactured home, or other single-family residence existed; provided, however, the siting of the home replaces the former residence and does not increase the number of dwelling units; or

b. Has previously been determined to require and paid a school impact fee. (Ord. 1314 § 1, 1996).


13.42.040 School district capital facilities plan.

A. For purposes of this chapter, the Fife School District 417 “Capital Facilities Plan 2018-2024” adopted by the Fife School District on July 30, 2018, is adopted by reference as though set forth herein in full.

B. On at least an annual basis, the city shall review the school district’s capital facilities plan for the purpose of considering revisions to the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan to insure that the plan element and fee schedules reflect current conditions. (Ord. 1949 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1926 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1898 § 2, 2016; Ord. 1847 § 2, 2014; Ord. 1807 § 3, 2013; Ord. 1314 § 1, 1996).


13.42.050 Determination of impact fee schedules.

Repealed by Ord. 1949. (Ord. 1314 § 1, 1996).


13.42.060 Determination and collection of impact fees.

A. The department shall determine and collect impact fees as follows:

1. School impact fees shall be paid directly from the developer to the school district. Upon receipt of impact fees, the school district shall issue the developer a receipt identifying the amount of impact fees paid and the development project for which the fees are paid. Unless a deferral is granted pursuant to MMC 13.42.100, the city of Milton shall not issue any building permit until it receives a receipt from the school district establishing that any required school impact fees have been paid to the district. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to ensure that the city receives a copy of the receipt.

2. The current impact fee amounts for Fife School District No. 417 are:

	Single-Family Resident:	$3,500

	Multifamily/Duplex Residential Unit:	$2,200

Starting on September 1, 2019, and each September 1st thereafter, said fees may increase in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Engineering News-Record annual construction cost index.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, this chapter is not intended to preclude the city from regulating development activity under other city ordinances, such as zoning ordinances and land use policies, environmental regulations, or subdivision ordinances, or Chapter 58.17 RCW, on the grounds that the development activity fails to make adequate provisions for schools or school grounds or has a significant adverse impact on public education; provided, however, that pursuant to Chapter 219 of the 1992 Washington Laws, no person shall be required to pay a fee under such regulations to pay the costs of school district system improvements funded, in part, by impact fees imposed under this chapter. (Ord. 1949 § 3, 2018; Ord. 1926 § 3, 2017; Ord. 1898 § 3, 2016; Ord. 1847 § 3, 2014; Ord. 1807 § 4, 2013; Ord. 1694 § 1, 2007; Ord. 1518 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1314 § 1, 1996).


13.42.070 Adjustments, credits and appeals.

A. If development activity is granted approval by the city subject to a condition that the developer provide a school site or facility acceptable to the district, or the district and developer agree in writing to an impact fee credit for monetary or other contributions to the district, the developer shall be entitled to a facilities credit against the fee imposed under the formula provided by this chapter. The credit shall be allocated on a pro rata basis to the lots or projects in the proposed development activity. The cost of construction or value of the developer’s contribution shall be established at the time of city approval or in the written agreement between the developer and the district.

B. A developer shall receive a facilities credit against the impact fee for the amount of any payment made to the school district pursuant to a voluntary agreement for the development activity or lot in question executed or imposed prior to the effective date of an implementing fee ordinance; provided, however, the impact fee shall be adjusted to the amount specified in any such voluntary agreement and the fee satisfied by the credit provided herein if the agreement provided that the district would accept the payments under it in lieu of any fee imposed under a subsequently enacted impact fee ordinance; and provided further, no impact fee or portion thereof shall be imposed if it would violate Chapter 219 of the 1992 Washington Laws.

C. School impact fees may be adjusted by the city in the interest of fairness pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(4) and 82.02.070(5), subject to the appeal rights set forth in subsection F of this section, if one or more of the following circumstances exist:

1. The developer demonstrates that the fee determination was incorrectly calculated;

2. Unusual circumstances unique to the property or nature of the development identified by the developer demonstrate that if the standard impact fee amount was applied to the development, it would be unfair because the development activity will not create an impact on the need for additional school facilities to the extent calculated by the impact fee formula; or

3. Studies or other data submitted for the particular development activity demonstrate that adjustment of any of the fee calculation factors set forth in Attachment A is necessary because the data used in the formula may not be appropriately applied to the development activity under review.

Any developer seeking a reduction of the impact fee must demonstrate the need for such an adjustment by a preponderance of the evidence. No fee adjustment shall be granted based on circumstances personal to the developer seeking the adjustment or on the grounds of financial hardship.

D. A request for a fee adjustment or credit shall be submitted to the department within 30 days from the filing of the application or event that triggers the determination of the impact fee. The department shall notify the district of any request for an adjustment or credit and the district shall be entitled to submit a response to the request. The department shall make an administrative determination on the adjustment request and serve it upon the developer and district.

E. The developer or the district may appeal the department’s determination concerning a request for an adjustment or credit in the course of any subsequent proceeding before the hearing examiner concerning the underlying application for the development activity; provided, however, that the determination is served on the developer and district not less than 10 working days before the hearing date. If the determination is not served within this time, or if no hearing examiner proceeding is otherwise available for the development activity, the developer or the district may submit an appeal to the hearing examiner within 30 days from service of the determination using the appeal procedure for variances (with the exception that notices to surrounding owners and other provisions inapplicable to the fee dispute shall not apply).

F. Impact fees may be paid under protest pending a developer appeal. The district may also appeal, and the developer may proceed upon payment of the disputed determination; provided, however, if a fee is paid pending an appeal, the development activity authorized under the approval or permit is conditional upon the final resolution of the appeal. (Ord. 1314 § 1, 1996).


13.42.080 Impact fee accounts and refunds.

A. Impact fee receipts shall be paid directly to the school district and earmarked specifically to be retained in a special interest-bearing account established for the district’s school impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes identified in subsection B of this section.

B. Impact fees for the district’s system improvements shall be expended by the district for capital improvements including but not limited to school planning, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, relocatable facilities, capital equipment pertaining to educational facilities, and any other expenses which could be capitalized, and which are consistent with the school district’s capital facilities plan.

C. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with the provisions of bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.

D. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the district for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the school district, unless there exists an extraordinary and compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified to the city by the district. The city must prepare written findings concurring with the district’s reasons, and authorizing the later encumbrance or expenditure of the fees prior to the district so encumbering or expending the funds, or directing a refund of the fees.

E. The current owner of the property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within six years of receipt of the funds by the city. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis. The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the city tax records.

F. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the city in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of the impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.

G. Should the city seek to terminate any or all school impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a school impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the district, consistent with the provisions of this section and the interlocal agreement. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

H. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the district on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 1807 § 5, 2013; Ord. 1314 § 1, 1996).


13.42.100 Deferral of impact fees.

In accordance with ESB 5923(2015), an applicant may request, at any time prior to building permit issuance, and consistent with the requirements of this section, to defer the payment of an impact fee for a residential development unit. The following shall apply to any request to defer payment of an impact fee:

A. For each single-family residence for which any impact fee deferral is applied for, an administrative fee must be paid to the city due to the increased burden placed on city staff for processing and monitoring such deferral.

B. A separate application must be submitted for each single-family residence being constructed. Only the first 20 applications per calendar year by each applicant for impact fee deferral are eligible for impact fee deferral under this chapter.

The period of deferral expires at the earliest of:

1. The time of final inspection by the city; or

2. Eighteen months after the building permit is issued by the city.

C. The applicant must grant and record in favor of the city of Milton an impact fee lien in the amount of the deferred impact fee. The lien must be in a form signed, dated and approved by the city attorney, and signed by all owners of the property and persons or entities holding any interest in the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed, and recorded among the appropriate land records of the county. Proof of such recording shall be submitted to the city before a building permit may be issued. The lien must specify that it is binding on all successors in title after the recordation. The lien may specify that it is subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the applicant. A mortgage, deed of trust or other financing mechanism shall be limited to the property upon which construction of one single-family residence will occur. A lien not paid when due shall bear interest at the statutory rate. A lien shall become due at the expiration of the deferral date.

D. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with ESB 5923(2015), the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

E. After full payment of impact fees, and upon written request of the person paying said fees containing the name and address of the requester together with a copy of a proposed lien release form, the city, upon approval by the city attorney, shall sign a lien release and deliver it to the person paying said fee either in person or by first class mail.

13.44.040 Establishment of service area.

The city establishes as the service area for development impact fees the city of Milton, including all property located within the corporate limits of the city. The scope of the service area is hereby found to be reasonable and established on the basis of sound planning and engineering principles. (Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.050 Imposition of impact fee on development activity.

A. The city authorizes the assessment and collection of impact fees on development activity within the city, at the rate established in MMC 13.44.065. It is declared that such impact fees shall:

1. Only be imposed for transportation system improvements that are reasonably related to new development;

2. Not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, reasonably related to new development;

3. Be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit new development;

4. Not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in any previously constructed system improvements. Such impact fee schedule is based upon the formula for calculating the proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, necessitated by new development to be borne by impact fees. The formula is described in the 2015 transportation impact fee study, which is adopted herein by this reference.

B. The impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be paid in whole as a condition of approval of future residential developments and binding site plans; and, for all other development activities, at the time of issuance of the building permit unless a deferral is granted pursuant to MMC 13.44.100. Impact fees shall be assessed and paid at those rates in effect at the time of payment, and not at time of development activity application.

C. Unless a deferral is granted pursuant to MMC 13.44.100, failure to pay the impact fees for a given development activity at the time of assessment shall result in denial of the development activity approval and/or building permit for which the owner has applied.

D. If, as a condition of approval of development activity, the owner dedicates land, or constructs system improvements, in excess of the proportionate share of system improvements attributable to the owner’s development activity as set out in the city’s development regulations, the developer shall be eligible for a credit towards the transportation impact fees otherwise payable under this chapter. The amount of such credit shall be calculated based on the predevelopment fair market value of such land or improvements required in excess of the owner’s share and shall be deducted from the transportation impact fees charged under this chapter. Credits that are granted may not exceed the total amount of the fee due.

E. The public works director may adjust the amount of the impact fee otherwise imposed in this chapter with respect to specific development activity upon determining that:

1. Unusual circumstances require such adjustments to ensure that such impact fees are imposed fairly; and

2. Studies and data submitted by the owner regarding the impacts of such owner’s proposed development activity require such adjustment to ensure that such impact’s fees are imposed fairly. Impact fees shall not be deemed unfair unless such unusual circumstances and studies and data support a finding that the impact fees otherwise imposed in this chapter allocate to the specific project in question vehicle trips and resulting share of the cost of the systems improvements reasonably related to new development activities that are greater than or substantially less than such development activity’s allocable proportionate share of such trips and resulting costs. (Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.060 Disposition of impact fee revenues.

A. A fund is hereby created for receipt of impact fees.

B. The impact fees collected pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be deposited into the fund. Pending application as provided in this chapter, the moneys deposited in the accounts of the fund shall be invested in any investment authorized for the investment of city funds. All interest and profits derived from the investments of moneys in each account in the impact fee fund shall be retained in such account.

C. The impact fees deposited in the fund, and the interest and profit received from the investments therefrom, shall be expended only for public facilities of the type for which such impact fees were collected, in conformity with the city’s comprehensive plan, capital facilities plan element, and 2015 transportation impact fee study and expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt by the city, unless written findings by the city council identify an extraordinary and compelling reason for the city to hold the fees for a longer time. The city shall account for annual expenditures and shall comply with this section in successive comprehensive plans, transportation plans and capital facilities plans as appropriate.

D. The city shall prepare an annual report on the fund which shows the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received and the public facilities that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. (Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.065 Impact fees – Calculation.

A. The impact fee for each p.m. peak hour trip, as set forth in the 2015 transportation impact fee study and adjusted in accordance with subsection B of this section, is $4,380. Each development activity shall be subject to and pay an impact fee based on the p.m. peak hour trips attributable to the development activity.

B. The fees provided in the transportation impact study are based on 2015 cost estimates. The fees are to be adjusted annually by applying the Engineering News-Record annual construction cost index to the cost per trip fee amount. Calculation of the construction cost index adjustment shall be included with the annual transportation improvement program update and adopted by resolution.

C. Development traffic volumes shall be calculated by the forecast method set out in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. A development will provide a traffic trip generation study that identifies weekday total volumes and p.m. peak hour volumes. The development traffic study shall be provided by a practicing Washington traffic engineer.

D. The impact fees will be calculated by multiplying the p.m. peak hour volume times the transportation impact fee cost per trip. (Ord. 1982 § 2, 2020; Ord. 1972 § 2, 2019; Ord. 1944 § 2, 2018; Ord. 1922 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.070 Refunds.

A. The city shall refund, to the current owners of property on which an impact fee has been paid, any impact fees paid with respect to such property that have not been expended or encumbered for public facilities of the type of which such impact fees were collected within 10 years from the date of receipt or such longer period of time as is established in the event that the city council finds that an extraordinary or compelling reason exists to hold the fees longer than 10 years as provided in MMC 13.44.060. Impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis. The city shall notify potential refund claimants by first class mail deposited within the United States Postal Service at the last known address of the claimants.

B. The city shall also refund to the current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid all impact fees paid with respect to such property if the development activity for which the impact fee was imposed did not occur within 10 years from the date of receipt or such longer period of time as is established and no impact has resulted; provided, that if some, but not all, of the development activity for which the impact fee was imposed occurred, the impact will be deemed to have occurred, and no refund shall be available under this section.

C. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of impact fees to the city clerk or designee within one year of the date of the right to claim the refund arises, which, for purposes of refund claims authorized pursuant to subsection B of this section only, shall be the date of voluntary or involuntary abandonment of the building permit, or the date that notice is given as provided in subsection A of this section, whichever occurs later. Refunds of impact fees shall include interest and any profits earned on the impact fees from the date of their receipt to the date of refund, as a percentage of the interest/profits earned by the fund on an annual basis. Any impact fees not expended within the time limitations described in MMC 13.44.060 and for which no application for a refund has been made within the one-year claim period shall be retained by the city and expended on public facilities of the type for which such impact fees were initially collected, without further limitation as to the time of expenditure.

D. In the event a refund is made by the city pursuant to this section, the city may, but is not required to, review the original approval or authorization for which the impact fees had been paid under this chapter. Refund of the impact fees shall be deemed to be a change in conditions which allows for review of the development activity for which approval was previously given. Review of such development activity shall be governed by the provisions of local and state law. (Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.080 Appeals.

A. An owner may pay an impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter under protest in order to obtain development activity approval and after such payment may file an appeal regarding the amount of such impact fee in accordance with this section. Pending the completion of the appeal process as set forth herein, no building permits shall be issued for any development activity for which the impact fees about which appeal is being sought were imposed unless a deferral is granted pursuant to MMC 13.44.100.

B. The determination of the public works director or designee regarding the applicability of the impact fee to a given development activity within the service area shall be final. The hearing examiner shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in the public works director’s or designee’s determination of the impact fee imposed upon a development activity pursuant to this chapter.

C. Appeal to the hearing examiner regarding the amount of the impact fee imposed on any development activity may only be taken by the owner of the property where such development activity shall occur. No appeal shall be permitted unless and until the impact fee at issue has been paid. Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, not exceeding 10 days after the date the impact fee was paid, and in the case of subdivisions or short plats, prior to the recording of the final plat. An appeal shall be commenced on filing with the city clerk or designee a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof and depositing an appeal filing fee of $250.00. The city clerk or designee shall forthwith transfer to the city council all papers constituting the record upon which the amount of the impact fee was determined.

D. The hearing examiner shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties of interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time of the hearing. Any party may appear in person or by agent or through his/her attorney.

E. In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the hearing examiner may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partially, or may modify the determination of the amount of the impact fee appealed from only upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principle of fairness, and may make such order, requirements, decisions or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers with respect to the determination of the impact fees as they are granted to the city pursuant to this chapter.

F. Any person or persons, or any board, taxpayer or department or division of the city, aggrieved by any decision of the hearing examiner may seek review by a court of record of such decisions, in the manner provided by the laws of the state of Washington. (Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.090 Reimbursement agreements authorized.

A. In the event public facilities are inadequate to support a proposed development activity, the city may deny approval of such activity. Alternatively, the city is authorized to enter into reimbursement agreements under Chapter 35.72 RCW.

B. The city is authorized to enter into agreements with owners, consistent with RCW 35.43.184, to provide for LID preformation activity. (Ord. 1899 § 2, 2016).


13.44.100 Deferral of impact fees.

In accordance with ESB 5923(2015), an applicant may request, at any time prior to building permit issuance, and consistent with the requirements of this section, to defer the payment of an impact fee for a residential development unit. The following shall apply to any request to defer payment of an impact fee:

A. For each single-family residence for which any impact fee deferral is applied for, an administrative fee set in the fee schedule must simultaneously be paid to the city due to the increased burden placed on city staff for processing and monitoring such deferral.

B. A separate application must be submitted for each single-family residence being constructed. Only the first 20 applications per calendar year by each applicant for impact fee deferral are eligible for impact fee deferral under this chapter.

C. The period of deferral expires at the earliest of:

1. The time of final inspection by the city; or

2. Eighteen months after the building permit is issued by the city.

D. The applicant must grant and record in favor of the city of Milton an impact fee lien in the amount of the deferred impact fee. The lien must be in a form signed, dated and approved by the city attorney, and signed by all owners of the property and persons or entities holding any interest in the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed, and recorded among the appropriate land records of the county. Proof of such recording shall be submitted to the city before a building permit may be issued. The lien must specify that it is binding on all successors in title after the recordation. The lien may specify that it is subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the applicant. A mortgage, deed of trust or other financing mechanism shall be limited to the property upon which construction of one single-family residence will occur. A lien not paid when due shall bear interest at the statutory rate. A lien shall become due at the expiration of the deferral date.

E. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with ESB 5923(2015), the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

F. After full payment of impact fees, and upon written request of the person paying said fees containing the name and address of the requester together with a copy of a proposed lien release form, the city, upon approval by the city attorney, shall sign a lien release and deliver it to the person paying said fee either in person or by first class mail.

Failure to pay shall result in the following:

1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of MMC 1.08.100. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying MMC 1.08.100, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.

B. Feepayers may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the rate set forth in MMC 13.45.030. Such feepayers shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

C. A nonreimbursable administrative fee shall be charged for each independent fee calculation. The fee shall be deposited with the city to pay for city review of the independent fee calculation upon submittal of the documented independent fee study.

D. After the city completes its review, the actual fees and expenses will be determined and the cash deposit shall be adjusted to provide for a refund by the city or additional payment by the feepayer.

E. While there is a presumption that the amounts set forth in MMC 13.45.030 are valid, the director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer, but is not required to accept such documentation which the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or where adjustment is deemed by the director to be appropriate based on principles of fairness under the circumstances of the case.

F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the office of the hearing examiner subject to the procedures set forth in Chapter 17.71 MMC. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.050 Credits and adjustments.

A. A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for parks and recreation impact fees be awarded to him/her for parks and recreation improvement projects provided by the feepayer in excess of the standard requirements for the feepayer’s development if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are identified as parks and recreation system improvements that provide capacity to serve new growth in the capital facilities plan, or the director, at his/her discretion, makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the parks and recreation goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan.

B. For each request for a credit or credits, the director shall determine the value of dedicated land by using available documentation or selecting an appraiser from a list of independent appraisers maintained by the department to determine the value of the land being dedicated. The value of improvements will be determined through documentation submitted by the feepayer.

C. The feepayer shall pay the cost of the appraisal and shall deposit on account the estimated cost of the appraisal as determined by the city at the time the feepayer requests consideration for a credit.

D. After receiving the appraisal, the director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, where applicable, the legal description of the site donated, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit.

E. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.

F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in Chapter 17.71 MMC.

G. Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the fee rate in MMC 13.45.030 has been reasonably adjusted for other revenue sources which are earmarked for, or proratable to, funding parks and recreation facilities.

H. In order to grandfather the capacity rights of existing developments, the director will utilize the adopted rates to calculate any impact fee credits and to determine any surplus credits for off-site system improvements made by the property owner.

Only in a situation when a property owner makes off-site system capacity improvements that qualify in accordance with subsection A of this section will any surplus credits (value computed during the permit year and not adjusted for inflation) remain with the property or any subdivision of that property to benefit future development where a parks and recreation impact fee is determined to be due. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.060 Exemptions.

Appeals regarding the impact fees imposed on any development activity may only be made by the feepayer of the property where such development activity will occur. No appeal submitted under protest shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at issue have been paid. Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the director without first paying the fees, providing the applicant is willing to provide a satisfactory security of the appealed fee amount in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 17.71 MMC prior to issuance of the building permit. Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the director without first paying the fees, provided the applicant is willing to postpone issuance of the building permit until after the appeal process when the revised final fee is known.

B. Determinations of the director with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or value of a credit, or the director’s decision with respect to the independent fee calculation, or any other determination which the director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, can be appealed to the hearing examiner.

C. Appeals shall be taken within 10 days of the director’s issuance of a written determination by filing with the office of the hearing examiner a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof and depositing the necessary fee, which is set forth in the existing fee schedules for appeals of administrative decisions. The director shall transmit to the office of the hearing examiner all papers constituting the record for the determination, including, where appropriate, the independent fee calculation.

D. The hearing examiner shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal, give notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same as provided in Chapter 2.54 MMC. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.

E. The hearing examiner is authorized to make findings of fact regarding the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or amount of the credit, or the accuracy or applicability of an independent fee calculation. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, except as provided in subsection G of this section.

F. The hearing examiner may, so long as such action is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the determinations of the director with respect to the amount of the impact fees imposed or the credit awarded upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principles of fairness, and may make such order, requirements, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers which have been granted to the director by this chapter.

G. Any feepayer aggrieved by any decision of the office of the hearing examiner may appeal the hearing examiner’s final decision as provided in Chapter 2.54 MMC. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.080 Establishment of impact fee account for parks and recreation.

A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and deposited in special interest-bearing accounts. The fees received shall be prudently invested in a manner consistent with the investment policies of the city.

B. There is hereby established a separate impact fee account for the fees collected pursuant to this chapter: the parks and recreation facilities impact fee account. Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used in accordance with the provisions of MMC 13.45.100. Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected.

C. On an annual basis, the financial director shall provide a report to the council on the parks and recreation impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the parks and recreation system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.

D. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings an extraordinary and compelling reason or reasons for the delay. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.090 Refunds.

A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within 10 years of when the fees were paid or, where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as established pursuant to MMC 13.45.080, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis; provided, that any party that voluntarily elects to use the alternative fee payment method specified in MMC 13.45.030 shall sign as a condition of use of the alternative fee payment method a waiver of right on a form prepared and provided by the city to recovery of park impact fees not spent within the statutory 10-year time frame.

B. The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant or claimant must be the owner of the property.

C. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the director within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.

D. Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on the appropriate parks and recreation facilities.

E. Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city.

F. If and when the city seeks to terminate any or all components of the parks and recreation impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail to the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the appropriate parks and recreation facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within an account or accounts being terminated.

G. The city shall also refund to the developer of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.100 Use of funds.

A. Pursuant to this chapter, impact fees:

1. Shall be used for parks and recreation system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development; and

2. Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in parks and recreation facilities serving existing developments; and

3. Shall not be used for maintenance or operations.

B. As a general guideline, parks and recreation impact fees may be used for any parks and recreation system improvements which could otherwise be funded by a bond issue of the city.

C. Parks and recreation facilities impact fees may be spent for parks and recreation system improvements, including but not limited to neighborhood and community parks, recreational trails, athletic fields, swimming pools, and community centers, including planning, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements including mitigation, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, applicable impact fees or mitigation costs, and any other expenses which can be capitalized.

D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of parks and recreation system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.110 Review and update of impact fees.

A. The fee rate schedules set forth in MMC 13.45.030 shall be reviewed by the council no later than two years after the effective date of the fee rate schedule attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, and no more than every two years thereafter.

B. The rates set forth in MMC 13.45.030 shall be reviewed by the council as it may deem necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the annual update of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.120 Deferral of impact fees.

In accordance with ESB 5923 (2015), an applicant may request, at any time prior to building permit issuance, and consistent with the requirements of this section, to defer the payment of an impact fee for a residential development unit. The following shall apply to any request to defer payment of an impact fee:

A. For each single-family residence for which any impact fee deferral is applied for, an administrative fee must be paid to the city due to the increased burden placed on city staff for processing and monitoring such deferral.

B. A separate application must be submitted for each single-family residence being constructed. Only the first 20 applications per calendar year by each applicant for impact fee deferral are eligible for impact fee deferral under this chapter.

The period of deferral expires at the earliest of:

1. The time of final inspection by the city; or

2. Eighteen months after the building permit is issued by the city.

C. The applicant must grant and record in favor of the city of Milton an impact fee lien in the amount of the deferred impact fee. The lien must be in a form signed, dated and approved by the city attorney, and signed by all owners of the property and persons or entities holding any interest in the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed, and recorded among the appropriate land records of the county. Proof of such recording shall be submitted to the city before a building permit may be issued. The lien must specify that it is binding on all successors in title after the recordation. The lien may specify that it is subordinate to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property granted by the applicant. A mortgage, deed of trust or other financing mechanism shall be limited to the property upon which construction of one single-family residence will occur. A lien not paid when due shall bear interest at the statutory rate. A lien shall become due at the expiration of the deferral date.

D. If impact fees are not paid in accordance with ESB 5923(2015), the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with Chapter 61.12 RCW.

E. After full payment of impact fees, and upon written request of the person paying said fees containing the name and address of the requester together with a copy of a proposed lien release form, the city, upon approval by the city attorney, shall sign a lien release and deliver it to the person paying said fee either in person or by first class mail. (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).


13.45.130 Miscellaneous provisions.

A. Existing Authority Unimpaired. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the feepayer or the proponent of a development activity to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the underlying development approval process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent with the provisions of RCW 82.02.050(1)(c).

B. Captions. The chapter and section captions used in this chapter are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this chapter.

C. Severability. If any portion of this chapter is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such finding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section of this chapter.

D. Short Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “the city of Milton parks and recreation impact fee ordinance.” (Ord. 1903 § 2, 2016).

15.03.010 Purpose and findings.

The city council of the city of Milton finds that unsafe, unsanitary, vacant and otherwise improperly maintained premises and structures within the city of Milton, in addition to the obvious hazards which these conditions pose to the public health, safety and welfare, adversely affect the value, utility and habitability of property within the city as a whole and specifically cause substantial damage to adjoining and nearby property. This chapter is an exercise of the city’s police power, and it shall be liberally construed to effect this purpose. This chapter shall also be construed in accord with Chapter 35.80 RCW, as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1677 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.010).

Gender and number are interchangeable. Defined terms or concepts from MMC Title 17 generally apply to this chapter.

A. “Abandoned” refers to any property, real or personal, which is unattended and either open or unsecured so that admittance may be gained without damaging any portion of the property, or which evidences indicia that no person is presently in possession, e.g., disconnected utilities, accumulated debris, uncleanliness, disrepair and, in the case of chattels, location. Length of time or any particular state of mind of the owner or person entitled to possession is not conclusive in determining that property is abandoned.

B. “Boarded up building” means any building the exterior openings of which are closed by extrinsic devices or some other manner designed or calculated to be permanent, giving the appearance the building is not used or occupied.

C. “Building” means any building, dwelling, structure, or mobile home, factory-built house, or part thereof, built for the support, shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, chattels or property of any kind.

D. “Director” means the planning and community development director, his authorized deputies and representatives.

E. “Hearing examiner” means the hearing examiner of the city of Milton as provided in Chapter 2.54 MMC.

F. “Health officer” means the head of either the Tacoma-Pierce County health department or Seattle-King County health department, his authorized deputies or representatives.

G. “Nuisance” includes a nuisance defined by statute or ordinance; or a nuisance at common law, either public or private.

H. “Owner” means any person having any interest in the real or personal property in question as shown upon the records of the office of the Pierce or King County auditor, or who establishes his interest before the director or hearing examiner. For the purpose of giving notice, the term “owner” also includes any person in physical possession.

I. “Person” means natural person, joint venture, joint stock company, partnership, association, club, company, corporation, business trust, organization, or the manager, lessee, agent, servant, officer or employee of any of them.

J. “Repeat violation” means a violation of the same regulation in any location by the same person for which voluntary compliance has been sought within two years, or a notice of violation has been issued within two years.

K. “Vacant” when referring to a building means a commercial structure that is not actively and commercially in use for more than six months, an industrial or warehouse structure that is not actively in use for more than one year and residential property that is not actively in use as a residence for more than four months. “Vacant” when referring to real property with no commercial, industrial or residential structure refers to property that is not maintained, weed infested, overgrown, littered, or otherwise not maintained as are surrounding properties. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1663 §§ 6, 7, 2006; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.020).


15.03.030 Duties of the director.

The director’s duties and powers for the purposes of this chapter include:

A. Investigation of all buildings, properties and premises which he has reasonable grounds to believe may be unfit, substandard, boarded up, abandoned, vacant or a nuisance;

B. Preparation, service and posting of complaints against buildings, property or premises believed to be in violation;

C. Conducting administrative hearings and rendering decisions based upon written findings; and

D. Doing all things necessary and proper to carry out and enforce this chapter. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.030). 


15.03.040 Unfit buildings.

A. In reaching a judgment that a building is unfit for human habitation, the director shall consider:

1. Dilapidation;

2. Disrepair;

3. Structural defects;

4. Defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities, such as parts standing or attached in such manner as to be likely to fall and cause damage or injury;

5. Inadequate ventilation;

6. Uncleanliness;

7. Inadequate light;

8. Inadequate sanitary facilities;

9. Inadequate drainage;

10. Substandard conditions.

B. If these or other conditions are found to exist to an extent dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the building’s occupants, or the occupants of neighboring buildings or of other residents of the city of Milton, and if (1) structural deterioration is of such degree that (a) vertical members list, lean or buckle to the extent that a plumb line passing through the center of gravity falls outside the middle third of its base, or (b) 33 percent of the supporting members show damage or deterioration; or (2) the cost of restoration exceeds 60 percent of the value of the building; or (3) the building has been damaged by fire or other calamity, the cost of restoration exceeds 30 percent of the value of the building and it has remained vacant for six months or more (value shall be determined by reference to a current edition of “Building Valuation Data” published by the International Conference of Building Officials or, if not published, as determined by the director; cost of restoration is the actual estimated cost, which may be determined in the same manner as “value”), the director shall order the building or premises demolished and the land suitably filled and cleared, or shall order the property immediately vacated and secured as completely as possible pending demolition.

C. An undertaking entered into, at or prior to the hearing, by a party in interest creates a presumption that the building or premises can be reasonably repaired. The failure to accomplish such an undertaking within 30 calendar days is grounds for the director to order demolition. If by reason of any of the above conditions a building is unfit, but no public necessity is found for its immediate demolition, the director may take other action, such as causing the property to be cleaned, cleared, vacated, secured or otherwise repaired, which will promote the public health, safety or general welfare. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.040).


15.03.050 Substandard buildings.

A. In reaching a judgment that a building or premises is substandard, the director shall be guided by such factors as:

1. Structural unsoundness;

2. Improper sanitation;

3. Improper safety;

4. Improper weatherproofing;

5. Defective or hazardous wiring, including wiring which:

a. Did not conform with law applicable at the time of installation; or

a. Did not conform with law applicable at the time of installation; or

b. Has not been maintained in good and safe condition;

8. Fire hazard, including any building, device, apparatus, equipment, combustible waste or debris, or vegetation which may cause fire or explosion or provide ready fuel to augment the spread or intensity thereof;

9. Nuisance.

B. If these or similar conditions are found to exist, the director shall order the building or premises repaired, cleaned, cleared or otherwise brought into compliance with current codes, and may order the property vacated and secured as completely as possible pending such repair or other action. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.050).

Any complainant or person affected by the violation may appear and present evidence. The city shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of evidence that a violation has occurred and that the required corrective action is reasonable.

C. Within 10 days of the completion of the hearing the director shall issue an order to the owner that contains the following information:

1. The decision regarding the alleged violation including findings of fact and conclusions based thereon.

15.03.090 Hearings before the hearing examiner.

A. The purpose of the hearing examiner is to review the proceedings and orders of the director and to affirm, modify or vacate said orders.

B. Within 30 days from the date of service and posting of an order of the director, an owner may file an appeal with the hearing examiner by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk setting out the reasons he believes the findings or order of the director to be erroneous. The hearing examiner shall set a hearing not less than 10 nor more than 30 days from the date of said appeal or referral. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be made in accord with MMC 15.03.070. The matter of the appeal will be scheduled for public hearing before the hearing examiner so as to allow 10 days’ notice of the hearing to the appellant and all interested parties and to permit final decision thereon to be made within 60 days after the filing of the appeal. The filing of the notice of appeal shall stay the order of the director, except so much thereof as requires temporary measures, such as securing of the building to minimize any emergent danger to the public health or safety.

C. Upon the public hearing of the appeal, the hearing examiner shall consider the file of the proceedings before the director and such other evidence as may be presented. After the hearing, the hearing examiner may affirm, modify or vacate the order of the director, or may continue the matter for further deliberation or presentation of additional evidence. Normally, the hearing examiner will not accept new evidence or evidence not made available to the director in the absence of good cause. The hearing examiner’s review is on the record, not de novo.

The hearing examiner shall cause his findings of fact and order to be made in writing; provided, the hearing examiner may adopt the findings and order of the director, or so much thereof as supports his decision.

(Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.090).


15.03.100 Enforcement.

A. The order of the director or the hearing examiner may prescribe times within which demolition shall be commenced or completed. If the action is not commenced or completed within the prescribed time, or if no time is prescribed within the time for appeal, the director may cause the building to be demolished and the premises to be suitably filled and cleared as provided by MMC 15.03.040. If satisfactory progress has been made and sufficient evidence is presented that the work will be completed within a reasonable time, the director or the hearing examiner may extend the time for completion of the work. If satisfactory or substantial progress has not been made, the director or the hearing examiner may cause the building to be demolished and the premises suitably filled and cleared as provided by MMC 15.03.040. The director shall let bids for any demolition in accordance with MMC 15.03.110.

B. If other action ordered by the director or the hearing examiner is not taken within the time prescribed, or if no time is specified within the time for appeal, the director may cause the action to be taken by the city.

C. If the director deems it necessary to have the building secured as an interim measure for the protection of the public health and welfare while pending action, he may so order. If the owner is unable or unwilling to secure the building within 48 hours, the director may order the building secured by the city, at the expense of the owner. A structure so secured shall be assessed the fee for a boarded up or vacant structure.

D. If the owner is unable to comply with the director’s or hearing examiner’s order within the time required, and the time for appeals to the hearing examiner or petition to the court has passed, he may, for good and sufficient cause beyond his control, request in writing an extension of time. The director or the hearing examiner may grant a reasonable extension of time after a finding that the delay was beyond the control of the owners. There shall be no appeal or petition from the director’s or the hearing examiner’s ruling on an extension of time. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2002. Formerly 8.24.100).


15.03.110 Costs.

A. 1. The costs of abatement, repair, alteration or improvement, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition, when borne by the city, shall be assessed against the real property upon which such costs were incurred unless said costs were previously paid. The director shall forward such costs to the city clerk-treasurer, who shall certify them to the county treasurer for assessment on the tax rolls.

2. Bids for demolition shall be let only to a licensed contractor. The contract documents shall provide that the value of the materials and other salvage of the property shall be credited against the costs of the demolition. The contract documents may require bidders to estimate the salvage value of the property and, by claiming the salvage, reduce the amount of his bid accordingly. The contract price fixed by acceptance of such a bid shall not be adjusted to reflect the actual salvage value. Such bids may be let prior to the time for compliance or appeal, but shall not be binding or accepted until the order for demolition is final. The director shall have the authority to sign the contract on behalf of the city.

3. There shall be charged against the owner and assessed against the property of any boarded up building an annual inspection fee of $500.00. Such fee shall be payable at the time the building becomes a boarded up building. The hearing examiner or director shall order a refund of the proportional amount not due if the building is reoccupied or demolished. Subsequent annual fees shall be payable on or before the preceding annual fee has been exhausted.

B. Actual costs and expenses will be assessed in accord with the provisions of this section.

C. In addition to actual abatement costs, the following administrative fees shall be assessed and collected in the same manner:

b. Substandard building: $400.00;

c. Unfit building: $600.00;

b. Substandard building: $4,000;

c. Unfit building: $6,000.

4. Where the abatement is accomplished by the city following hearing or default of the property owner:

a. Nuisance, vacant or boarded up structure: $2,000;

b. Substandard building: $4,000;

c. Unfit building: $6,000.

5. For cases heard by the hearing examiner add $1,000.

6. For repeat violations, costs shall be doubled.

7. Vacant and boarded up properties will be assessed $400.00 per month for residential properties and commercial and industrial property shall be assessed one-fifth percent (0.2 percent) of the assessed value of the property per month, or fraction thereof, for each month the property remains vacant or boarded up.

D. The director or hearing examiner may modify the time or methods of payment of such expenses as the condition of the property and the circumstances of the owner may warrant. In setting costs, they may reduce the costs to an owner who has acted in good faith. They may increase costs if it appears that the scheduled costs are inadequate to make the city whole with respect to a particular violation. (Ord. 1928 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1862 § 2 (Exh.

15.20.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

A. “Appeal” means a request for a review of the building inspector’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

B. “Area of flooding” means a designated AI or AH zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AI is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

C. “Area of special flood hazard” is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term “special flood hazard area” is synonymous in meaning with the phrase “area of special flood hazard.”

D. “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

E. “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

F. “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard.

G. “Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

H. “Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

I. “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

J. “Flood elevation” means a determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator of the water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.

K. “Flood insurance rate map” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

L. “Flood insurance study” means the official report provided by the Flood Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood boundary-floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

M. “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

N. “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at MMC 15.20.190(B).

O. “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.

P. “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

Q. “Habitable floor” means any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation or a combination thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a “habitable floor.”

R. “New construction” means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

S. “New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

T. “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle:

1. Built on a single chassis;

2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

U. “Regulatory floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.

V. “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footing, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

W. “Structure” means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. Structure, for insurance purposes, means:

1. A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site;

2. A manufactured home (“a manufactured home,” also known as a mobile home, is a structure: built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or

3. A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community’s floodplain management and building ordinances or laws.

For the latter purpose, “structure” does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in subsection (W)(3) of this section, or a gas or liquid storage tank.

X. “Subsidized rates” mean the rates established by the Federal Insurance Administrator involving in the aggregate a subsidization by the federal government.

Y. “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

Z. “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

2. Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided, that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”

AA. “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

BB. “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 40 CFR 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (Ord. 1913 § 2, 2017; Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).

2. Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

E. Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. The building inspector shall make interpretations, where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual flood conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in MMC 15.20.240 and 15.20.250. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.120 Required.

In all areas of special flood hazards, the standards set out in MMC 15.20.130 through 15.20.170 are required. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.130 Anchoring.

A. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.

B. All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).

(Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.170 Review of building permits.

Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source (see MMC 15.20.110(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to ensure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding.

The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.180 Required.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in MMC 15.20.060 or in 15.20.110(B), the standards set out in MMC 15.20.190 through 15.20.230 are required. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).

3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.200 Nonresidential construction.

New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

A. Be floodproofed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

B. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

C. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this section based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in MMC 15.20.110(C).

D. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in MMC 15.20.190(B).

E. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to one foot above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level). (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.205 Critical facilities.

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the base floodplain. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the base floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the base floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base floodplain shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.210 Manufactured homes.

(Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.215 Recreational vehicles.

Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required to either:

A. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

B. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

C. Meet the requirements of MMC 15.20.210 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. (Ord. Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006).


15.20.220 Floodways designated.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in MMC 15.20.060 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibition of encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

1. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

2. Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

a. Before the repairs, reconstruction, or repair is started; or

b. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places may be excluded in the 50 percent test of subsection (B)(2) of this section.

C. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of MMC 15.20.120 through 15.20.230. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.230 Standards for shallow flooding areas (AO zones).

Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

A. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

B. New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:

1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as in MMC 15.20.200(C).

C. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.240 Hearing board.

A. The hearing examiner shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B. The hearing examiner shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the hearing examiner, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the superior court, as provided in Chapter 7.16 RCW.

D. In passing upon such applications, the hearing examiner shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

11. The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

E. Upon consideration of the factors of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the hearing examiner may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

F. The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1332 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.250 Variances – Conditions.

A. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing MMC 15.20.240(D)(1) through (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

C. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

E. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in MMC 15.20.240(D), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

F. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

G. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection A of this section, and otherwise complies with MMC 15.20.130 and 15.20.140.

H. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.260 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.270 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Milton, any officer, or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).


15.20.280 Violation – Penalty.

Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided in Chapter 1.08 MMC. (Ord. 1670 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1123 § 1, 1990).1

16.04.010 Purpose. 

Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and has been publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. It is therefore in the interest of the public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.015 Exemptions. 

Pursuant to RCW 58.17.040, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to:

A. Cemeteries and other burial plots while used for that purpose;

B. Divisions of land into lots or tracts each of which is one-one hundred twenty-eighth of a section of land or larger, or five acres or larger if the land is not capable of description as a fraction of a section of land; provided, that for purposes of computing the size of any lot under this subsection which borders on a street or road, the lot size shall be expanded to include that area which would be bounded by the center line of the road or street and the side lot lines of the lot running perpendicular to such center line;

C. Divisions made by testamentary provisions or the laws of descent;

D. Divisions of land into lots or tracts classified for industrial or commercial use when the city has approved a binding site plan governed by Chapter 16.30 MMC;

E. A division for the purpose of lease when no residential structure other than mobile homes or travel trailers is permitted to be placed upon the land when the city has approved a binding site plan for the use of the land in accordance with local regulations;

F. A division made for the purpose of alteration by adjusting boundary lines, between platted or unplatted lots, or both, which does not create any additional lot, tract, parcel, site, or division nor create any lot, tract, parcel, site, or division which contains insufficient area and dimension to meet minimum requirements for width and area for a building site; and

G. Divisions of land into lots or tracts if:

1. Such division is the result of subjecting a portion of a parcel or tract of land to either Chapter 64.32 or 64.34 RCW subsequent to the recording of a binding site plan for all such land;

2. The improvements constructed or to be constructed thereon are required by the pro-visions of the binding site plan to be included in one or more condominiums, or owned by an association or other legal entity in which the owners of the units therein, or the owners’ associations have a membership or other legal or beneficial interest;

3. A city has approved the binding site plan for all such land;

4. Such approved binding site plan is recorded in the county or counties in which such land is located; 

5. The binding site plan contains thereon the following statement:

All development and use of the land described herein shall be in accordance with this binding site plan, as it may be amended with the approval of the city having jurisdiction over the development of such land, and in accordance with such other governmental permits, approvals, regulations, requirements, and restrictions that may be imposed upon such land and the development and use thereof. Upon completion, the improvements on the land shall be included in one or more condominiums or owned by an association or other legal entity in which the owners of units therein or their owners’ associations have a membership or other legal or beneficial interest. This binding site plan shall be binding upon all now or hereafter having any interest in the land described herein.

The binding site plan may, but need not, depict or describe the boundaries of the lots or tracts resulting from subjecting a portion of the land to either Chapter 64.32 or 64.34 RCW; 

6. Chapter 17.62 MMC shall govern the review and approval process for binding site plans subject to this exemption;

7. A division for the purpose of leasing land for facilities providing personal wireless services while used for that purpose. “Personal wireless services” means any federally licensed personal wireless service. “Facilities” means unstaffed facilities that are used for the transmission or reception, or both, of wireless communication services including, but not necessarily limited to, antenna arrays, transmission cables, equipment shelters, and support structures; and 

A division of land into lots or tracts of less than three acres that is recorded in accordance with Chapter 58.09 RCW and is used or to be used for the purpose of establishing a site for construction and operation of consumer-owned or investor-owned electric utility facilities. For purposes of this subsection, “electric utility facilities” means unstaffed facilities, except for the presence of security personnel, that are used for or in connection with or to facilitate the transmission, distribution, sale, or furnishing of electricity including, but not limited to, electric power substations. This subsection does not exempt a division of land from the zoning and permitting laws and regulations of cities, towns, counties, and municipal corporations. Furthermore, this subsection only applies to electric utility facilities that will be placed into service to meet the electrical needs of a utility’s existing and new customers. New customers are defined as electric service locations not already in existence as of the date that electric utility facilities subject to the provisions of this subsection are planned and constructed. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.020 Application requirements. 

The applicant must provide application materials as required in Chapter 17.70 MMC (Application Requirements) and any additional information required in the applicable code section for plats (Chapter 16.12 MMC), subdivisions (Chapter 16.12 MMC), binding site plans (Chapter 16.30 MMC), boundary line adjustments (Chapter 16.29 MMC) or short subdivisions (Chapter 16.28 MMC). (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.030 Permit decision and appeal process. 

The review process for MMC Title 16 decisions and appeals is governed by Chapter 17.71 MMC. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.040 General review and approval criteria. 

A. The city shall consider the following review requirements as part of the approval of a preliminary plat, short subdivision (preliminary or final if the applicant only applies for final), boundary line adjustment or binding site plan application: 

1. The review and approval criteria outlined in MMC 17.72.020 (Performance guarantees); 

2. The provisions of the particular type of proposed preliminary plat (Chapter 16.12 MMC), short plat (Chapter 16.28 MMC), boundary line adjustment (Chapter 16.29 MMC) or binding site plan (Chapter 16.30 MMC);

3. The city’s comprehensive plan; and

4. The policies set forth in the state’s Growth Management Act. 

B. For preliminary plats and short subdivisions (preliminary or final if the applicant only applies for final), the decision-maker, before approval is given, shall inquire into the public use and interest proposed to be served by the establishment of a subdivision and dedication. The decision-maker shall determine if appropriate provisions are made for, but not limited to, the public health, safety, and general welfare, for open spaces, drainage ways, streets or roads, alleys, other public ways, transit stops, potable water supplies, sanitary wastes, parks and recreation, playgrounds, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and shall consider all other relevant facts, including sidewalks and other planning features that assure safe walking conditions for students who only walk to and from school; and determine whether the public interest will be served by the subdivision and dedication. Dedication of land, provision of public improvements to serve the subdivision, and/or impact fees may be required as a condition of subdivision approval. If the decision-maker finds that the proposed plat makes appropriate provisions for the public health, safety and general welfare, for open spaces, drainage ways, streets, other public ways, water supplies, sanitary wastes, parks, playgrounds, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and that the public use and interest will be served by the platting of such subdivision, then it shall be approved. If the decision-maker finds that the proposed plat does not make such provisions or that the public use and interest will not be served, then the decision-maker may disapprove the proposed plat. Dedication of land may be required as a condition of subdivision approval and shall be clearly shown on the final plat. The city may not require the procurement of a release from damages from other property owners as a condition of subdivision approval.

C. A proposed subdivision site may be disapproved because of flood, inundation or swamp conditions. Construction of protective improvements may be required as a condition of approval, and such improvements shall be noted on the final plat. 

D. No plat shall be approved covering any land situated in a flood control zone, as provided in Chapter 86.16 RCW, without prior written approval of the Department of Ecology of the State of Washington. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.050 Performance guarantees. 

This section applies to the required performance guarantees for all plat or subdivision decisions. The public works director may prescribe the form of the performance guarantee and establish the amount, format and terms of any required maintenance security.

A. Installation Security. The public works director or the director of planning and community development may require the applicant to enter into a security for the performance of installation of street, utilities or other improvements within the plat and associated work. Installation security is required if the applicant wishes to receive a final plat approval ahead of completion and acceptance of any required work and the public works director determines that the deferral of the improvements will not jeopardize public health, safety or welfare. 

B. Maintenance Security and Agreement. A separate maintenance security guaranteeing the work will be maintained for a specified period and shall be executed prior to or concurrent with the approval of a final plat or final short plat. These securities are applicable to all work and capital improvements including, but not limited to, utilities, public and private streets and storm water facilities. An agreement specifying the type of maintenance and the period of the maintenance is also required.

C. Covenants. To implement any condition of approval requiring ongoing maintenance, the public works director can specify a homeowners’ association or other specific group of landowners implement a covenant or covenants to assure the maintenance of the utility, roads, or other improvement not dedicated to the city to assure maintenance of said facilities. The written covenant(s) shall be submitted in draft form, reviewed by staff, revised if necessary and recorded. The covenant(s) must ensure the development remains in accordance with the proposed design and conditions of project approval. Covenants must bind all future purchasers, tenants and occupants of the proposal and those portions required by the city may not be amended without the consent of the city. The covenants must also provide that the city may conduct any required maintenance or repair at the expense of the homeowners if the homeowners fail to do the required maintenance or repair after reasonable notice from the city. The applicant must record the covenant prior to or concurrent with final permit approval. The maintenance agreement may include as applicable, and without limitation, all of the following provisions: 

1. Open Space Preservation.

a. An adequate guarantee providing for the ownership, permanent preservation, retention and maintenance of all open space and landscaped areas including payment of taxes.

b. An adequate method of assuring the ongoing maintenance of all open spaces and landscaped areas, including structures and appurtenances.

2. Storm Water Facilities. The covenant must provide for the care and maintenance of private storm water facilities.

3. Streets and Driveways. The covenant must provide for the care and maintenance of private streets, access roads and driveways. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.060 Permit revision and modification.

Revisions to an approved subdivision, short subdivision, boundary line adjustment or binding site plan shall follow the procedure as set forth in Chapter 17.74 MMC (Permit Revision and Modification) and RCW 58.17.212, 58.17.215, 58.17.217 and 58.17.218. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.070 Violation – Penalty. 

A. The enforcement of this title and the penalties for the unapproved recordation or transfer of land are provided by state law and Chapters 17.76 through 17.79 MMC; provided, that any state criminal provisions shall supersede any conflicting penalties and procedures in the MMC.

B. Any person, firm, corporation, or association or any agent of any person, firm, corporation or association who violates any provision of this chapter adopted pursuant to state law, relating to the sale, offer for sale, lease or transfer of any lot, tract or parcel of land, or who transfers or sells, or agrees to sell or option any land by reference to, or exhibition of, or by any other use of, a plat or map of a subdivision before it has been approved and filed, shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor, and each sale, offer for sale, lease or transfer of each separate lot, tract, or parcel of land in violation of any provision of this chapter shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. The description of the lot by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer, agreeing or optioning, shall not exempt the transaction from the penalty, nor from the remedies herein provided. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.080 Sale limitations. 

The sale of proposed lots prior to preliminary plat approval is prohibited as specified in RCW 58.17.200 and 58.17.205, as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1741 § 15, 2009).


16.04.090 Recording. 

The document must be certified for filing by the land use administrator. The land use administrator will cause a record of the document to be made with the county auditor of Pierce County or the office of records in King County.

16.12.010 Scope. 

Every subdivision shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and the sections hereof. The subdivision shall consist of greater than four lots or tracts of land which are divided from the original tract. (Ord. 1741 § 16, 2009).


16.12.020 Permit decision and appeal processes. 

The subdivider should consult early and informally with the land use administrator and his/her technical staff for advice and assistance before preparation of a preliminary plat and its formal application for approval. A preapplication conference is recommended. 

The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two steps and an optional third step. The initial step is the preparation and submission of an application for a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. This application shall be decided by the hearing examiner using Process Type IV (Chapter 17.71 MMC). 

The optional step is preparation and submittal of civil engineering drawings for the construction of the plat. This step may be combined with the preliminary plat thus making it optional. The application for civil engineering is decided upon by the public works director. The improvements must be constructed or securities must be established prior to issuance of final plat. 

The final step is the preparation and submission of an application for a final plat. The final plat is decided upon by the hearing examiner as a Process Type II decision (Chapter 17.71 MMC). This final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the county auditor when duly signed by the officials as set forth in this title. 

No plat of a subdivision of land within the city shall be filed or recorded by the auditor of Pierce/King County without the approval of the final plat by the hearing examiner as specified in this title. (Ord. 1741 § 16, 2009).


16.12.040 Access standards for subdivisions. 

A. Future Street Reservations. The public works director may require the applicant to reserve or dedicate right-of-way up to 60 feet in width for any future transportation system improvements as identified in the most recently adopted version of the city of Milton transportation improvement plan. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, the plat shall arrange such parcels to allow for the opening of future streets and further subdivision.

B. Access Required. Each lot in a plat shall have direct access to a public street or shall be served by an access corridor such as a private street, tract, access easement or panhandle having direct access to a public street.

C. Access Requirements.

1. The land use administrator shall review the proposed permit for adequate ingress and egress to all proposed lots. The administrator may require the extension of streets or access rights from the property line to property line of the plat to ensure the feasibility of future extension of streets. 

2. The land use administrator may limit the location of direct access to city arterial or other city streets if there is other reasonable access available. 

3. The public works director will deny any right-of-way dedication not meeting city standards.

4. The face of the recorded plat shall include a notification of any obligation by an adjoining landowner to construct or maintain a future road. 

D. Access Standards. Private streets, access corridors, tracts and panhandles may be approved by the land use administrator, in consultation with the public works director and fire marshal.

1. The minimum width for a panhandle, an access tract or an access corridor serving one or two lots is 20 feet with a minimum pavement width of 14 feet unless the access is needed for a fire lane. If the access is needed for a fire lane, a minimum width of 30 feet with a minimum pavement width of 20 feet is required. The minimum width of an access tract or corridor that serves three or four lots is 30 feet with a minimum pavement width of 20 feet. Parking is prohibited within a panhandle, access tract, access corridor or fire lane.

2. Access corridors up to 150 feet in length do not require a turn-around. Access corridors that are 20 feet wide and greater and less than 500 feet in length shall provide a dedicated turn-around as described in IFC Appendix D Table D103.4. Access corridors that are more than 500 feet in length up to 750 feet in length shall be 30 feet in width, and shall provide a dedicated turn-around as described in IFC Appendix D Table D103.4. Access corridors more than 750 feet in length shall be subject to approval of the fire marshal. The length of the access corridor shall be measured along the center line of the access from the edge of the public right-of-way to the nearest lot line of the most distant lot.

3. The land use administrator may require greater width to address the need for such items as parking, drainage, or emergency access. The administrator may also permit a lesser width for 30-foot-wide access corridors to address constraints such as critical areas or existing parcel boundaries. 

4. When determining if the proposed lot meets the applicable bulk and dimensional regulations set forth in Chapters 17.15A and 17.15B MMC, the land use administrator shall not include the corridor as part of a lot. 

5. Access corridors serving more than two lots shall have official city street designations and addresses. Signage for private streets must indicate the street is private, for example “25th Avenue Court (Private).” The public works director may prescribe the form and placement of street signs. 

6. At least one required minimum lot width must separate two adjacent access corridors or the access portions of two panhandle lots, or any combination of an access corridor and access portion of a panhandle lot.

17.42.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this section is to allow certain specified uses through a special use permit. Special uses are those which are deemed necessary to the public convenience but are found to possess characteristics relating to their size, numbers of people involved, traffic generated, and their potential impact on the area which makes impractical their being identified exclusively with any particular zone classification as herein defined. Because of their special impact or unique characteristics, the following uses may have a substantial adverse impact upon or be incompatible with other uses of land. This impact often cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed for a particular location.

It is the intent of this chapter to ensure that the location of these uses will not be unreasonably incompatible with uses permitted in the surrounding areas, the uses will not have a substantial adverse impact, and to permit the hearing examiner to impose stipulations and conditions as may reasonably assure that the basic intent of this chapter will be served regarding the approval, denial, or approval with conditions for the issuance of a special use permit.

Uses requiring the approval of a special use permit have been divided into Class I and Class II special uses. Review criteria for Class I special uses are found in MMC 17.42.040 and 17.42.050. Review of proposals for Class II special uses shall include the review criteria for Class I special uses and the appropriate criteria found in MMC 17.42.060 for Class II special uses.

The city of Milton’s land use administrator or her/his designee may request a hearing before the hearing examiner if it is determined after review that the special use no longer is being performed under the conditions set by the hearing examiner at the time of the initial approval. During the hearing, the hearing examiner may terminate the use or add conditions or standards that will achieve compliance with the original approval. (Ord. 1912 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1741 § 21, 2009; Ord. 1405 § 2, 1999. Formerly 17.42.080).


Chapter 17.43 DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

Sections:

17.43.010    Purpose.

17.43.020    Review required.

17.43.030    Procedure.

17.43.040    Design guidelines and standards adopted.

17.43.050    Compliance.


17.43.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish the types of developments which shall be subject to design review pursuant to the adopted standards and guidelines. Further, the chapter shall establish the standards and guidelines for the city of Milton, and the procedure to address conflicts between the standards and guidelines and the underlying zoning designation, should such a conflict arise. (Ord. 1912 § 1, 2017; Ord. 1841 § 2, 2014).


17.43.020 Review required.

A. Design Review. All development which falls within the thresholds provided in this section shall be subject to design review as provided for in Chapter 17.71 MMC, Permit Decision and Appeal Processes.

B. Applicability. The following types of development shall be required to conform to the requirements of the uptown district design standards and guidelines, applicable to the type of development activity being undertaken (i.e., new buildings shall be required to comply with the standards and guidelines applicable to new buildings, parking lot standards shall apply to parking lot reconfiguration, etc.):

1. New buildings.

2. Expansion of Building Footprint. The new square footage associated with the building expansion is required to meet the applicable criteria of the uptown design standards and guidelines, except where such expansion is greater than 50 percent of the gross square footage of the building, in which case the entire building shall be brought into compliance with the applicable criteria of the uptown design standards and guidelines.

3. Parking Lot Reconfiguration. The reconfigured portion of the parking lot shall meet the applicable criteria of the uptown design standards and guidelines, except where such expansion is greater than 50 percent of the overall parking lot, at which point the entire parking lot shall be brought into compliance with the applicable criteria of the uptown design standards and guidelines. Actions such as relocation of ADA spaces, overlays, or other minor projects which do not alter the circulation pattern or physical location of the parking stalls are exempt.

4. External facade modification resulting in modification of more than 50 percent of the building facade.

C. Conflicts. In the event of a conflict between the standards and guidelines adopted in MMC 17.43.040(A) and the underlying zoning code, the standards and guidelines shall apply. The standards and guidelines adopted in MMC 17.43.040(A) are not intended to and shall not be construed to modify, alter or supersede any provisions related to allowed or prohibited uses in the underlying zoning code.

D. In the event that a formal code interpretation is requested, the director shall follow the process in Chapter 17.76 MMC, Administration and Enforcement, and Chapter 17.71 MMC, Permit Decision and Appeal Processes.

1. In making the interpretation, the director shall refer to the intent statements in the applicable sections of the standards and guidelines, the overall intent of the standards and guidelines, the goals and policies identified in the comprehensive plan, and the adopted 2012 Vision, in determining the appropriate standard to apply. This is not intended to create a new standard.

2. In case of inconsistency or conflict, regulations, conditions, or procedural requirements that are specific to an individual land use shall supersede regulations, conditions, or procedural requirements of general application.

3. The interpretation shall be in writing and shall include references to all provisions of the city’s adopted codes and regulations referenced or relied upon in making the determination.

4. In addition to the provisions of Chapter 17.76 MMC, the director shall enter findings of facts in substantial similarity to those found in subsections (E)(1) through (E)(5) of this section.

E. Proportional Compliance. Where strict application of a standard or guideline will interfere with the use, existing building, site operations or use, circulation or access, or site ownership, the applicant may request a proportional compliance decision. A proportional compliance decision determines the extent to which a redevelopment project needs to meet the design standards and guidelines. It is intended to assure, for example, that a parking lot modification does not trigger the requirement for facade compliance with the design standards and guidelines; that a building modification that does not alter the parking or circulation patterns does not trigger parking and circulation compliance, etc. In requesting a proportional compliance decision, the applicant shall submit to the director a written request that addresses required findings (1) through (4) below. In making a decision on the request, the director shall follow the process for code interpretations in Chapter 17.76 MMC, Administration and Enforcement, and Chapter 17.71 MMC, Permit Decision and Appeal Processes, and enter findings of fact to support the proportional compliance decision.

c. For all newly planted areas, three cubic yards of composted organic matter per 1,000 square feet of landscape area should be added to a depth of four inches to the top of the soil.

d. Seeded areas shall be fine graded and rolled.

2. Mulching of Newly Planted or Replanted Areas.

a. Mulches must be applied to the following depths: a minimum three inches over bare soil, and two inches where plant materials will cover.

b. Mulches must include organic materials, such as wood chips and shredded bark.

c. Nonporous materials, such as plastic sheeting, shall not be used in any area of the landscape because of down-slope erosion and potential soil contamination from herbicide washing.

d. Mulch should be applied regularly to and maintained in all planting areas to assist soils in retaining moisture, reducing weed growth, and minimizing erosion.

J. Water Retention, Conservation and Low Impact Design. Refer to subsection (F)(3) of this section for guidance.

1. Low Impact Planting Design and Technology. The following low impact design standards are provided to assist the applicant in the reduction of maintenance costs associated with development, to enhance the health and vitality of plant material, and to reduce watering costs, thus conserving water resources:

Guideline a. Utilize two-track surfaces with grass or vegetation in between to provide water infiltration for roads, driveways, parking lots and other types of drivable or walkable surfaces.

Guideline b. Design parking lot landscaping to function as part of the development’s storm water management system utilizing vegetated islands with bioretention functions.

Guideline c. Incorporate existing natural drainage ways and vegetated channels, rather than the standard concrete curb and gutter configuration to decrease flow velocity and allow for storm water infiltration.

Guideline d. Divert water from downspouts away from driveway surfaces and into bioretention areas or rain gardens to capture, store, and infiltrate storm water on site.

Guideline e. Encourage construction of vegetative low impact design storm water controls (bioretention, swales, filter strips, buffers) on land held in common.

Guideline f. Walkable surfaces and hardscapes should be designed with unit pavers in sand or pervious paving.

2. Water Retention and Low Impact Design. This method allows use of landscape area to also handle the runoff treatment for the project, if possible.

Guideline g. Create vegetated depressions, commonly known as bioretention areas or rain gardens, that collect runoff and allow for short-term ponding and slow infiltration. Rain gardens consist of relatively small depressed or bowl shaped planting beds that treat runoff from storms of one inch or less. Rain gardens should be used for on-site retention and treatment of runoff instead of or in addition to constructed pipe or vault storage.

Guideline h. Locate dry wells consisting of gravel or stone-filled pits to catch water from roof downspouts or paved areas.

Guideline i – Detention and Infiltration. In parking areas, landscaped islands can be used for first runoff retention, treatment and conveyance to a detention area.

Guideline j. Landscape material should be chosen for bioretention areas for their water tolerance separately from other landscaped areas which will not be inundated on a regular basis.

3. Water Conservation. To take advantage of natural rainfall in order to reduce the amount of water that is required to maintain healthy plant material during the dry season to increase deep water penetration and soil oxygenation.

Guideline k – Compatible Materials. Trees and plant species should be selected based on having similar climatic, water, soil, and maintenance requirements. Plants should be selected and grouped as determined by natural site conditions and be coordinated with the irrigation plan.

Guideline l – Native Plant Material. Preference shall be given to plants in landscape designs that are native to the Pacific Northwest or are introduced plants that are common to the Pacific Northwest in order to better reflect and complement the natural surroundings and natural pattern of rainfall and drought conditions.

Guideline m – Ornamental Species. Ornamental species shall be drought-tolerant plants and should be incorporated into designs in order to reduce irrigation requirements unless situated in a water retention or low impact landscape area.

K. Irrigation.

1. Irrigation to take advantage of natural watering in order to reduce the amount of water that is required to maintain healthy plant material during the dry season.

a. Trees and plant species should be selected based on having similar climatic, water, soil, and maintenance requirements.

b. Plants should be selected and grouped as determined by natural site conditions and be coordinated with the irrigation plan.

c. Artificial irrigation shall be provided to commercial, multifamily and industrial (M-1, MX, B, RM, and PD) required plantings.

L. Right-of-Way Landscaping.

1. Planting strips are dictated in the Public Works Guidelines and Development Standards. Whether such strips are required or not, trees and landscaping within the right-of-way to the edge of the right-of-way shall be required.

2. Maintenance responsibilities are the abutting property owner’s unless the city of Milton has taken maintenance responsibility in ordinance or resolution form.

3. Spacing. Trees shall be planted approximately every 30 feet, with adjustments made for driveways and utilities.

4. Species and Height. Milton still has areas of overhead wiring. To recognize this fact, two lists of trees have been developed to pick from depending on the existence of the overhead wiring.

5. Species and Location. Street trees shall be planted according to the following chart. Areas not listed do not require trees to be planted.

6. Root Control. A root barrier shall be installed to prevent roots from damaging pavement. The root control barrier should be constructed of galvanized metal or plastic sheets and should be placed a minimum of two feet below the finished grade. The applicant may choose to use a method of root control besides galvanized metal or plastic sheets, provided they can prove the proposed product is similar in quality, strength, and ability to block roots as galvanized metal or plastic sheets.

7. Residential subdivisions, multifamily development, commercial, industrial or institutional developments shall require street frontage landscaping including requirements for street trees.

B. A legal nonconforming sign must be brought into compliance with this chapter or removed if:

If the owner cannot be found or refuses to comply with the order to remove, the building official may then have the dangerous sign removed and the owner cited. The cost of removing the sign plus administrative costs will be charged to the property owner.

B. Any person who owns or leases a nonconforming sign must remove the sign when it has been abandoned.

C. If the permittee has not identified himself, the city may remove any sign once it has ceased to be relevant, if it should be removed under this section or if the city might have requested the permittee remove it. (Ord. 1938 § 1, 2018; Ord. 1666 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1663 § 20, 2006; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2000).


17.50.180 Deviation from standards.

A. Authority. The land use administrator may grant a deviation from the requirements of this chapter using Process II (Chapter 17.71 MMC). In granting any deviation, the director may prescribe conditions that are necessary to satisfy the criteria below.

B. Nonconforming Signs. The land use administrator may grant a deviation from standards from the provisions of MMC 17.50.150(B)(4) requiring the removal of a nonconforming sign because of a change in copy only if the circumstances prompting the deviation from standards request do not result from the actions of the applicant. A change in telephone area code or street name are two examples of potential changes in copy that would not be prompted by the actions of the applicant.

C. Standards. The land use administrator may grant a deviation from standards of this chapter only if the applicant demonstrates compliance with the following criteria:

1. The deviation from standards as approved does not constitute a grant that is inconsistent with the intent of the sign code;

2. The deviation from standards is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located;

3. The granting of the deviation from standards will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located;

4. The special conditions and circumstances prompting the deviation from standards request do not result from the actions of the applicant;

5. The deviation from standards as granted represents the least amount of deviation from the prescribed regulations necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the deviation from standards is sought and that is consistent with the stated intent of this chapter; and

6. The granting of the deviation from standards will not constitute a public nuisance or adversely affect the public safety and the proposed deviation from standards does not interfere with the location and identification of adjacent buildings or activities.

D. Other Considerations. The land use administrator will grant deviations that are necessary to comply with MMC 17.50.182. The administrator will also consider deviations necessary to harmonize a sign with any associated structures of a recognized architectural style whether new construction or an existing structure. (Ord. 1938 § 1, 2018; Ord. 1741 § 23, 2009; Ord. 1666 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2000).


17.50.182 Construction.

A. Not Content-Based. The city recognizes that content-based laws target speech based on its communicative content, they are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests. Except where a compelling state interest is involved such as the control of public safety matters, this chapter does not in any way deal with the content of signs other than as expressly stated.

B. Narrowly Construed. This chapter shall be narrowly construed to impose the least impingement on free speech and expression as is consistent with the exercise of the police power of the city.

C. No Criminal Activity Permitted. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as permitting the public display of illegal pornography, or the solicitation for the commission of crimes or treason. (Ord. 1938 § 1, 2018).


17.50.185 Signs of historical community significance.

A. A sign may be designated by the city council as a sign of historical community significance.

B. When a sign of historical community significance is reestablished after a period of absence, the sign must be restored to its historic appearance, height, and width to be classified as historically significant. If the sign is altered, including but not limited to additional messaging that was not historically present, the sign will not be considered historically significant. (Ord. 1938 § 1, 2018).


17.50.190 Penalty for violations.

A. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, alter, move, improve, convert, demolish, equip, or use any sign or sign structure in the city, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary or in violation of any provisions of this chapter.

B. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable as set forth in MMC 9.04.040. (Ord. 1938 § 1, 2018; Ord. 1666 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1536 § 2, 2002; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2000).


17.50.200 Severability.

If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such order or judgment shall be confined in its operation to the controversy in which it was rendered and shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any part thereof to any other person or circumstances and to this end the provisions of each clause, sentence, paragraph, section or part of this law are hereby declared to be severable. (Ord. 1938 § 1, 2018; Ord. 1666 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2000).

The property owner shall have the burden of proof in establishing that a use or structure is legally nonconforming and shall present all evidence in support of legal nonconforming use in document form as part of the request. (Ord. 1741 § 24, 2009).


17.52.020 Continuing existing uses.

Any lawful use of land and/or building or structure existing or under construction, or for which a building or use permit has been granted, and is still in force at the time this code becomes effective, may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of the zone in which it is located, subject to the provisions of this chapter.

17.52.030 Alterations and enlargements.

A. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout an existing building or structure.

B. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this code, nonconforming buildings may not be enlarged or structurally altered, unless the enlargement or structural alteration makes the building more conforming or is required by law. However, where a building or buildings and customary accessory buildings are nonconforming only by reason of substandard yards or open spaces, the provisions of this code prohibiting structural alterations or enlargements of an existing building shall not apply; provided such alterations or enlargements do not increase the degree of nonconformity of yards or open spaces. Any enlargements or new buildings and structures shall observe the yard and open spaces required on the lot by this code.

C. Structural alterations or enlargements may be permitted if necessary to adapt a nonconforming building or buildings to new technologies, or equipment pertaining to the uses housed in the building or buildings, or to improve the appearance, functionality, or safety of the building or buildings, in a manner which will bring them into greater conformity with the surrounding area. The alterations or enlargements shall be authorized only by a variance processed in the manner prescribed by this code.

D. Normal upkeep, repair, and maintenance of nonconforming buildings is permitted; provided such activities shall not increase the nonconformity of the building or buildings.

E. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor shall any such nonconforming use be extended to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time this code becomes effective, nor shall any such nonconforming use be moved, in whole or in part, to any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by the nonconforming use at the time of the adoption of this code. (Ord. 1405 § 2, 1999).

Any nonconforming building or structure which has been damaged by fire, earthquake, flood, wind, or other disaster to not more than 75 percent of its value at the time of its destruction may be rebuilt for the same nonconforming use only, but the restoring of any such nonconforming building shall not serve to extend or increase the nonconformance of the original building or use. (Ord. 1405 § 2, 1999).


17.52.050 Abandonment.

If any nonconforming use of land and/or building or structure is abandoned and/or ceases for any reason whatsoever, including destruction of the building, for a period of one year or more, any future use of such land and/or building or structure shall be in conformity to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located, as specified by this code. (Ord. 1405 § 2, 1999).


17.52.060 Change of use.

Any nonconforming use of land and/or buildings or structures shall not be changed to any other use, unless the proposed use is one that is permitted in the zoning district in which the nonconforming use is located. If a new use is desired, which is no less conforming than the existing use, a variance may be obtained before the requested use can commence. (Ord. 1405 § 2, 1999).

5. Director’s Decision.

a. Purpose. The community development director shall review the proposal to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable law, to ensure that the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city are preserved, and to provide an expedient and reasonable land use review process for decisions and interpretations of this chapter.

b. Director Authority. The director may modify the submittal requirements as deemed appropriate to achieve the purpose stated above.

In addition, because each homeless encampment has unique characteristics, including but not limited to size, duration, uses, number of occupants and composition, the director shall have the authority to impose conditions to the issuance of the permit for homeless encampments to mitigate effects on the community upon finding that said effects are materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity. Conditions, if imposed, must relate to findings by the director, and must be calculated to minimize nuisance generating features in matters of noise, waste, air quality, unsightliness, traffic, physical hazards and other similar matters that the homeless encampment may have on the area in which it is located. 

The community development director may also approve an application for homeless encampment permits with proposed standards and conditions that differ slightly from those in this section only where the applicant submits a description of the standard or condition to be modified and demonstrates how the modification would result in a safe homeless encampment for its residents, and mitigate impacts to neighbors and the community under the specific circumstances of the application.

In all other cases where the application for homeless encampment does not meet the requirements and standards of this section or adequate mitigation may not be feasible or possible, the director shall deny issuance of a homeless encampment permit.

c. Notice of Decision. The director shall notify the sponsoring and host agencies of his or her decision to approve, modify or deny the application within a timely manner, but not prior to 14 days after the neighborhood informational meeting. This decision is a final decision of the city. Notwithstanding the fact that Process Type II for other applications may provide for an appeal of the director’s decision to the hearing examiner, any appeal of the director’s decisions to approve or deny a temporary homeless encampment permit shall be to county superior court.

6. Termination. If the host agency or sponsoring agency fails to take adequately reasonable action against a resident who violates the terms and conditions of this permit to prevent the same in the future, it may result in immediate termination of the permit. If the city learns of illegal activities or acts of violence by residents of the encampment, and the host agency or sponsoring agency has not reasonably addressed the situation, the temporary use permit may be immediately terminated in order to insure public safety, health and welfare. Notice of said termination shall be hand delivered to the applicant. 

7. Revocation. Upon determination that there has been a violation of any approval criteria or condition of application, the director of planning and community development or their designee may give written notice to the permit holder describing the alleged violation. Within 14 days of the mailing of notice of violation, the permit holder shall show cause why the permit should not be revoked. At the end of the 14-day period, the director of planning and community development or their designee shall sustain or revoke the permit. When a temporary homeless encampment permit is revoked, the director of planning and community development or their designee shall notify the permit holder by certified mail of the revocation and the findings upon which revocation is based. Appeals of decisions to revoke a temporary homeless encampment permit shall be to county superior court.

8. Violation. Violations of this section are punishable under Chapter 17.76 MMC and as otherwise provided by law, and are subject to criminal prosecution, injunctive and other forms of relief which the city may seek.

9. No Intent to Create Protected/Benefited Class. This section is intended to promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public. Nothing contained in this section is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or otherwise establish any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the provisions in this section. This section is not intended to be, nor shall be, construed to create any basis for liability on the part of the city, its officials, officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage that an individual, class or group may claim arises from any action or inaction on the part of the city, its officials, officers, employees or agents. Nothing contained in this section is intended to, nor shall be construed to, impose upon the city any duty that can become the basis of a legal action for injury or damage.

The following requirements and performance standards shall apply to any wireless communication structure or facility:

A. Facility Preference. Proposed antenna(s), associated structures and placement shall be evaluated, based on available aesthetic and transmission technologies, for approval and use in the following order of preference:

1. Stealth antenna(s);

2. Antenna(s) attached to a nonresidential structure, only when subsection (A)(1) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished;

3. Co-location on existing facilities, only when subsections (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished;

4. Co-location on new freestanding facilities which extend more than 15 feet above the height limitation of the site’s zoning district, only when subsections (A)(1) through (A)(3) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished.

5. Freestanding facilities which extend no more than 15 feet above the height limitation of the site’s zoning district, only when subsections (A)(1), (A)(2), and (A)(3) of this section cannot be reasonably accomplished. The application shall include the following information:

a. The applicant shall provide proof of inability to locate on existing tower facilities in the immediate vicinity due to the following:

i. Refusal of the tower owner to provide space at a fair rate of compensation;

ii. The existing tower location or configuration is incompatible with the applicant’s system; or

iii. Property owner refusal.

If the applicant chooses to construct new freestanding facilities, monopoles shall be the only freestanding structures allowed in the city. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that a facility of higher order of preference cannot be reasonably accommodated on the same or other properties. The city reserves the right to retain a qualified consultant, at the applicant’s expense, to review the supporting documentation for content and accuracy.

B. Co-Location. Shared use of support structures and other associated facilities by multiple parties is encouraged. Co-location WCFs shall be permitted to exceed the height limitations for freestanding transmission facilities. In no case, however, shall more than two service providers be permitted to co-locate on a single WCF. Prior to city approval of any new freestanding transmission tower:

1. An application for a new freestanding, co-location WCF requires two service providers to be party to the application;

2. A new freestanding, co-location WCF shall be permitted to exceed the height limits for new freestanding WCF facilities by 15 feet to allow adequate separation between service providers;

3. The city shall forward all new freestanding, co-location WCF applications to a qualified consultant to review the proposal for accuracy;

4. As a condition of city approval of any new freestanding co-location transmission towers, the applicant shall ensure the availability of adequate space to accommodate associated equipment shelters/cabinets of both service providers party to the application.

C. Critical Areas. No antenna shall be located in a critical area or associated buffer required by the city’s critical areas ordinance except through a variance granted by the hearing examiner.

D. Height. Height is measured from the top of the antenna(s). No freestanding WCF for a single service provider shall be approved that is taller than 15 feet above the height limitation of the underlying zoning district. New freestanding co-location WCFs shall be permitted to exceed the height limitation of single service WCFs by a maximum of 15 feet. Freestanding stealth antenna(s) shall have no height limitation (see Figure A at the end of this chapter).

E. Setbacks. A freestanding WCF, including support structure and associated equipment, shall maintain a 30-foot setback from property line(s); except when on a lot adjacent to a residentially zoned property, then the minimum setback from the property line(s) of the adjacent residentially zoned property shall be 60 feet (see Figure C at the end of this chapter).

F. State and Federal Preemption. Federal law prohibits consideration of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that the proposed facilities comply with the Federal Communications Commission regulations concerning emissions. All other city regulations shall apply, unless specifically preempted by state or federal authority.

G. Impacts. Wireless communication facilities shall be located and installed in such a manner so as to minimize impacts on the skyline and surrounding area in the following manner:

1. Antenna(s) may not extend more than 15 feet above their supporting structure, monopole, building, or other structure.

2. Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings, land use, and the zone district to the extent possible, while maintaining the function of the communications equipment. Wireless communication facilities shall be integrated through location, siting, and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site through application of the following measures:

a. Existing on-site vegetation should be preserved insofar as possible or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area;

b. To the extent practicable, and in order to minimize impacts on the skyline and surrounding area, WCFs should be located adjacent to existing vegetation and buildings.

3. Related equipment facilities used to house wireless communications equipment shall be located within buildings, or planned underground when possible. When they cannot be located in buildings or placed underground, equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened. Alternate methods for screening may include the use of building or parapet walls, sight-obscuring fencing and/or berms, landscaping, screen walls, equipment enclosures, or any combination of the above.

4. No wireless equipment shall be used for the purpose of mounting signs or message displays of any kind.

5. WCFs shall not be lighted, except for emergency work lights, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority.

6. WCFs shall conform to the city’s noise regulations. (Ord. 1383 § 1, 1998).


17.58.070 Facility removal.

In instances where a WCF is to be removed, the removal shall be in accordance with the following procedures:

A. The operator of a WCF shall notify the city upon the discontinued use of a particular facility. The WCF shall be removed by the facility owner within 180 days of the date the site’s use is discontinued, it ceases to be operational, the permit is revoked, or if the facility falls into disrepair or is abandoned. Disrepair includes structural features, paint, landscaping, or general lack of maintenance which could result in safety or visual impacts; and

B. If the provider fails to remove the facility upon 180 days of its discontinued use, the responsibility for removal falls upon the landholder on which the facility has been located. If the landholder fails to remove the facility within 90 additional days, the city may cause the facility to be removed at the owner’s expense. (Ord. 1383 § 1, 1998).


17.58.080 Electromagnetic field (EMF) standards compliance.

All WCFs shall be operated in compliance with the following standards:

A. The applicant shall comply with federal standards for EMF emissions. Individuals may request that a service provider perform an EMF emissions test. The cost for conducting such tests, however, shall be borne by the individual requesting the test. Copies of performance reports prepared and transmitted to the FCC for licensing compliance shall be forwarded to the city for inclusion in the project file.

B. The applicant shall ensure that the WCF will not cause localized interference with the reception of, but not limited to, area television or radio broadcasts. If, on review of a registered complaint, the city finds that the WCF interferes with such reception, the city may revoke or modify the permit. The applicant shall be given a reasonable time based on the nature of the problem to correct the interference. If the permit is revoked, then the facility shall be removed per MMC 17.58.070. (Ord. 1383 § 1, 1998).

17.65.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process for reviewing and approving variances from the requirements of this title, Zoning, except for Chapter 17.14 MMC, Table of Uses, and procedural requirements. (Ord. 1761 § 1, 2010; Ord. 1741 § 34, 2009).


17.65.020 Application requirements.

The hearing examiner shall have the authority to grant a variance from the bulk and dimensional provisions of this title, Zoning, when the variance is consistent with the general purpose and intent of this zoning code and all the following conditions have been found to exist: 

A. That there are special circumstances applicable to the subject property, or to the intended use, such as shape, topography, location, or surroundings, that do not apply generally to the other property or class of use in the same vicinity and zone. Special circumstances should not be predicated upon any factor personal to the owners or the ability to make more profitable use of the property.

B. That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use, possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zone, but when because of special circumstances is denied to the property in question. 

C. That the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located. 

D. That the granting of the variance is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 

E. No variances to use standards are allowed. Variances shall be limited to bulk and dimensional standards.

A. The hearing examiner shall decide on applications for reasonable use exceptions in accordance with Process Type IV of Chapter 17.71 MMC. In addition to the procedures identified in Chapter 17.71 MMC under a Process Type IV, a neighborhood meeting shall be held prior to approval. When strict or literal application of this title denies all reasonable economic use to the property and a variance would not provide sufficient relief, the hearing examiner, after conducting a hearing, shall have the authority to issue an exception from said regulation when the following conditions have been found to exist:

1. The application of this title would deny all reasonable use of the property; 

2. There is no other reasonable use which would result in less adverse significant environmental impacts;

3. The proposed development does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety or welfare on or off the development proposal site and is consistent with the general purposes of this title and the public interest, and does not conflict with the Endangered Species Act or other relevant state or federal laws; and 

4. Any waivers of this title’s regulations shall be the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property. 

5. Regulatory waivers under this reasonable use exception shall be limited to bulk and dimensional requirements. If the only way to comply with these reasonable use criteria is by modification to use restrictions, the examiner shall note this in his or her decision and the applicant may then apply for a rezone to seek relief; provided, that nothing in this section shall be construed as altering the requirements for qualifying for a rezone. 

B. Any authorized waivers of development regulations under this section shall be subject to conditions established by the examiner including, but not limited to, mitigation in an approved mitigation plan. (Ord. 1761 § 3, 2010).


17.65.050 Conditions authorized. 

When granting a variance, the hearing examiner shall have the power to attach specific conditions to the variance as necessary to satisfy the criteria for approval. (Ord. 1741 § 34, 2009).

17.65.080 Permit revisions and modifications.

D. “Charging levels” means the standardized indicators of electrical force, or voltage, at which an electric vehicle’s battery is recharged. The terms 1, 2, and 3 are the most common EV charging levels, and include the following specifications:

1. Level 1 is considered slow charging. This requires a 15- or 20-amp breaker on a 120-volt AC circuit and standard outlet. Level 1 charging stations can fully charge a BEV between eight and 32 hours and a PHEV between three and 15 hours.

2. Level 2 is considered medium charging. This requires 40- to 100-amp breaker on a 240-volt AC circuit. A Level 2 charging station can fully charge a BEV between four and six hours and a PHEV between one and two hours.

3. Level 3 is considered fast or rapid charging. This requires a 60-amp or higher dedicated breaker on a 480-volt or higher three-phase circuit with special grounding equipment. Level 3 charging uses an off-board charger to provide the AC to DC conversion, delivering DC directly to the car battery. Charging times range from 25 to 40 minutes for BEVs and less than 20 minutes for PHEVs.

E. “Electric vehicle” means any vehicle that operates, either partially or exclusively, on electrical energy from the grid, or an offboard source, that is stored on board for motive purpose. “Electric vehicle” includes: (1) a battery electric vehicle; (2) a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle; (3) a neighborhood electric vehicle; and (4) a medium-speed electric vehicle.

F. “Electric vehicle charging station” means a public or private parking space that is served by battery charging station equipment that has as its primary purpose the transfer of electric energy (by conductive or inductive means) to a battery or other energy storage device in an electric vehicle. An electric vehicle charging station equipped with Level 1 or Level 2 charging equipment is permitted outright as an accessory use to any principal use.

G. “Electric vehicle infrastructure” means structures, machinery, and equipment necessary and integral to support an electric vehicle, including battery charging stations, rapid charging stations, and battery exchange stations.

H. “Electric vehicle parking space” means any marked parking space that identifies the use to be exclusively for the parking of an electric vehicle.

I. “Medium-speed electric vehicle” means a self-propelled, electrically powered fourwheeled motor vehicle, equipped with a roll cage or crush-proof body design, whose speed attainable in one mile is more than 25 miles per hour but not more than 35 miles per hour and otherwise meets or exceeds the federal regulations set forth in 49 CFR 571.500.

J. “Neighborhood electric vehicle” means a self-propelled, electrically powered fourwheeled motor vehicle whose speed attainable in one mile is more than 20 miles per hour and not more than 25 miles per hour and conforms to federal regulations under 49 CFR 571.500.

K. “Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)” means an electric vehicle that (1) contains an internal combustion engine and also allows power to be delivered to drive wheels by an electric motor; (2) charges its battery primarily by connecting to the grid or other offboard electrical source; (3) may additionally be able to sustain battery charge using an on-board internal-combustion-driven generator; and (4) has the ability to travel powered by electricity.

L. “Rapid charging station” means an industrial grade electrical outlet that allows for faster recharging of electric vehicle batteries through higher power levels and that meets or exceeds any standards, codes, and regulations set forth by Chapter 19.28 RCW and consistent with rules adopted under RCW 19.27.540.

17.71.060 General – Consolidated review.

The applicant may elect to have all permits, except Process I permits and final subdivisions, for a project considered concurrently. The review process for land use permits for the same site with different process types will follow the higher process decision type. (Ord. 1741 § 38, 2009).


17.71.070 General – Preapplication meeting requirement.

The preapplication meeting is a meeting scheduled by the applicable director with a potential applicant for a land use permit to discuss the application submittal requirements and pertinent fees. A preapplication meeting is recommended for Process Type IV, V and VI permits and suggested for Process Type III permits. Other attendees to the preapplication meeting might include representatives from the city electric and water utilities, the storm water compliance officer and any applicable director. A preapplication meeting does not vest the project to the requirement identified at the preapplication meeting. (Ord. 1761 § 5, 2010; Ord. 1741 § 38, 2009).


17.71.090 General – Neighborhood public meeting requirements. 

Where required or elected in the process type a neighborhood public meeting shall be conducted. The applicable director shall schedule public meetings as early in the review process as possible. The applicable director shall publish notice of the public meeting in the same manner as the notice of the public hearing. The applicable director will combine the public meeting notice and the notice of application whenever possible. (Ord. 1741 § 38, 2009).


17.71.100 General – City procedure – Timelines.

A. A final decision on Process Type I and II should be issued within 120 days of the filing of a complete application.

B. Process Types III through V and site specific rezone decisions, critical area decisions (Chapter 18.15 MMC) and boundary line adjustments (Chapter 16.29 MMC) must be issued within 120 days of the issuance of a notice of complete application, as governed by MMC 17.71.110(A); provided, that subdivisions and short subdivisions (including final subdivisions and short subdivisions) shall be subject to the deadlines imposed by Chapter 58.17 RCW, to the extent required by state law.

C. Clock Operation.

1. Start Date. The 120-day clock shall start upon the issuance of a notice of complete application for projects governed by subsection B of this section and upon the filing of a complete application for projects governed by subsection A of this section and will be suspended whenever a letter requesting revisions or information is issued. 

2. A project clock shall restart upon application revisions being submitted to the city through its permits counter. These revisions must be submitted for all of the items of requested revision or information in the letter. If such a letter is issued by the city and a partial revision is submitted by the applicant, the clock shall not restart.

3. The number of revision cycles affects the time spent on a project. The city assumes that projects will take no more than two revision cycles. The limitation of the 120-day clock is intended to be supportive of those applicants who are striving in good faith to meet city requirements. The 120-day clock limit will be extended by 40 days for each cycle of revision for any application which exceeds two cycles of revisions. 

4. End Date. The 120-day clock is intended to measure the time spent by the city from the start date to approval date. The approval date is inclusive of any approval hearings conducted by the city, but appeals are not included. 

5. To the extent allowed by RCW 36.70B.080(1), the city may extend the 120-day clock for specific applications by making written findings that a specified amount of additional time is necessary. 

6. The city council finds that more than 120 days is necessary to review master plan applications due to their high complexity, large scale and intensive impacts. For these reasons, master plan applications involving more than 30 acres shall be subject to a 180-day review period instead of 120 days. 

D. Inactive Applications. If an applicant fails to submit information identified in the notice of incomplete application or subsequent revision requests within 120 days from the applicable director’s mailing date, the application shall be deemed withdrawn. Once an application is withdrawn, the applicable director may require a new application and/or fees to reactivate the file. The applicable director may grant extensions to the withdrawal deadline if a written request demonstrating good cause is filed with the applicable director prior to the withdrawal date. (Ord. 1741 § 38, 2009).


17.71.110 General – Computation of 120-day clock.

A. Notice of Complete or Incomplete Application. The following applies to all Process Types III through V applications, boundary line adjustments (Chapter 16.29 MMC), site specific rezones and critical areas decisions (Chapter 18.16 MMC):

A. Intent. Pursuant to the State Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, after the adoption of its comprehensive plan, the city of Milton is required to ensure that applicable public improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are made concurrent with the development. The intent of this chapter is to establish a concurrency management system to ensure that transportation facilities and services needed to maintain minimum level of service standards are available simultaneous to, or within a reasonable time after, development occupancy or use.

B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter:

1. To ensure adequate levels of service on transportation facilities for existing land uses as well as new development;

2. To provide transportation facilities that achieve and maintain the city’s level of service standards as established in the comprehensive plan; and

3. To ensure that the city’s level of service standards are achieved concurrently with development as required by the Growth Management Act. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).

Z. “Transportation system management” means increasing the efficiency of the existing street system by modifying travel behavior, such as by providing incentives for travel by multi-occupancy vehicles or by shifting travel demand away from the peak hour. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.030 Concurrency applicability and procedures.

A. Applicability. Except for the exemptions provided for in MMC 17.75.090, the test for concurrency will be conducted as a part of all preliminary development permits. Final development permits which did not have a preceding preliminary development permit shall also be subject to the concurrency test, unless exempted by MMC 17.75.090.

B. Procedures. The concurrency test will be performed in the processing of the development permit and conducted by the community development and public works departments.

1. The community development department shall provide the overall coordination of the concurrency test by notifying the service providers of all applications requiring a concurrency test; notifying the service providers of all exempted applications which use capacity; notifying the applicant of the test results; notifying the service providers of the final outcome (approval or denial) of the development permit; and notifying the service providers of any expired development permits, discontinued findings of capacity, or other action resulting in an applicant no longer needing capacity which has been reserved.

2. All service providers shall be responsible for maintaining and monitoring their available and planned capacity by conducting the concurrency test for their individual facility for all applications requiring a concurrency test; reserving the capacity needed for each application; accounting for the capacity for each exempted application which uses capacity; notifying the community development department of the results of the tests; and reinstating any capacity for an expired development permit, discontinued findings of capacity, or other action resulting in an applicant no longer needing capacity which has been reserved. The service providers shall also be responsible for reporting the capacity of their facility to the city of Milton annually. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.040 Concurrency level of service adopted and test.

A. The level of service standards established in the city of Milton comprehensive plan are hereby adopted for the purposes of this chapter.

B. For transportation facilities, available and planned capacity will be used in conducting the concurrency test.

C. If the capacity of transportation facilities is equal to or greater than the capacity required to maintain the level of service standard for the impact from the development permit, then the concurrency test is passed.

D. Development permits that result in a reduction of a level of service below the minimum level of service standard as identified in the city of Milton comprehensive plan fail the concurrency test. In such cases, development shall not be approved unless the development is mitigated pursuant to MMC 17.75.050.

E. In conducting the concurrency test, the city will use the trip generation rates set forth in the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Information Report – Trip Generation. The presumption is that the rates used by the city are accurate unless proven otherwise. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.050 Mitigation options.

If the concurrency test is not passed, the applicant may implement one or more of the following:

A. Modify the application to reduce the need for transportation facilities. This may include inclusion of a transportation system management plan.

B. Arrange with the service provider to provide the additional capacity of transportation facilities required to maintain adopted level of service standards. The improvements necessary to provide available capacity shall be determined by the public works director. If this method is used, the public works director shall insure completion by not issuing any occupancy permit until required traffic lanes are complete or by requiring a bond or other security instrument acceptable to the city to insure that the improvement is completed within six years of development.

C. Form a local improvement district created to assess the benefitting property owners for their fair share of the costs for the needed transportation improvement.

D. Phase or alter the development such that the development’s impact on transportation facilities does not result in the level of service falling below the adopted level of service.

E. Postpone the development until the city can provide the necessary transportation capacity.

F. Request formal reconsideration of the concurrency test to the public works director in accordance with the provisions of MMC 17.75.080. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.060 Finding of concurrency.

A. The finding of concurrency shall be valid for the same time period as the underlying development permit, including any extensions thereof and shall expire if the underlying development permit expires or is revoked by the city.

B. A finding of concurrency shall be valid even if the ownership of the property changes.

C. A finding of concurrency shall only apply to the specific land uses, densities, intensities and development project described in the application and the development permit and is not transferable to other land. The applicant shall describe the proposed development in a manner adequate for the city to determine the peak-hour traffic to be generated by the proposed development.

D. A finding of concurrency for a development permit that requires one or more transportation facilities to be provided by the applicant shall be conditioned upon an appropriate financial commitment by the applicant which is binding upon subsequent owners, heirs, executors, successors or assigns, and upon the completion of such transportation facilities in a timely manner, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or prior to occupancy, unless stated otherwise in writing by the city. Such financial commitment shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney, including performance bond, escrowed funds, or other similar instrument.

E. Revisions to the proposed development that may create additional impacts on transportation facilities will be required to undergo an additional concurrency test.

F. The city may adjust the trip generation forecast of the proposed development in order to account for any transportation strategies proposed by the applicant that are acceptable to the city. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.070 Preliminary concurrency test – Fees.

An applicant may request a preliminary concurrency test without an accompanying request for a development permit. A fee, as set forth in the approved fee schedule, will be charged for such preliminary concurrency test. Any available capacity cannot be reserved. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.080 Concurrency test – Alternative calculation – Fees.

The applicant may submit a calculation of alternative trip generation rates for the proposed development. The city shall review the alternate calculations and indicate in writing whether such calculations are acceptable in lieu of the standard trip generation rates.

If the applicant requests an alternative calculation for the concurrency test, or if the city determines that an alternative calculation is required due to the size, scale, or other unusual characteristics of the proposed development, a fee for the alternative calculation shall be paid by the applicant prior to the initiation of review. Final determination of which test or calculation is used shall be within the sole discretion of the city. The fee for conducting the review of the alternative calculation shall be as set forth in the approved fee schedule. (Ord. 1865 § 8, 2015).


17.75.090 Exemptions.

17.76.010 Interpretation.

A. The director of planning and community development may interpret the provisions of this title. The decisions shall be in writing, kept in a publicly accessible place and updated as zoning code amendments render them obsolete. The process for making an interpretation shall be pursuant to Process Type II of Chapter 17.71 MMC (Permit Decision and Appeal Processes). 

B. Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this zoning code upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of this zoning code or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.

C. This zoning code is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement; provided, that where the regulations of this zoning code are more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the requirements of this zoning code shall govern.

D. No building, structure or use which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this zoning code shall become, or be made, lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this zoning code; and to the extent that, and in any manner, the unlawful building, structure or use is in conflict with the requirements of this zoning code, the building, structure or use remains unlawful under this code. (Ord. 1741 § 41, 2009; Ord. 1405 § 2, 1999).

17.78.020 Issuance – Contents.

A. Whenever the director or his/her designee has reason to believe that violation of any development regulation will be most equitably terminated by an administrative notice and order proceeding, he/she shall issue a written notice and order directed to either the owner or operator of the source of the violation, the person in possession of the property where the violation originates or the person otherwise causing or responsible for the violation.

B. The notice and order shall contain, and the director is authorized to require, the following:

1. The street address, when available, and a legal description of real property and/or description of personal property sufficient for identification of where the violation occurred or is located;

The director shall have the authority to impose a penalty of up to $1,000 per day per development regulation violation. Each day any structure or use fails to comply with a development regulation shall be deemed a separate violation;

5. Statements advising any of the following to the extent that the director chooses any as a remedy:

a. If any required work is not commenced or completed within the times specified, which may be immediately if circumstances warrant, the director will proceed to cause abatement of the violation as a public nuisance and cause the work to be done and charge the costs thereof as a joint and separate personal obligation of any person in violation to the extent permitted by law; and

b. If any assessed civil penalty is not paid, the director will charge the amount of the penalty as a joint and separate personal obligation of any person in violation; and/or

c. If any required compliance is not commenced or completed within the times specified, which may be immediately if circumstances warrant, the director will proceed with a permit suspension or revocation as authorized in MMC 17.79.010;

6. A statement advising that the order shall become final, unless, no later than 21 days after the notice and order are served, any person aggrieved by the order requests in writing an appeal before the hearing examiner. (Ord. 1862 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1580 § 3, 2003).


17.78.030 Issuance – Supplemental.

At any time other than during the pendency of an appeal, the director may add to, rescind in part or otherwise modify a notice and order by issuing a supplemental notice and order. The supplemental notice and order shall be governed by the same procedures applicable to all notice and orders contained in this title. The director may withdraw a notice and order at any time and also reissue the same notice and order or a modified version so long as reissuance is consistent with any appeal decision. (Ord. 1862 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1580 § 3, 2003).


17.78.040 Service.

Service of the notice and order shall be made upon all persons identified in the notice and order either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. If the address of any such person cannot reasonably be ascertained, a copy of the notice and order shall be mailed to such person at the address of the location of the violation and/or posted on the subject property. The failure of any such person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. Service by certified mail in the manner provided in this section shall be effective on the date of postmark. The notice and order may be, but is not required to be, posted on the subject property.

Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given at least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing to each appealing party, to the director, and to other interested persons who have requested in writing that they be so notified. The director whose order is being appealed may submit a report and other evidence indicating the basis for the enforcement order.

D. Following review of the evidence submitted, the hearing examiner shall make written findings and conclusions, and shall affirm or modify the order previously issued if the examiner finds that a violation has occurred. The burden of proof is upon the director to establish the commission of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. The examiner shall have the authority to modify any monetary penalties imposed by the director in the notice and order, including the authority to increase them. The examiner shall reverse the order if the examiner finds that no violation occurred. The written decision of the examiner shall be mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested to the parties. (Ord. 1862 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1580 § 3, 2003).

B. An order which is subject to the appeal procedure of MMC 17.78.060 shall be final and conclusive upon the date of the examiner’s decision. The examiner’s decision shall be appealable to superior court pursuant to applicable state statutes. (Ord. 1862 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1580 § 3, 2003).


17.78.075 Final order – Violation a misdemeanor.

The failure of a person or entity to comply with the applicable provisions of an order issued pursuant to MMC 17.78.010(B) or 17.78.070 shall constitute a misdemeanor subject to the penalties of RCW 9A.20.010(2), as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1862 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015; Ord. 1580 § 3, 2003).


17.78.080 Final order – Enforcement.

1. Failure of the holder to comply with the requirements of any requirement of MMC Titles 15 through 18, or rules or regulations adopted thereunder; or

2. Failure to comply with any notice and order issued pursuant to this title.

The holder or operator may appeal such suspension as provided by this title. The planning and community development director may pursue permit revocation as opposed to permit suspension if he/she determines that permit suspension will not accomplish code compliance or that suspension instead of revocation will result in significant adverse impacts to adjoining property owners or the community at large.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, whenever the planning and community development director finds that a violation of any land use ordinance, or rules and regulations adopted thereunder, has created or is creating a dangerous or other condition which, in his judgment, constitutes an immediate and irreparable hazard, he may, without service of a written notice and order, suspend and terminate operations under the permit immediately. (Ord. 1663 § 29, 2006; Ord. 1580 § 4, 2003).

1. Interpret and administer the policies, regulations and laws of the state in accordance with the policies set forth in SEPA and these rules;

3. Prepare environmental documents that are concise, clear and to the point, and are supported by evidence that the necessary environmental analyses have been made;

4. Initiate the SEPA process early in conjunction with other agency operations to avoid delay and duplication;

5. Integrate the requirement of SEPA with existing agency planning and licensing procedures and practices, so that such procedures run concurrently rather than consecutively;

6. Encourage public involvement in decisions that significantly affect environmental quality;

7. Identify, evaluate and require or implement, where required by the act and these rules, reasonable alternatives that would mitigate adverse effects of proposed actions on the environment. (Ord. 1627 § 2, 2004; Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).

I. Authority


18.04.030 Authority.

The city adopts this chapter under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), RCW 43.21C.120 and the SEPA rules, WAC 197-11-904, and this chapter contains the city’s procedures and policies under SEPA. Hereafter the SEPA rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC, shall be used in conjunction with this chapter. (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).

II. General Requirements


18.04.040 Purpose of this part and adoption by reference.

This part contains the basic requirements that apply to the SEPA process. The city adopts the following sections of Chapter 197-11 WAC by reference:

WAC

197-11-040    Definitions.

197-11-050    Lead agency.

197-11-055    Timing of the SEPA process.

197-11-060    Content of environmental review.

197-11-090    Supporting documents.

197-11-100    Information required of applicants. 

(Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.060 Designation of responsible officials.

For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the planning and community development director or his/her designee.

A. For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the “lead agency” or “responsible official” by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in WAC 173-806-020.

B. The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules (Chapter 197-11 WAC) and make them available in accordance with Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 1663 § 30, 2006; Ord. 1484 § 7, 2001; Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.070 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

A. The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

B. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall forward to the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements and, if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.

C. When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11 600.

D. If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city/county must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the responsible official.

E. The city is authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

F. When the city makes a lead agency determination for a private project it shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal (that is: which agencies require nonexempt licenses?). (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.080 Transfer of lead agency status to a state agency.

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.090 Additional timing considerations.

A. For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or draft EIS for the proposal shall accompany the staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission.

B. If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).

III. Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determinations


18.04.100 Purpose of this part and adoption by reference.

This part of this chapter contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a “probable significant, adverse environmental impact” requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This part also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference:

WAC 

197-11-300    Purpose of this part.

197-11-305    Categorical exemptions.

197-11-310    Threshold determination.

197-11-315    Environmental checklist.

197-11-330    Threshold determination process.

197-11-335    Additional information.

197-11-340    Determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

197-11-350    Mitigated DNS.

197-11-355    Optional DNS process.

197-11-390    Effect of threshold determination.

(Ord. 1837 § 4, 2014; Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.110 Use of exemptions.

A. Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

B. In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

C. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city/county may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that as authorized in WAC 197-11-070:

1. A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

2. A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.120 Environmental checklist.

A. A completed environmental checklist (or a copy) in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960 shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter, except a checklist is not needed if the city/county and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city/county shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city/county is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

B. For private proposals, the city/county will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance, as necessary. For city/county proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

C. The city/county may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

1. The city/county has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

2. The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).


18.04.130 Mitigated DNS.

A. As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

2. Precede the city/county’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 20 calendar days. The response shall:

1. Be written;

2. State whether the city/county currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city/county to consider a DS; and

3. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D. As much as possible, the city/county should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

E. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city/county shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

1. If the city/county indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city/county shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2);

2. If the city/county indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city/county shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate;

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent storm water runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200-foot storm water retention pond at Y location” are adequate;

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

F. Mitigated DNSs issued under WAC 197-11-340 require a 15-day comment period and public notice.

G. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city/county.

H. If the city/county’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city/county should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (Withdrawal of DNS).

I. The city’s written response under subsection B of this section shall not be construed as determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city/county to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 1405 § 3, 1999).

1. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS and the land use administrator determines that an EIS shall be prepared by the employees of the city, the city may charge and collect a reasonable fee from any applicant to cover cost incurred by the city in preparing the EIS. The city clerk shall advise the applicant of the projected costs for the EIS prior to actual preparation; the applicant shall post bond, or deposit $1,000 cash, or otherwise ensure payment of such costs.

2. The manager of the district may determine that the city will contract directly with a consultant for preparation of an EIS, or a portion of the EIS, for activities initiated by some persons or entity other than the city and may bill such costs and expenses directly to the applicant. The city may require the applicant to post bond, deposit $1,000 cash or otherwise ensure payment of such costs. Such consultants shall be selected by mutual agreement of the city and the applicant after a call for proposals.

3. If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the city clerk shall refund any fees collected under subsection (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section together with any interest accrued which remain after incurred costs are paid.

C. The city may collect a reasonable fee from an applicant to cover the cost of meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the applicant’s proposal.

D. The city shall not collect a fee for performing its duties as a consulted agency.

E. The city may charge any person for copies of any document prepared under this chapter and for mailing the document, in a manner provided by Chapter 42.17 RCW and Resolution No. 337.

F. Environmental checklist review pursuant to MMC 3.48.010 shall include review by the public works director or consulting engineer who shall submit a written report to the responsible official incorporating, if relevant, documentation of any off-site improvements to mitigate said impacts. The responsible official shall determine the reasonable cost to the city of the environmental checklist review and shall require the applicant to pay a fee in addition to the original deposit to cover the cost of such review. If the cost of review is substantially less than the environmental checklist review fee deposit the responsible official shall document the difference and refund said difference to the applicant, minus transaction costs incurred by the city in said refund process.

G. Voluntary Pre-Project Application Environmental Review. The potential applicant for any project action listed at MMC 3.48.010 may obtain an environmental review similar to the review set forth at subsection F of this section, upon payment of a fee deposit as set forth as relevant, MMC 3.48.010. The fee deposit shall be subject to the terms set forth at subsection F of this section.

“Alteration” means any human-induced activity that changes the existing condition of a critical area. Alterations include, but are not limited to, grading; filling; dredging; draining; channelizing; clearing or removing vegetation; discharging pollutants; paving; construction; or any other human activity that changes the existing landforms, vegetation, hydrology, fish, wildlife, or wildlife habitat of a critical area.

“Anadromous fish” means species, such as salmon, which are born in fresh water, spend a large part of their lives in the sea, and return to fresh water rivers and streams to procreate.

“Applicant” means the person, party, firm, corporation, or other entity that proposes any activity that could affect a critical area.

“Aquifer” means a saturated geologic formation that will yield a sufficient quantity of water to serve as a private or public water supply.

“Aquifer recharge areas” means areas where the prevailing geologic conditions allow infiltration rates which create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water. Aquifer recharge areas are classified as follows:

B. Minimize adverse impacts to surface water and ground water flow, circulation patterns, and to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of wetlands;

C. Protect trees and vegetation designated to be retained during and following site construction; and

D. Provide standards for proper use of chemical herbicides within critical areas.

The city shall monitor the application of best management practices to ensure that the standards and policies of this title are adhered to.

“Buffer” or “buffer area” means a naturally vegetated and undisturbed or revegetated zone surrounding a critical area that protects the critical area from adverse impacts to its integrity and value, or is an integral part of the resource’s ecosystem.

“City” means the city of Milton, including any department, official, board or body thereof with jurisdiction over the subject of this chapter.

“Clearing” means the removal of timber, brush, grass, ground cover, or other vegetative matter from a site that exposes the earth’s surface of the site or any actions that disturb the existing ground surface.

“Conservation easement” means a legal agreement that the property owner enters into to restrict uses of the land. Such restrictions can include, but are not limited to, passive recreation uses such as trails or scientific uses and fences or other barriers to protect habitat. The easement is recorded on a property deed, runs with the land, and is legally binding on all present and future owners of the property, therefore providing permanent or long-term protection.

“Creation” means bringing a wetland or stream corridor into existence at a site in which a wetland or stream corridor did not formerly exist.

“Critical areas” include any of the following areas or ecosystems: aquifer recharge areas, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, frequently flooded areas, geologically hazardous areas, and wetlands, as defined in Chapter 36.70A RCW and this chapter.

“Critical ecosystems” means environmentally sensitive areas subject to natural hazards or those landform features which in their natural state carry, hold or purify water and support unique, fragile or valuable natural resources such as fish, wildlife and other organisms. These areas also provide flood protection, shoreline stability and aid in recharging valuable ground water resources. These critical ecosystems include aquifer recharge areas, fish and wildlife habitat conservation and open space areas, frequently flooded areas, geologically hazardous areas, natural resource areas, stream corridors, wetlands and their associative transitional buffer zones.

“Critical facility” means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding, inundation, or impact from a hazard event might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations that produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.

“Critical geologic hazard areas” means lands or areas subject to high or severe risks of geologic hazard.

“Critical habitats” means those habitat areas which meet any of the following criteria:

However, wetlands do include those artificial wetlands intentionally created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

B. For inventory, incentives and nonregulatory purposes, wetlands are those lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For the purposes of this definition, wetlands must have one or more of the following attributes:

1. At least periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes;

2. The substrate is predominately un-drained hydric soil; or

3. The substrate is nonsoil, is saturated with water, or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of the year.

“Wetlands biologist” means a person who has earned a degree in biological sciences from an accredited college or university and has demonstrated experience in delineating wetland boundaries, analyzing wetland functions and values, and has experience in developing wetland mitigation plans. A professional person who has had equivalent education and training or with equivalent experience may also qualify as a wetlands biologist for the purpose of performing wetland delineations, analysis of functions and values and determination of possible mitigation subject to the approval of the land use administrator.

“Zone of contribution” means the area surrounding a well or spring that encompasses all areas or features that supply ground water recharge to the well or spring. (Ord. 1865 § 5, 2015; Ord. 1671 § 4, 2006).

18.12.030 Hearing examiner.

A. The hearing examiner, hereinafter known as the examiner, is vested with authority to:

1. Approve, approve with conditions, or deny shoreline variance and shoreline conditional use permits; provided, that any decisions on this matter made by the examiner may be further appealed to the State Shoreline Hearings Board as provided for in the Act;

2. Decide local administrative appeals of decisions of the administrator.

B. The duties and responsibilities of the examiner shall include:

1. As authorized in MMC Title 17, the examiner shall review and consider shoreline variance and shoreline conditional use permits, and administrative appeals of the administrator’s actions;

2. Approval, approval with conditions, or denial of shoreline variance and conditional use permits;

3. Conducting hearings on appeals of the administrator’s decisions, including appeals of decisions on shoreline substantial development permits;

4. Basing all decisions on shoreline permits or administrative appeals on the criteria established in this master program;

5. At the discretion of the examiner, requiring any applicant granted a shoreline permit to post a bond or other acceptable security with the city conditioned to assure that the applicant and/or his successors in interest shall adhere to the approved plans and all conditions attached to the shoreline permit. Such bonds or securities shall have a face value of at least 150 percent of the estimated development cost including attached conditions. Such bonds or securities shall be approved as to form by the city attorney. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.040 City council.

The city council shall have the authority in its discretion to approve any revisions or amendments to the master program in accordance with the requirements of the Act and related WACs. Proposed revisions or amendments may be submitted by any interested party. To become effective any amendments to the program must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Ecology, pursuant to RCW 90.58.190 and Chapter 173-26 WAC. The city council will approve any revisions or amendments to the master program in accordance with the requirements of the Act and related WACs. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.060 Applicability to shoreline substantial development permit.

Any person wishing to undertake substantial development or exempt development on shorelines shall apply to the administrator for a shoreline substantial development permit (SSDP) or a letter of exemption.

Whenever a development falls within the exemption criteria outlined below and the development is subject to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 10 or Section 404 permit, the administrator shall prepare a letter of exemption and transmit a copy to the applicant and the Washington State Department of Ecology. Exempt development as defined herein shall not require a substantial development permit, but may require a conditional use permit, variance, and/or a letter of exemption (WAC 173-27-050).

Before determining that a proposal is exempt, the administrator may conduct a site inspection to ensure that the proposal meets the exemption criteria. The exemption granted may be conditioned to ensure that the activity is consistent with the master program and the Shoreline Management Act. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.070 Exemptions.

Exemptions to the shoreline master program are found in Chapter 7 of the shoreline master program. Said exemptions are an exemption from the requirements for a shoreline substantial development permit, but may still require letter of exemption as discussed in MMC 18.12.080. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4,1996).


18.12.080 Letter of exemption.

Applicants for all nonshoreline permits or approvals within the shoreline area may be required (pursuant to WAC 173-27-050) to obtain a written “letter of exemption.” Said exemption is an exemption from the requirement for a shoreline substantial development permit, and not from the policies and regulations of the master program. This process verifies that the action is exempt and offers the applicant an itemization of master program policies and regulations along with other requirements applicable to the proposed project. In the case of development subject to the policies and regulations of this master program but exempt from the shoreline substantial development permit process, the city may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments and/or uses as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Shoreline Management Act and the master program. For example, the approval of a building permit for a single-family residence can be conditioned with provisions from the master program. Other permit approvals may be conditioned on the basis of the master program policy and use regulations as well. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.090 Fees.

A filing fee or fees in an amount established at MMC 3.48.010 shall be paid to the city at the time of application. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.100 Permit application.

The administrator shall provide the necessary application forms for shoreline substantial development, conditional use and variance permits. Pursuant to WAC 173-27-180, the applicant shall provide, at a minimum, the following information:

A. The name, address and phone number of the applicant. The applicant should be the owner of the property or the primary proponent of the project and not the representative of the owner or primary proponent.

B. The name, address and phone number of the applicant’s representative if other than the applicant. The name, address and phone number of the property owner, if other than the applicant.

C. Location of the Property. This shall, at a minimum, include the property address, parcel number, and identification of the section, township and range to the nearest quarter, quarter section or latitude and longitude to the nearest minute. All applications for projects located in open water areas away from land shall provide a longitude and latitude location.

D. Identification of the name of the shoreline (water body) that the site of the proposal is associated with. 

E. A general description of the proposed project that includes the proposed use or uses and the activities necessary to accomplish the project.

F. A general description of the property as it now exists including its current use, physical characteristics, improvements and structures.

G. A general description of the vicinity of the proposed project including identification of the adjacent uses, structures and improvements, intensity of development and physical characteristics.

H. A site development plan consisting of maps and elevation drawings, drawn to an appropriate scale to depict clearly all required information, photographs and text which shall include:

1. The boundary of the parcel(s) of land upon which the development is proposed.

2. The ordinary high water mark of all water bodies located adjacent to or within the boundary of the project. This may be an approximate location; provided, that for any development where a determination of consistency with the applicable regulations requires a precise location of the ordinary high water mark the mark shall be located precisely and the biological and hydrological basis for the location as indicated on the plans shall be included in the development plan. Where the ordinary high water mark is neither adjacent to or within the boundary of the project, the plan shall indicate the distance and direction to the nearest ordinary high water mark of a shoreline.

3. Existing and proposed land contours. The contours shall be at intervals sufficient to accurately determine the existing character of the property and the extent of proposed change to the land that is necessary for the development. Areas within the boundary that will not be altered by the development may be indicated as such and contours approximated for that area.

4. A delineation of all wetland areas that will be altered or used as a part of the development.

5. A general indication of the character of vegetation found on the site.

6. The dimensions and locations of all existing and proposed structures and improvements including but not limited to buildings, paved or graveled areas, roads, utilities, septic tanks and drainfields, material stockpiles or surcharge, and stormwater management facilities.

7. Where applicable, a landscaping plan for the project.

8. Where applicable, plans for development of areas on or off the site as mitigation for impacts associated with the proposed project shall be included and contain information consistent with the requirements of this section.

9. Quantity, source and composition of any fill material that is placed on the site whether temporary or permanent.

10. Quantity, composition and destination of any excavated or dredged material.

11. A vicinity map showing the relationship of the property and proposed development or use to roads, utilities, existing developments and uses on adjacent properties.

12. Where applicable, a depiction of the impacts to views from existing residential uses and public areas.

13. On all variance applications the plans shall clearly indicate where development could occur without approval of a variance, the physical features and circumstances on the property that provide a basis for the request, and the location of adjacent structures and uses. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.110 Permit process.

A. Notices and Scheduling of Hearings. When a complete application and associated information have been received by the administrator, the administrator shall cause a notice to be posted in a conspicuous manner on the property upon which the project is to be constructed in accordance with Chapter 17.71 MMC. The administrator shall also be responsible for delivering legal notice to the public within the area in which the development is proposed. Advertising costs will be the responsibility of the applicant, and will be included in the permit fee. Further, the burden of proving that a proposed development is consistent with the approval criteria and master program policies and regulations shall be the applicant’s.

The applicant shall be responsible for applying for a variance or conditional use permit. The examiner shall schedule a public hearing in the case of a conditional use or variance permit. No public hearing is required for shoreline substantial development permits. Any interested person may submit his/her written views upon the application to the city within 30 days of notice of application or notify the city of his/her desire to receive a copy of the action taken upon the application. All persons who so submit their views shall be notified in a timely manner of the action taken upon the application.

B. Application Review – Administrator Action. The administrator shall make recommendation in the case of variance and conditional use permits and decisions in the case of substantial development permits, based upon whether or not the proposed development and/or use is consistent with the laws, policies and procedures of the Act, related WACs as amended, and this master program as amended.

C. Public Hearings. One public hearing shall be held by the examiner regarding application for shoreline conditional use permits and shoreline variances.

The examiner or administrator shall review an application for a permit based upon the application, applicable SEPA documents (if required), evidence presented at the public hearing, written or oral comments from interested persons, and the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the administrator. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.120 Action by the hearing examiner.

The examiner shall either approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application. Scheduling of the required hearing shall be in accordance with the timing considerations identified in MMC Title 17.

The examiner shall review the application and make decisions regarding permits based upon whether the proposed development and/or use is consistent with the master program, policies and procedures of Chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act and its supporting WACs, written and oral comments from interested persons, and the comments and findings of the administrator.

A written notice of the public hearing at which the examiner considers the application shall be mailed or delivered to the applicant and all interested parties of record a minimum of 15 days prior to hearing.

The decision of the examiner shall be the final decision of the city on all applications and the city shall render a written decision including findings, conclusions, and a final order, and transmit copies of the decision within five days of the examiner’s final decision to the applicant, State Department of Ecology, Attorney General, and interested parties of record. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.130 Commencement of construction.

Development pursuant to a shoreline substantial development permit shall not begin and is not authorized until 21 days from the date the administrator files the approved permit with the Department of Ecology and the Attorney General or the conclusion of all review and appeal proceedings, whichever is later, unless otherwise authorized by RCW 90.58.140 as now or hereafter amended. Development pursuant to a shoreline variance or shoreline conditional use permit shall not commence and is not authorized until 21 days from the date the final decision is transmitted to the city or the conclusion of all review and appeal proceedings, whichever is later, unless otherwise authorized by RCW 98.58.140, as now or hereafter amended. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.140 Duration of permits.

The city may issue permits with termination dates of up to five years. If a permit does not specify a termination date, the following requirements apply, consistent with WAC 173-27-090:

A. Time Limit for Substantial Progress. Construction, or substantial progress toward completion, must begin within two years after approval of the permits.

B. Extension for Substantial Progress. The city may at its discretion, with prior notice to parties of record and the Department, extend the two-year time period for the substantial progress for a reasonable time up to one year based on factors including the inability to expeditiously obtain other governmental permits which are required prior to the commencement of construction.

C. Five-Year Permit Authorization. If construction has not been completed within five years of approval, the city will review the permit and, upon showing of good cause, will either extend the permit for one year or terminate the permit. Only one single-year extension is permitted. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.150 Revision of permits.

When an applicant desires to revise a permit, the applicant must submit detailed plans and text describing the proposed changes. A permit revision is required whenever the applicant proposes substantive changes to the design, terms or conditions of a project from that which is approved in the original permit approval. Changes are substantive if they materially alter the project in a manner that relates to its conformance to the terms and conditions of the permit, the master program and/or the policies and provisions of Chapter 90.58 RCW. Changes which are not substantive in effect do not require approval of a revision. If the city determines that the proposed changes are within the scope and intent of the original permit, and are consistent with the master program and the Shoreline Management Act, the city may approve a revision. “Within scope and intent of the original permit” means all of the following:

A. No additional over-water construction is involved, except that pier, dock or float construction may be increased by 500 square feet or 10 percent, whichever is less;

B. Ground area coverage and height is not increased more than 10 percent;

C. Additional structures do not exceed a total of 250 square feet;

D. The revision does not authorize development to exceed height, setback, lot coverage, or any other requirement of this master program;

E. Additional landscaping is consistent with conditions (if any) attached to the original permit;

F. The use authorized pursuant to the original permit is not changed; and

G. No substantial adverse environmental impact will be caused by the project revision.

If the sum of the proposed revision and any previously approved revisions do not meet the criteria above, an application for a new shoreline permit must be submitted. If the revision involves a conditional use or variance which was conditioned by the Department of Ecology, the revision also must be reviewed and approved by the Department of Ecology (see WAC 173-27-100).

A city or department decision on revision to the permit may be appealed to the Shorelines Hearings Board within 21 days of such decision, in accordance with RCW 90.58.180 and WAC 173-27-100.

Construction allowed by the revised permit that is not authorized under the original permit is undertaken at the applicant’s own risk until the expiration of the appeals deadline. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.160 Local appeals.

Any decision made by the administrator on a substantial development permit, master program policy or regulation interpretation, permit revision, or other action within the purview and responsibility of the administrator may be appealed to the examiner under the procedures prescribed in Chapter 17.71 MMC. The examiner, using the applicable decision making criteria established in the master program, shall affirm, modify, or reverse the decision subject to appeal. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.170 Appeal to State Shorelines Hearings Board.

Any person aggrieved by the granting, denying, rescission or modification of a shoreline permit may seek review from the State Shorelines Hearings Board within 21 days of receipt of the final decision by the final decision maker of the city. Said request shall be in the form required by the rules for practice and procedure before the Shorelines Hearings Board, and the person seeking review shall file a copy of the request for review with the State Department of Ecology and the Attorney General. Shorelines Hearings Board regulations are contained in WAC Title 461. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.180 Shoreline variances and conditional use permits.

Provisions for shoreline conditional use permits and variances are found in Chapter 7 of the shoreline master program. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.190 Unclassified uses.

Other uses, categorized as “unclassified uses,” which are not classified in Table 3 of the master program, may be authorized as conditional uses; provided the applicant can demonstrate, in addition to the criteria set forth above, that extraordinary circumstances preclude reasonable use of the property in a manner consistent with the use regulations of the master program. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.195 Department of Ecology review.

After the examiner’s approval of a conditional use or variance permit, the administrator shall submit the permit to the Department of Ecology for its approval, approval with conditions, or denial. Upon receipt of Ecology’s decision, the administrator shall notify those interested persons having requested notification of such decision. (Ord. 1803 § 3, 2012; Ord. 1290 § 4, 1996).


18.12.210 Enforcement and penalties.

The choice of enforcement action and the severity of any penalty will be based on the nature of the violation and the damage or risk to the public or to public resources. The existence or degree of bad faith of the persons subject to the enforcement action, the benefits that accrue to the violator, and the cost of obtaining compliance may also be considered.

A. Civil Penalty.

1. Action. The city attorney, as authorized by the mayor with council approval, shall bring such injunctive, declaratory, or other actions as are necessary to ensure that no uses are made of the shorelines of the state in conflict with the provisions of the Act and this master program and to otherwise enforce the provisions of the Act and the master program.

2. Noncompliance. Any person who fails to conform to the terms of a permit issued under the master program or who undertakes a development or use on the shorelines of the state without first obtaining any permit under the master program or who fails to comply with a cease and desist order issued under regulations shall also be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation. Each permit violation or each day of continued development without a required permit shall constitute a separate violation.

3. Aiding and Abetting. Any person who, through an act of commission or omission procedures, aids, or abets in the violation shall be considered to have committed a violation for the purposes of the civil penalty.

4. Notice of Penalty. The penalty provided for in this section shall be imposed by a notice in writing, either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service, to the person incurring the same from the city. The notice shall include the “content of order” specified in subsection (A)(6) of this section, “Cease and Desist Order.”

5. Remission and Order. Within 30 days after the notice is received, the person incurring the penalty may apply in writing to the city for remission or mitigation of such penalty. Upon receipt of the application, the city may remit or mitigate the penalty only upon a demonstration of extraordinary circumstances, such as the presence of information or factors not considered in setting the original penalty. Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section solely by the city shall be subject to review by the city council pursuant to RCW 90.58.210(4). In accordance with RCW 90.58.050 and 90.58.210(4), any penalty jointly imposed by the city and the Department of Ecology shall be appealed to the Shorelines Hearings Board. When a penalty is imposed jointly by the city and the Department of Ecology, it may be remitted or mitigated only upon such terms as both the city and the Department agree.

6. Cease and Desist Order. Content of order shall set forth and contain:

a. A description of the specific nature, location, extent, and time of violation and the damage or potential damage; and

b. A notice that the violation or the potential violation cease and desist or, in appropriate cases, the specific corrective action to be taken within a given time. A civil penalty under this section may be issued with the order and same shall specify a date certain or schedule by which payment will be complete.

7. Effective Date. The cease and desist order issued under this subsection shall become effective immediately upon receipt by the person to whom the order is directed.

8. Compliance. Failure to comply with the terms of a cease and desist order can result in enforcement actions including, but not limited to, the issuance of a civil penalty.

B. Delinquent Permit Penalty. Permittees applying for a permit after commencement of a use or activity may at the discretion of the city be required, in addition, to pay a delinquent permit penalty not to exceed three times the appropriate permit fee paid by the permittee. A person who has caused, aided, or abetted a violation within two years after the issuance of a regulatory order, notice of violation, or penalty by the city or the Department against said person may be subject to a delinquent permit penalty not to exceed 10 times the appropriate permit fee paid by the permittee. Delinquent permit penalties shall be paid in full prior to resuming the use or activity.

C. Property Lien. Any person who fails to pay the prescribed penalty as authorized in this section shall be subject to a lien upon the affected property until such time as the penalty is paid in full. The city attorney shall, upon authorization by the mayor and city council, file said lien against the affected property at the office of the county assessor.

D. Mandatory Civil Penalties. Issuance of civil penalties is mandatory in the following instances:

1. The violator has ignored the issuance of an order or notice of violation.

2. The violation causes or contributes to significant environmental damage to shorelines of the state as determined by the city.

3. A person causes, aids, or abets in a violation within two years after issuance of a similar regulatory order, notice of violation, or penalty by the city against said person.

E. Minimum Penalty Levels.

1. Regarding all violations that are mandatory penalties, the minimum penalty is $250.00.

2. For all other penalties, the minimum penalty is $100.00.

F. General Criminal Penalty. In addition to incurring civil liability under the civil penalty section, any person found to have willfully engaged in activities on the shorelines of the state in violation of the provisions of the Act or master program shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 90 days for each separate offense, or by both such fine and imprisonment; provided, that the fine for each separate offense for the third and all subsequent violations in any five-year period shall be not less than $500.00 nor more than $10,000.

18.16.010 Purpose.

A. The purpose of this chapter is to designate and protect ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas in accordance with the Growth Management Act, while also allowing for reasonable use of private property.

B. By limiting and regulating development and alteration of critical areas, this chapter seeks to:

1. Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures, erosion, seismic events, volcanic eruptions, or flooding;

2. Maintain healthy, functioning ecosystems through the protection of unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, and fish and wildlife and their habitats, and to conserve the biodiversity of plants and animal species;

3. Direct activities not dependent on critical areas resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas; and

4. Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality, wetlands, and fish and wildlife habitat, and the overall net loss of wetlands, frequently flooded areas and habitat conservation areas so that there will be no net loss of wetlands, and our goal is to increase the quality and vitality of wetland acreage.

C. This chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this chapter to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable use of the property or to prevent the provision of public facilities and services necessary to support existing development and that planned for by the community. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.020 Authority.

A. As provided herein, the land use administrator, or his or her designee, is given the authority to interpret and apply and the responsibility to enforce this chapter to accomplish the stated purpose. The land use administrator or his or her designee is authorized to adopt administrative rules as necessary and appropriate to implement this chapter and to prepare and require the use of such forms as necessary for its administration.

B. The city council may withhold, condition, or deny development permits or activity approvals to ensure that the proposed action is consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.030 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

Any individual critical area adjoined by another type of critical area shall have the buffer and meet the requirements that provide the most protection to the critical areas involved. When any provision of this chapter or any existing regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflicts with this chapter, that which is more restrictive shall apply. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.040 Severability.

If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such order or judgment shall be confined in its operation to the controversy in which it was rendered. The decision shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any part thereof and to this end the provisions of each clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this law are hereby declared to be severable. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.050 Applicability.

A. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands, all land uses and development activity, and all structures and facilities in the city, whether or not a permit or authorization is required, and shall apply to every person, firm, partnership, corporation, group, governmental agency, or other entity that owns, leases, or administers land within the city. No person, company, agency, or applicant shall alter a critical area or buffer except as consistent with the purposes and requirements of this chapter.

B. Approval of a permit or development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

C. The approximate location and extent of critical areas may be shown on city maps and on maps prepared by county, state, federal and other agencies. These maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. They are a reference and do not provide a final critical areas designation. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.060 Fees.

Unless otherwise indicated in this chapter, the applicant shall be responsible for the initiation, preparation, submission, and expense of all required reports, assessment(s), studies, plans, reconnaissance(s), peer review(s) by qualified consultants, and other work prepared in support of or necessary to review the application. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.070 Appeals.

Any decision to approve, condition, or deny a development proposal or other activity based on the requirements of this chapter may be appealed to the hearing examiner according to, and as part of, the appeal procedure for the permit or approval involved. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.080 Exemptions.

All exempted activities shall use reasonable methods to avoid potential impacts to critical areas. To be exempt from this chapter does not give permission to degrade a critical area or ignore risk from natural hazards. Any incidental damage to, or alteration of, a critical area that is not a necessary outcome of the exempted activity shall be restored, rehabilitated, or replaced at the responsible party’s expense. The following developments, activities, and associated uses shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter:

A protocol shall be included outlining the schedule for site monitoring (for example, monitoring shall occur in years one, three, five and seven after site construction), and how the monitoring data will be evaluated to determine if the performance standards are being met. A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project. The compensation project shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years.

6. Contingency Plan. The mitigation plan shall include identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates project performance standards are not being met. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).

The city may levy civil penalties against any person, party, firm, corporation, or other legal entity for violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. The civil penalty shall be assessed at a maximum rate of $1,000 per day per violation. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).

Article II. Wetlands


18.16.310 Wetlands designation and classification.

A. Wetlands Designation. Wetlands are designated in accordance with the approved federal wetlands delineation manual and applicable regional supplement. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

1. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from non-wetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway.

2. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands.

B. Wetlands Classification. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington – 2014 update (Department of Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, October 2014 – Effective January 2015, or as revised). This document contains the definitions, methods and a rating form for determining the categorization of wetlands described below:

1. Category I wetlands include those that receive a score of 23 through 27 based on functions, or those that are rated Category I based on special characteristics as defined in the rating form.

2. Category II wetlands include those that receive a score of 20 through 22 based on functions, or those that are rated Category II based on special characteristics as defined in the rating form.

3. Category III wetlands include those that receive a score of 16 through 19 based on functions.

4. Category IV wetlands score less than 16 points based on functions. (Ord. 1865 § 6, 2015; Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.320 Performance standards.

A. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this chapter. Activities may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas, or that the impacts to the functions and values will be fully mitigated.

B. Category III and IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet may be exempted or partially exempted from the provisions of this chapter and may be altered by filling or dredging as outlined below.

1. Category III and IV wetlands less than 1,000 square feet are exempt where:

a. The wetland is isolated;

b. The wetland is not associated with a riparian corridor;

c. The wetland is not part of a wetland mosaic, as defined by the Washington State Department of Ecology;

d. The wetland does not contain Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife-designated priority species or habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species.

2. Category III and IV wetlands between 1,000 and 4,000 square feet may be exempted from the mitigation sequencing requirement to first avoid impacts where:

a. A critical areas report is performed in accordance with MMC 18.16.140; and

b. The wetland meets the criteria listed in subsection (B)(1) of this section; and

c. The proposed plan includes full mitigation.

C. Wetland Buffers.

1. Buffer Requirements. The standard buffer widths in Table 1 – “Wetland Buffers” have been established in accordance with the best available science. They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State wetland rating system for western Washington.

a. The use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the measures in Table 2, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

b. If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 2 – “Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands,” then a 33 percent increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a 75-foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a 100-foot buffer without them.

c. The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

d. If the wetland is a Category I or II wetland with a habitat score greater than five points and it is located within 300 feet of a priority habitat area as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the applicant shall provide a relatively undisturbed vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide between the wetland and the priority habitat area. The corridor shall be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat through a conservation easement, native growth protection easement or the equivalent.

2. Measurement of Wetland Buffers. Buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

3. Where a legally established and constructed public roadway transects a wetland buffer, the department may approve a modification of the standard buffer width to the edge of the roadway, provided:

a. The isolated part of the buffer does not provide additional protection of the wetland; and

b. The isolated part of the buffer provides insignificant biological, geological or hydrological buffer functions relating to the wetland; and

c. The resulting buffer distance is less than 50 percent of the standard or optional buffer for the applicable wetland category, no further reduction shall be allowed.

4. Where a buffer has been previously established after 1996 through a city development review and is permanently recorded on title or placed within a separate tract, the buffer shall be as previously established.

5. Buffer Width Increasing. The land use administrator may require the standard buffer to be increased by the greater of 50 feet or a distance necessary to protect wetland functions and provide connectivity to other wetland and habitat areas for one of the following:

a. To maintain viable populations of existing species listed by the federal or state government as endangered, threatened or sensitive; or

b. To protect wetlands against severe erosion that standard erosion control measures will not effectively address; or

c. When a Category I, II or III wetland is located within 300 feet of:

i. Another Category I, II, or III wetland;

ii. A fish and wildlife habitat conservation area; or

iii. A Type S or F stream as defined in MMC 18.16.620;

the increased buffer distance may be limited to those areas that provide connectivity or are necessary to protect wetland and habitat functions. If the wetland contains variations in sensitivity, increasing the buffer widths will only be done where necessary to preserve the structure, function and value of the wetland.

6. Wetland Buffer Width Averaging. Buffer width averaging may be allowed by the land use administrator if all of the following criteria are met:

a. It will provide additional protection to wetlands or enhance their functions, as long as the total area contained in the buffer on the development proposal site does not decrease;

b. The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;

c. The buffer width is not reduced to less than 50 percent of the standard buffer width at any location; and

d. Buffer width averaging may be used in conjunction with buffer reduction options in this section, provided the total combined reduction does not reduce the buffer to less than 50 percent of standard buffer width at any location.

7. Reduction of Wetland Buffer Widths. Standard buffer widths may be reduced up to 50 percent when buffer width reduction impacts are mitigated and result in equal or greater protection of the wetland functions. Prior to considering buffer reductions, the applicant shall demonstrate application of mitigation sequencing as required in MMC 18.16.150. A plan for mitigating buffer-reduction impacts must be prepared using selected incentive-based mitigation options from the list below. The following incentive options for reducing standard buffer widths shall be considered cumulative up to a maximum reduction of 50 percent of the standard buffer width. In all circumstances where a substantial portion of the remaining buffer is degraded, the buffer reduction plan shall include replanting with native vegetation in the degraded portions of the remaining buffer area and shall include a five-year monitoring and maintenance plan.

a. Installation of biofiltration/infiltration mechanisms: up to 20 percent reduction in the standard buffer width may be allowed for the installation of bioswales, created and/or enhanced wetlands, or ponds supplemental to existing storm drainage and water quality requirements in accordance with Chapter 13.26 MMC.

b. Removal of existing impervious surfaces:

i. Up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width if impervious surfaces within the to-be-remaining buffer area are reduced by at least 50 percent; or

ii. Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width if the to-be-remaining buffer area is presently more than 50 percent impervious and all of it is to be removed.

c. Removal of invasive, nonnative vegetation: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width for the removal and extended (minimum five-year) monitoring and continued-removal maintenance of relatively dense stands of invasive, nonnative vegetation from significant portions of the remaining buffer area.

d. If not already required under an existing development proposal, installation of oil/water separators for storm water quality control: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width.

e. Use of pervious material for driveway/road construction: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width.

f. Restoration of off-site area if no on-site area is possible:

i. Up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width if restoration area is at a 2:1 ratio or greater; or

ii. Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width if restoration area is at a 4:1 ratio or greater.

g. Removal of significant refuse or sources of toxic material: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width.

8. The land use administrator may also consider buffer reductions for decreasing impacts to buffers using methods such as low impact development (LID).

9. Buffer conditions shall be maintained. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed condition.

D. Signs and Fencing of Wetlands.

1. Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and inspected by the land use administrator prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

2. Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the land use administrator may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

a. Permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability.

b. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity.

c. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the land use administrator:

Protected Wetland Area

Do Not Disturb

Contact [local contact information]

Regarding Uses and Restriction

3. Fencing.

a. The city shall condition any permit or authorization to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland.

b. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. (Ord. 1865 § 7, 2015; Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.330 Wetland mitigation requirements.

A. Mitigation and mitigation plans shall be developed consistent with the Department of Ecology Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans, 2006, or as revised.

B. Compensatory Mitigation General Provisions.

1. Replace wetland impacts with the same or higher category of wetland.

2. Compensatory mitigation shall be conducted on property which shall be protected and managed to avoid further loss or degradation. The applicant or violator shall provide for long-term preservation of the compensation area.

3. Compensatory mitigation shall follow an approved mitigation plan.

4. Enhancement of existing wetlands, other than Category I and Category II wetlands, may be considered for compensation.

5. Compensation shall be completed prior to, or concurrently with, wetland loss, or, in the case of an enforcement action, prior to further development of the site.

C. Mitigation Ratios.

1. Any person who alters or proposes to alter regulated wetlands shall restore or create areas of wetland in order to compensate for wetland losses. The wetlands to be created or restored shall be in kind (i.e., the same type of wetland) and accomplished prior to or concurrently with loss. The ratio of lost wetlands to newly created or restored shall be determined in accordance with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance, March 2006, or as revised.

2. Mitigation ratios shall be as follows:

	Category of Wetland Impacts	Reestablishment or Creation	Rehabilitation Only	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Rehabilitation (RH)	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	Category I	6:1	12:1	1:1 (R/C) and 10:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 20:1 (E)	24:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 (R/C) and 4:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 8:1 (E)	12:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 (R/C) and 2:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 4:1 (E)	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 (R/C) and 1:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 2:1 (E)	6:1

3. Decreased Replacement Ratio. The city may decrease these ratios under the following circumstances:

a. Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high likelihood of success;

b. Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being impacted; or

c. The proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of the impact and have been shown to be successful.

D. On-site compensation is generally preferred over off-site compensation. Off-site compensation allows replacement of wetlands away from the site on which the wetland has been impacted by a regulated activity. The following conditions apply to off-site compensation:

1. Off-site compensation shall occur within the same drainage basin of the same watershed where the wetland loss occurs; provided, that Category IV wetlands may be replaced outside of the watershed if there is no reasonable alternative. In such instances, the storm water storage function provided by Category IV wetlands must be provided for within the design of the development project.

2. Off-site compensation can be allowed only under one or more of the following circumstances:

a. On-site compensation is not feasible due to hydrology, soils, or other factors;

b. On-site compensation is not practical due to probable adverse impacts from surrounding land uses or would conflict with a federal, state or local public safety directive;

c. Potential functions and value at the site of the proposed restoration are greater than the lost wetland functions and value;

d. When the wetland to be altered is of a limited function and value and is degraded, compensation shall be of the wetland community types needed most in the location of compensation and those most likely to succeed with the highest functional value possible.

E. Out-of-kind compensation can be allowed when out-of-kind replacement will best meet the provisions of this section and the mitigation sequence outlined in MMC 18.16.150.

F. Selecting Compensation Sites.

1. Except in the case of cooperative compensation projects in selecting compensation sites, applicants shall pursue locations in the following order of preference:

a. Filled, drained, or cleared sites which were formerly wetlands and where appropriate hydrology exists;

b. Upland sites, adjacent to wetlands, if the upland is significantly disturbed and does not contain a mature forested or shrub community of native species, and where the appropriate natural hydrology exists.

2. Where out-of-kind replacement is accepted, greater restoration/creation ratios may be required.

G. Timing. Construction of compensation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing wildlife and plants. Construction shall be timed to assure that grading and soil movement occurs during the dry season and planting of vegetation shall be specifically timed to needs of the target species.

H. Alternative Compensation Projects. The land use administrator may encourage, facilitate and approve innovative wetland mitigation projects. Advance compensation or mitigation banking are examples of alternative compensation projects allowed under the provisions of this section wherein one or more applicant(s), or an organization with demonstrated capability, may undertake a compensation project together if it is demonstrated that all of the following circumstances exist:

1. Creation of one or several larger wetlands may be preferable to many small wetlands;

2. The group demonstrates the organizational and fiscal capability to act cooperatively;

3. The group demonstrates that long-term management of the compensation area will be provided;

4. There is a clear potential for success of the proposed compensation at the identified compensation site;

5. Conducting compensation as part of a cooperative process does not reduce or eliminate the required replacement ratios outlined above. Exception: where a compensatory mitigation plan including a five-year monitoring agreement is included as a condition of approval, such plan shall allow for 1:1 replacement ratios upon successful completion of the monitoring agreement.

I. Wetlands Enhancement as Mitigation. Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by enhancement of existing significantly degraded wetlands. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands must produce a critical areas report that identifies how enhancement will increase the functions of the degraded wetland and how this increase will adequately mitigate for the loss of wetland area and function at the impact site. An enhancement proposal must also show whether existing wetland functions will be reduced by the enhancement actions. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.340 Subdivisions.

The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands and associated buffers is subject to the following:

A. Land that is located wholly within a wetland or its buffer may not be subdivided.

B. Land that is located partially within a wetland or its buffer may be subdivided; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is:

1. Located outside of the wetland and its buffer; and

2. Meets the minimum lot size requirements.

C. Access roads and utilities serving the proposed subdivision may be permitted within the wetland and associated buffers only if the city determines that no other feasible alternative exists in and when consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).

Article III. Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas


18.16.410 Critical aquifer recharge areas designation.

Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARA) are those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). CARA include:

A. Those aquifer recharge areas that have prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates that create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water.

B. Wellhead protection areas defined by the boundaries of the 10-year time of ground water travel, or boundaries established using alternate criteria approved by the Department of Health in those settings where ground water time of travel is not a reasonable delineation criterion, in accordance with WAC 246-290-135.

C. Those critical aquifer recharge areas delineated by a hydrogeologic study prepared in accordance with the State Department of Ecology guidelines.

D. Susceptible ground water management areas as designated pursuant to Chapter 173-100 WAC.

E. Special protection areas as defined by WAC 173-200-090.

F. Those aquifer recharge areas meeting the criteria for susceptibility or vulnerability established by the State Department of Ecology. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).


18.16.430 Performance standards.

Development on or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall meet the following requirements:

A. For projects where the construction of structures and improvements, including additions, results in more than 30 percent total site impervious surface area, the applicant shall provide surface water infiltration according to the following:

1. Seventy-five percent of on-site storm water volume generated from the proposed development shall be infiltrated; provided, that a lesser standard may apply or on-site infiltration may be waived when:

a. The applicant demonstrates that infiltration is not a reasonable alternative due to site-specific soil and/or geologic conditions;

b. It is determined that increased saturation of soils would result in an increased risk to existing facilities and/or adjacent properties;

c. Infiltration would result in significant unavoidable impacts to other critical areas or result in an excessive loss of native vegetation; or

Article IV. Geologically Hazardous Areas


18.16.510 Geologically hazardous areas designation.

Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as a geologically hazardous area:

A. Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are at least those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “moderate to severe,” “severe,” or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard.

B. Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Examples of these may include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Areas of historic failures, such as:

a. Those areas delineated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development;

b. Those areas mapped by the Department of Ecology (Coastal Zone Atlas) or the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (“U” or Class 3), unstable old slides (“UOS” or Class 4), or unstable recent slides (“URS” or Class 5); or

c. Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources;

2. Areas with all three of the following characteristics:

a. Slopes steeper than 15 percent; and

b. Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and

c. Springs or ground water seepage;

3. Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;

4. Slopes that are parallel or subparallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and fault planes) in subsurface materials;

5. Slopes having gradients steeper than 80 percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking;

6. Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by wave action;

7. Areas that show evidence of, or are at risk from, snow avalanches;

8. Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; and

9. Any area with a slope of 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least 10 feet of vertical relief.

C. Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are areas subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake-induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface faulting. One indicator of potential for future earthquake damage is a record of earthquake damage in the past. Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage in Washington. Settlement and soil liquefaction conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesionless, loose, or soft-saturated soils of low density, typically in association with a shallow ground water table.

D. Mine Hazard. Mine hazard areas are those areas underlain by or affected by mine workings such as adits, gangways, tunnels, drifts, or airshafts, and those areas of probable sink holes, gas releases, or subsidence due to mine workings. Factors that should be considered include: proximity to development, depth from ground surface to the mine working, and geologic material.

E. Volcanic Hazard Areas. Volcanic hazard areas are areas subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows, debris avalanche, inundation by debris flows, lahars, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from volcanic activity.

F. Other Hazard Areas. Geologically hazardous areas shall also include areas determined by the land use administrator to be susceptible to other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement. (Ord. 1671 § 5, 2006).

6. Requirement of a performance security in accordance with MMC 18.16.200, when necessary, to ensure completion and success of proposed mitigation.

D. Buffers.

1. Establishment of Buffers. The city shall require the establishment of buffer areas for activities adjacent to habitat conservation areas when needed to protect the habitat conservation areas. Required buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the habitat and the type and intensity of human activity proposed to be conducted nearby.

2. Riparian Habitat Buffers. A riparian habitat buffer shall have the following width, unless a lesser width is allowed pursuant to subsection (D)(4) of this section. Widths shall be measured outward in each direction, on the horizontal plane, from the ordinary high water mark or from the outer edge of the floodway, whichever is greater.

	Water Type	Riparian Buffer

	S	165 feet

	F	150 feet

	Np	115 feet

	Ns	 65 feet

3. Increasing Buffer Widths. The land use administrator has the authority to increase the standard buffer widths when such buffers are necessary for one of the following:

a. To protect priority fish or wildlife using the habitat conservation areas. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation from the Departments of Ecology and Fish and Wildlife, showing that the increased buffer width is reasonably related to the protection of the fish and/or wildlife using the HCA;

b. To provide connectivity when a Type S or F water body is located within 300 feet of:

i. Another Type S or F water body;

ii. A fish and wildlife habitat conservation area; or

iii. A Category I, II, or III wetland;

c. When the frequently flooded area exceeds the recommended riparian habitat area width, the riparian habitat area shall extend to the outer edge of the frequently flooded area.

The increased buffer distance may be limited to those areas that provide connectivity or are necessary to protect habitat functions. Increasing the buffer widths will only be done where necessary to preserve the structure, function and value of the habitat.

4. Buffer Averaging. Buffer width averaging may be allowed by the city if:

a. It will provide additional natural resource protection, as long as the total area contained in the buffer on the development proposal site does not decrease;

b. The stream contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the stream would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places; and

c. The buffer width is not reduced to less than 50 percent of the standard buffer.

5. Buffer Reduction. Buffers may be reduced when buffer reduction impacts are mitigated and result in equal or greater protection of the stream functions. Prior to considering buffer reductions, the applicant shall demonstrate application of mitigation sequencing as required in MMC 18.16.150. A plan for mitigating buffer-reduction impacts must be prepared using selected incentive-based mitigation options from the list below, and is subject to approval by the city. The following incentive options for reducing standard buffer widths shall be considered cumulative up to a maximum reduction of 50 percent of the standard buffer width. In all circumstances where a substantial portion of the remaining buffer is degraded, the buffer reduction plan shall include replanting with native vegetation in the degraded portions of the remaining buffer area and shall include a five-year monitoring and maintenance plan.

a. Installation of biofiltration/infiltration mechanisms: up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width for the installation of bioswales, created and/or enhanced wetlands, or ponds supplemental to existing storm drainage and water quality requirements.

b. Removal of existing impervious surfaces:

i. Up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width if impervious surfaces within the to-be-remaining buffer area are reduced by at least 50 percent; or

ii. Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width if the to-be-remaining buffer area is presently more than 50 percent impervious and all of it is to be removed.

c. Removal of invasive, nonnative vegetation: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width for the removal and extended (minimum five-year) monitoring and continued-removal maintenance of relatively dense stands of invasive, nonnative vegetation from significant portions of the remaining buffer area.

d. In-stream habitat enhancement:

i. Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width for log structure placement, bioengineered bank stabilization, or culvert removal; or

ii. Up to 30 percent reduction in standard buffer width for improving fish passage and/or creation of side channel or backwater areas.

e. If not already required under an existing development proposal, installation of oil/water separators for storm water quality control: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width.

f. Use of pervious material such as pervious interlocking concrete paving blocks, concrete grid pavers, perforated brick pavers, and compacted gravel for driveway/road construction: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width.

g. Restoration of off-site area if no on-site area is possible:

i. Up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width if restoration area is at a 2:1 ratio or greater; or

ii. Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width if restoration area is at a 4:1 ratio or greater.

h. Removal of significant refuse or sources of toxic material: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width.

i. Ten percent for preparation of, and agreement to adhere to, a vegetation management plan that includes appropriate limitations on the site use of fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides as needed to protect water quality.

j. Ten percent for limiting lawn area to no greater than 20 percent of the lot area. Landscaped areas outside of the lawn and buffer areas shall be maintained or planted in noninvasive vegetation.

The land use administrator may also consider buffer reductions for decreasing impacts to buffers using methods such as low impact development (LID).

E. Signs and Fencing of Habitat Conservation Areas. In accordance with MMC 18.16.320(D).

F. Subdivisions. In accordance with MMC 18.16.340.

G. Anadromous Fish.

1. All activities, uses, and alterations proposed to be located in water bodies used by anadromous fish or in areas that affect such water bodies shall adhere to the following standards:

a. Activities shall be timed to occur only during the allowable work window as designated by the Department of Fish and Wildlife for the applicable species;

b. Shoreline erosion control measures shall be designed to use bioengineering methods or soft armoring techniques according to an approved critical areas report.

2. Structures that prevent the migration of salmonids shall not be allowed in the portion of water bodies currently or historically used by anadromous fish. Fish bypass facilities shall be provided that allow the upstream migration of adult fish and shall prevent fry and juveniles migrating downstream from being trapped or harmed.

3. Fills, when authorized by the adopted shoreline master program, shall not adversely impact anadromous fish or their habitat or shall mitigate any unavoidable impacts, and shall only be allowed for a water-dependent use.

H. Allowed Uses. The following specific activities may be permitted within a riparian habitat area, pond, lake, water of the state, or associated buffer when the activity complies with the following standards and the adopted shoreline master program:
