SHELBURNE ZONING BYLAWS 
ARTICLE I: PURPOSE. 
These regulations shall be known and cited as the Shelburne Zoning Bylaws (the Bylaws).  Vermont’s Municipal and Regional Planning and Development Act, 24 V.S.A., Chapter 117 (the Act), both grants municipalities the authority to adopt zoning bylaws and limits the purposes to which such bylaws may be used. Consistent with Section 4302(a) of the Act, these Bylaws are intended to, among other things: 
A. 	Ensure appropriate development which will promote the public health and safety. 
B. 	Promote prosperity, comfort, access to adequate light, air, convenience, efficiency, economy and general welfare; 
C. 	Encourage appropriate architectural design; 
D. 	Encourage appropriate development of renewable resources; 
E. 	Protect residential, agricultural and other areas from undue concentrations of population and overcrowding of land and buildings, from traffic congestion, from inadequate parking and the invasion of through traffic, and from the loss of peace, quiet and privacy; 
F. 	Preserve and protect the Town’s scenic and natural resources; and 
G. 	Facilitate the appropriate growth of the village and its surrounding neighborhoods so as to create an optimum environment.  
The Zoning Bylaws classify and guide the uses of land, buildings and structures in the Town of Shelburne in accordance with the Town's Comprehensive Plan (the "Plan") and the Act, as amended from time to time.  The Bylaws are designed to implement the purposes and policies set forth in the Plan and the Act, while having due consideration for the property rights of all property owners. 

ARTICLE II: ZONING DISTRICTS 
200 Classes of Districts. 
200.1 	For the purposes of these regulations, the Town of Shelburne is divided into the following zoning districts and overlay districts as shown on the official zoning maps which are filed in the Town office and incorporated herein by reference.  Reduced copies of the official maps are attached to these Bylaws.

210 	Interpretation of District Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
210.1  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines.  
210.2  Boundaries indicated as approximately following plotted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines.  
210.3  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks or to be the centerline of the right-of-way if no tracks are present.  
210.4  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow the mean low water mark (93’) per National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 29.  

210.5 	Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of those features identified in Subsections 1 through 4 above shall be so construed.  Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map or described under each zone shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
210.6 	District Boundary Adjustment:  Where a district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership at the time of passage of these regulations, the Development Review Board may permit, as a conditional use, the extension of the regulations beyond the boundary line into the remaining portion of the lot for a distance not to exceed fifty (50) feet. 
A. 	Approval of a district boundary adjustment under this provision must be obtained prior to submission of an application for approval of any development on the affected parcels. 
B. 	An application for a district boundary adjustment must include a site plan showing anticipated improvements and a description of anticipated uses in the area where the district boundary adjustment will take place.  If the district boundary adjustment will allow a totally different type of project than could occur without the adjustment, the Conditional Use review shall consider then entire project. 
C. 	Any district boundary adjustment granted under this section shall expire within two years unless all final local approvals for any development requiring the adjustment have been obtained. 
210.7 	Any uncertainty as to the boundaries of a zoning district shall be determined in accordance with the above Subsections by the Zoning Administrative Officer. 
220 Allowable Uses. Table 1 on the following pages is a generalized list of Permitted (P) and Conditional (C) uses allowed in each zoning district.  More details on allowable uses and limitations are found in Articles III through XVIII which describe the individual zoning districts and overlay districts. In the event there is a conflict between Table 1 and text found in Articles III through XVIII, the text found in Articles III through XVIII shall control. 
221 Dimensional Requirements. Table 2 below is a generalized list of dimensional requirements in each zoning district.  More specifics on dimensional requirements are found in Articles III through XVIII which describe the individual zoning districts and overlay districts. In the event there is a conflict between Table 1 and text found in Articles III through XVIII, the text found in Articles III through XVIII shall control.

1. 	
The Development Review Board must find that the structure proposed for demolition has deteriorated to the degree that rehabilitation and reuse of the structure is not feasible.  It is the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that no feasible alternative to demolition, including rehabilitation, preservation, or relocation, exists, or 

2. 	
The Development Review Board must find that the proposed redevelopment of the site after the demolition will provide a clear and substantial benefit to the community as a whole.  It is the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that such a benefit will result; 

and all of the following conditions are met: 

3. 	
The demolition and redevelopment proposal mitigates, to the greatest extent practicable, any impact on historic structures on the subject property or adjacent properties; 

4. 	
All historically and architecturally important design features, construction techniques, examples of craftsmanship, and materials, have been properly documented using applicable standards of the Historic American Building Survey and made 

available to historians, architectural historians, and others interested in Shelburne’s architectural history, and 

5. 	
The applicant has an approved redevelopment plan which provides replacement structures that are compatible with the historic integrity and the architectural character of the surrounding area.  Note: This requirement may be waived if the applicant agrees to place a deed restriction on the property limiting it to open space or recreation uses for the community at large. 


B. 	For structures not listed in the references noted in sub-section A, above, demolition may be approved if the Development Review Board finds that: 
1. 
The proposed demolition shall not adversely impact the character and context of other historic structures on the subject property or on adjacent properties, including those separated by roads. 

2. 	
The development proposed to replace the demolished structure shall not have an adverse impact on the architectural and historical context of the overlay district. 


C 	If the Development Review Board finds that the proposed demolition does not meet the standards set forth in sub-paragraphs A or B, it may deny the application or impose a delay of up to six months, during which time the applicant shall be directed to explore alternatives to demolition, including, but not limited to, renovation, preservation, or relocation of the structure. At the end of such delay, the Development Review Board shall convene a second hearing to consider the proposed demolition. 
6. 
If the applicant demonstrates that a reasonable effort to find alternatives to demolition has been made, and all other applicable requirements have been met, the demolition may be approved. 

7. 
If the applicant cannot demonstrate that a reasonable effort to find alternatives to demolition has been made, the demolition shall be denied. 


D. 	If a structure for which demolition has been proposed has been damaged in excess of seventy (70) percent of its assessed value due to flood, fire, wind, or other act of God, permission for the demolition may be granted by the Administrative Officer, without prior review by the SHPDRC or Development Review Board.

ARTICLE XVII.A: SHELBURNE ROAD FORM-BASED OVERLAY DISTRICT (SR-FBOD) 
[Bound separately in document displaying date 2-1-2017] 
ARTICLE XVIII: 	FLOODPLAIN AND WATERCOURSE OVERLAY DISTRICT 
1800 Statutory authorization and purpose. 
1800.1  The provisions of this Article regulating areas of special flood hazard are adopted to effect the purposes of V.S.A. Chapter 32 in accordance with the provisions of 24 V.S.A., Section 4424. These regulations shall apply to development, as defined at 1870.4 below, in all areas in the Town of Shelburne identified as areas of special flood hazard on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps. 
1800.2      It is the goal of this Article to minimize adverse impacts of development upon the sensitive natural areas adjacent to Shelburne's various watercourses and to minimize public and private loss caused by periodic flooding conditions.  More specifically, this Article seeks to preserve water quality, prevent pollution, avoid erosion, and protect the ecology of stream beds and lands adjacent to watercourses. 
It is the further purpose of this Article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, to prevent increases in flooding caused by the uncontrolled development of lands in areas of special flood hazard, and to minimize losses due to floods by: 
A. 	Restricting or prohibiting use and development that is dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or which causes excessive increase in flood heights or velocities. 
B. 	Requiring that structures and uses vulnerable to flood, including public facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement. 
C. 	Protecting individuals from the acquisition of property that is unsuited for their intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
1805 Permit Required. 
A permit is required from the Administrative Officer (AO) for all development in all areas defined in Section 1810 below. Development that requires conditional use approval, non-conforming use approval, or a variance from the Development Review Board (DRB) under these flood hazard regulations, must have such approvals prior to the issuance of a permit by the ZA. Any permit issued will require that all other necessary permits from State or Federal Agencies have been received before work may begin. 
1810 Overlay District Boundaries. 
1810.1  	The Floodplain and Watercourse Overlay District shall consist of the following areas, which are shown as the Floodplain and Watercourse Overlay District on the Shelburne Zoning Overlay District Map. 
A. 	All areas in Shelburne designated as Special Flood Hazard Area in and on the most current flood insurance studies and maps published by the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Program, as provided by the Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources pursuant to 10 V.S.A. Chapter 32 § 753, which are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of these regulations. The location of the boundary shall be determined by the Administrative Officer (AO). If the applicant disagrees with the determination made by the AO, a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA shall constitute proof. 
B. 	All land within thirty-seven (37) feet of the Special Flood Hazard Area. 
C. 	All land within 100 feet of the centerline of the LaPlatte River, McCabe's Brook and the south branch of Munroe Brook, plus all land within 50 feet of the centerline of the north branch of Munroe Brook and other Munroe Brook tributaries. 
D. 	The area comprising the channels of all watercourses described in paragraphs b and c above. 
1810.2  	Where available, base flood elevations and floodway limits provided by the National Flood Insurance Program and in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps shall be used to administer and enforce these regulations. In Special Flood Hazard Areas where base flood elevations and/or floodway limits have not been provided by the National Flood Insurance Program in the Flood Insurance Study and accompanying maps, it is the applicant’s responsibility to develop the necessary data. Where available, the applicant shall use data provided by FEMA, or State, or Federal agencies. Where BFE data are utilized in Zone A, the Town will receive and maintain records of the lowest floor and flood proofing elevations for new and substantially improved construction. In Zones AE, AH, and A1 
– A30 where base flood elevations and/or floodway limits have not been determined, development shall not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated encroachment, will not increase the base flood elevation more than 1.00 foot at any point within the community. The demonstration must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles and certified by a registered professional engineer. 
1810.3 	These regulations shall apply to the Special Flood Hazard Areas and identified buffer areas in the Town of Shelburne, Vermont as described above in sections 1810.1.a-1810.1.d. These hazard areas overlay any other existing zoning districts and the regulations herein are the minimum standards that must be met before meeting the additional standards applicable in the underlying district. 
1810.4 	The Zoning Administrative Officer shall determine the boundaries of this overlay district by scaling distances on the applicable Shelburne Federal Insurance Administration Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or other officially adopted Floodplain map or by using digital versions of those maps by utilizing a geographic information system (GIS).  On receipt of any application for a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrative Officer shall determine whether the proposed development is located within the areas of special flood hazard or other portions of the overlay district. If uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the Special Flood Hazard Area or the floodway, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the Administrative Officer (AO). If the applicant disagrees with the determination made by the AO, a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA shall constitute proof. 
1810.5 The Zoning Administrative Officer shall maintain a record of the elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest habitable floor, including basement, of all substantial improvements of structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement, as well as the elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which such structures have been flood proofed. 
1815 Enforcement, Precedence of Regulations, and Validity and Severability. 
1815.1 	The regulation of activities within areas of Special Flood Hazard or floodways shall be enforced under the municipal zoning bylaw in accordance ith 10 VSA § 1974a, § 4451, and § 4452. A copy of the notice of violation will be mailed the State NFIP Coordinator. 
1815.2 	If any appeals have been resolved, but the violation remains, the AO shall submit a declaration to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program requesting a denial of flood insurance to the property pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance 
Act of 1968, as amended. 
1815.3 	Violations of the Accepted Agricultural Practices shall be enforced under this Section as violations of this bylaw. Such violations shall also be immediately reported to the Secretary of Agriculture for enforcement under 6 V.S.A. Section 4812. 
1815.4 	The provisions of these flood hazard regulations shall not in any way impair or remove the necessity of compliance with any other local, state, or federal laws or regulations. Where this flood hazard regulation imposes a greater restriction the provisions here shall take precedence. 
1815.5 	If any portion of this bylaw is held unconstitutional or invalid by a competent court, the remainder of this bylaw shall not be affected. 
1816 Supplemental Application Materials. 
All applications under this section shall contain a Vermont Agency of Natural Resources Project Review Sheet for the proposal. The Project Review Sheet shall identify all State and Federal agencies from which permit approval is required for the proposal, and shall be filed as a required attachment to the municipal permit application. The identified permits, or letters indicating that such permits are not required, shall be submitted to the AO and attached to the permit before work can begin.

H. 
I. 
All substantial improvement of nonresidential structures have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one foot above the base level elevation, or have the lowest floor, including basement, and attendant utility and sanitary facilities of all substantial improvement be flood proofed to at least two feet above the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight with walls impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Structures be (1) designed and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure during the occurrence of the base flood; (2) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; (3) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage, and (4) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities, that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. Any encroachment, including fill, substantial improvement, or other development, be prohibited that will result in any increase in flood levels within the regulatory floodway during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Further, encroachments or development above grade and less than one foot above the base flood elevation, are prohibited unless hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, by a registered professional engineer, certifying that the proposed development will: a) Not result in any increase in flood levels (0.00 feet) during the occurrence of the base flood; and b) Not increase any risk to surrounding properties, facilities, or structures from erosion or flooding. Public utilities may be placed underground, and the analyses may be waived, where a registered professional engineer certifies that there will be no change in grade and the utilities will be adequately protected from scour. The flood carrying capacity within any portion of an altered or relocated water course be maintained. All gas and electrical equipment, circuits, and appliances be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. All new and replacement water supply systems be designed so as to minimize or prevent the infiltration of flood waters into the system. All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems be designed to minimize or prevent infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. All replacement manufactured homes shall be elevated on properly compacted fill such that the top of the fill (the pad) under the entire manufactured home is above the base 100 year flood elevation. 
J. 	Fully enclosed areas below grade on all sides (including below grade crawlspaces and basements) are prohibited. Fully enclosed areas that are above grade, below the lowest floor, below BFE and subject to flooding, shall a. Be solely used for parking of vehicles, storage, or building access, and such a condition shall clearly be stated on any permits; and, b. Be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Such designs must be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings on two walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
K. 	All development in fringe areas shall be designed (1) to minimize flood damage to the proposed development and to public facilities and utilities, and (2) to provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
L. 	On-site waste disposal systems be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
M. 	All necessary permits be obtained from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law. 
N. 	Recreational vehicles on sites within special flood hazard areas shall be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use. 
O. 	Development will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
1840 Variances. 
1840.1  	Variances may be granted in writing by the Development Review Board only in accordance with all the criteria in 24 V.S.A., Sections 4469, 4424(E), and 44 CFR Section 60.6, after a warned public hearing. Any variance issued in the Special Flood Hazard Area will not increase flood heights.  
1840.2  	Any variance issued in the Special Flood Hazard Area will also inform the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level increases risks to life and property and will result in increased premiums for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of coverage. 
1840.3  	The Development Review Board shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including copies of notifications provided pursuant to Section 1840.2. 
1850 	Watercourse channel alteration. Except as allowed by and in conformance with Section 2020.1 of these bylaws, there shall be no diversion of watercourses, and no alteration of stream banks or stream beds.  No land use, land development, or other activity conducted on land adjacent to areas designated in Section 1810.1 shall be conducted in such a way as to result in soil erosion, effluent discharge, artificial surface water runoff, or any other discharges into the bodies of water described in Section 1810.1 above. 
1860 	Scope of regulations. This Article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage.

ARTICLE XIX: GENERAL REGULATIONS 
It is the purpose of Article XIX to set forth the regulations that must be satisfied by development in the Town of Shelburne before a zoning permit may be issued for that development.  Some of the regulations apply to all developments.  Others apply to only those developments specified in this Article or elsewhere in these Regulations. The provisions of this article are intended to promote, among other things, multimodal connectivity within sites, between adjacent sites and neighborhoods, and to transit and public roads. 
1900 Site Plan Review. 
A. Site Plan Approval prior to issuance of a zoning permit is authorized by 24 V.S.A., Section 4416. The purpose of site plan review is to ensure that the layout and design of development on pre-existing or approved lots conform to the Town Plan of record, these Regulations, and applicable conditions of previous subdivision and conditional use approvals. Standards specifically relate to the internal layout of a site, its physical design, and the functional integration of the site with adjoining properties, uses, and infrastructure. With regard to connectivity, the purpose of site plan review is to achieve, among other things, safe and efficient access to and circulation within and between a property for vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. 
B. 	With the exception of one and two family dwellings on individual sites, the approval of site plans by the Development Review Board shall be required prior to the issuance of a zoning permit for all uses, including conditional uses in any district (except where specifically exempted by the requirements of individual districts in Articles III-XVIII of these Regulations), and any change of use that requires a change in building footprint or layout of parking or circulation, or any other change to the site layout.   In reviewing site plans, the Development Review Board will require safeguards with respect to the adequacy of parking, traffic access, circulation for pedestrians and vehicles, traffic control devices, landscaping and screening, and the protection of renewable energy resource, exterior lighting, the size, location, and design of signs, and other matters specified below.  The Development Review Board shall conduct a public hearing to consider any application for Site Plan Approval in accordance with the provisions of 24 V.S.A., Section 4464, and as may be described in Article XX of these Regulations. The Development Review Board shall act to approve or disapprove any such site plan within forty five (45) days of the adjournment of the public hearing, and failure to so act within such period shall be deemed approval. 
1900.1 Pre-Submission Conference. Prior to formal submission, applicants are urged to meet in person with staff to discuss the proposed development and site plan.  The intent of such discussion is to review the basic design concept, identify any relevant site issues, and to advise the applicant of any potential problems and concerns 
1900.2 Applications. Applications for site plan approval shall be filed with eight 
(8) 
sets of full sized (at least size D or E sheets) maps, plus eight (8) sets of reduced size (11” x 17”) maps and corresponding digital (PDF) files, along with accompanying written materials, which shall include at least the following items in printed and digital (PDF) format.

A detailed traffic impact analysis prepared by a qualified person or firm is required for any application that is expected to add 75 or more peak hour (AM or PM) vehicle trip ends to the transportation system. The requirement for a traffic impact study may be waived by the DRB upon a finding that an application would have a de minimis impact on traffic congestion and safety. Any traffic analysis prepared under this section will meet the following criteria: 
1. 	
The analysis will examine the existing traffic and the traffic added by the proposed development to public roads serving the development and any major intersections within one half mile of the development. 

2. 	
The analysis will examine the impact of proposed traffic generation on current traffic levels on the existing roads and on traffic levels anticipated on the public roads five years after the proposed development opens. 

3. 	
The analysis will include the cumulative contribution and impact of any currently permitted but not constructed or not fully constructed developments, including the impacts of any  phases not yet built. 

4. 	
The analysis shall be based on analytic techniques set forth in the current edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (Manual) published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 

5. 	
Local traffic counts forming the basis of the analysis shall be conducted at times of the year and at times of the day deemed appropriate by the DRB, as determined by factors such as seasonal variations in traffic and school operating schedules. 


B. The traffic analysis must demonstrate that the level of service (LOS), as defined in the Manual, on all roads and intersections within the analysis area will not be less than “C” at any time during the future five year period, provided that an LOS of “D” may be acceptable in the Village Center District. 
C. If the minimum LOS required under 1900.9B cannot be demonstrated, the applicant must present roadway or intersection improvements that must be installed in order to maintain the required LOS.

1900.16 Decisions. The Board may decide to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. The Board shall render its decision within forty five days of the close of the public hearing, and failure to act within such time shall constitute approval. 
1900.17 Conditional Use Review as element of Site Plan Review. Land development subject to Sections 1900 and 1910 as of May 2, 2018, shall be subject to the requirements of Section 1910 by virtue of the authority found in § 4414 (3) as well as by virtue of the authority § 4416 (a), and Conditional Use requirements shall apply unless specifically exempted by this bylaw. 
1910 	Conditional Uses. The purpose of conditional use review is to allow certain specified uses to occur in the various zoning districts, provided that specified criteria are met and certain conditions satisfied.  Such uses are called conditional uses, and may only occur after being approved in accordance with the procedures described in this section 
1910.1 Jurisdiction. A use designated as a conditional use in any district shall only be established, enlarged, or intensified upon Conditional Use approval by the Development Review Board after public notice and a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of 24 V.S.A., Section 4464, and as may be described in Article XX of these Regulations. 
1910.2 Applications. Applications for Conditional Use approval shall be filed in the same manner as applications for Site Plan approval, as specified in Section 1900.1, except that such applications shall also address the following: 
A. 	Other information specified in the Conditional Use Review Procedure and Checklist endorsed by the Development Review Board. 
B. 	An application will not be considered complete, and will not be scheduled before the Development Review Board, until all information listed in Conditional Use Review Procedure and Checklist has been submitted. 
C. 	Any other data or information that the Development Review Board shall reasonably view as necessary in applying the Conditional Use review standards. 
1910.3 Exemption. Within a given zoning district, a change from one conditional use to another conditional use of the same category shall not require conditional use approval, provided that the new conditional use occupies no more floor area than the original conditional use.  For example, within a zoning district that allows retail uses as a conditional use, a change from one retail establishment to another retail establishment in the same space shall not require conditional use approval.    
1910.4 Review. Before granting Conditional Use approval, the Development Review Board must determine that the proposed conditional use complies with the specific dimensional, and other standards applicable to it as set forth in these regulations, and that the proposed conditional use will not result in an undue adverse effect on: 
A. 	The capacity of existing or planned public community facilities. 
B. 	The character of the area affected, as defined by the purpose or purposes of the zoning district in which the project is located, and specifically stated policies and standards of the municipal plan or open space plan. 
C. 	Traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity.  The creation of high traffic entry and exiting due solely to a single establishment along Route 7 should be discouraged. 
D. 	The Town Comprehensive Plan and all bylaws and ordinances then in effect. 
E. 	The utilization of renewable energy resources. 
F. 	Historic buildings and sites. 
1. 	
Historic buildings and sites include those identified in any of the following references:  Historic Sites and Structures Survey, Shelburne, Book 1 and 2, prepared by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, Historic Sites and Structures Survey Report for the Town of Shelburne prepared by Pamela Daly (2000), or the Shelburne Village National Register Historic District nomination (1990),  or which are listed on or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

2. 	
The proposed conditional use shall not in anyway endanger the structural integrity of any historic building (for instance by increased vibration, surface water or ground water). 

3. 	
The proposed conditional use shall not adversely impact the setting of any historic building or site (for instance by obstructing traditional views of such buildings or sites). 

4. 
The proposed conditional use shall not involve the exterior modification of any historic building that does not reflect and reinforce the historic design of the structure. 


1910.4B.  	Other specific review criteria.  Before an applicant can receive Conditional Use Approval, the applicant must demonstrate to the Development Review Board that the proposed conditional use will: 
A. 	Have sufficient water and waste water treatment for its needs, and will not result in an unreasonable burden on the Town’s present or planned water or waste water treatment systems. 
B. 	Have adequate traffic access, circulation, and parking, and will not cause unreasonable traffic congestion or unsafe conditions with respect to pedestrian or vehicular travel. 
C.  	Not cause an unreasonable burden on the Town or School Districts’ ability to provide educational services, 
D.  	Not place an unreasonable burden on the Town’s ability to provide services, including but not limited to fire protection, police protection, ambulance service, public works, and recreation services. 
E. 	Not have an adverse impact on the present and projected housing needs of the Town in terms of the number, type, and location of units. 
F. 	Not have an undue adverse impact on the economic vitality of Shelburne Village.

A. 	In addition to those criteria set forth elsewhere in this section, conditional uses in the Village Residential District and the Shelburne Falls Mixed Use District must satisfy the following: 
1. 	
The proposed use must not detract from the predominant residential character of the area. 

2. 	
If the proposed use is to be located in an existing residential structure, the exterior of that structure may not be modified in a way that significantly changes its residential appearance from the street. 

3. 	
If all or part of the proposed use is to be located in an addition to an existing residential structure, the addition shall be designed to present to the street a continuation of the residential character of the original building. 

4. 	
If the proposed use is to be located in a new structure, the design of that structure shall reflect the scale and residential character of the neighborhood. 

a. 	
The footprint shall not be more than 125% of the footprints of buildings on adjacent parcels. 

b. 	
Facades visible from the street shall convey a residential character (such as siding, types and sizes of windows, doors, and other architectural features) similar to that of surrounding buildings.

5. 
The traffic generated by the proposed conditional use shall be similar to that generated by other uses in the immediate area. 


1910.6 Integrated Agriculture as a Conditional Use. 
A. 	Purpose. The purpose of this section is to specify provisions for the accommodation of agriculture-related activities that are not exempt from zoning regulation because they are not recognized as exempt according to 24 VSA § 4413 (d).  
B. 	Review of Integrated Agriculture. In the Rural district, any proposal to conduct Integrated Agriculture shall be reviewed as a conditional use. Integrated Agriculture is not a conditional or permitted use in any other zoning district within the Town of Shelburne. 
C. 	Secondary Integrated Agricultural Activities. Provided that the Development Review Board finds that the proposed Primary Integrated Agricultural Activities, as defined in Article XXI of these Regulations, meet the applicable general and specific conditional use standards set forth in the Zoning Bylaws, and, subject to conditions deemed necessary by the Development Review Board in order to assure that the proposed activities will not be detrimental to the other uses within the district or to adjoining uses, Integrated Agriculture may  include the following (“Secondary Integrated Agricultural Activities”): 
1. 	
sales of non-farm products related to those grown on the farm; and/or 

2. 	
hosting of educational and cultural events incidental to farming or the farm’s activities. 


D. Revenue Criteria. At least two-thirds of the gross revenue attributable to Integrated Agricultural activities shall be derived from Primary Integrated Agricultural Activities; and no more than one-third of such gross revenue may be derived from Secondary Integrated Agricultural Activities. Any conditional use approval of a Secondary Integrated Agricultural Activity shall be conditioned upon the permittee’s continuing obligation to provide the Town’s Zoning Administrator, upon request, with a certification of the relative percentages of such gross revenues over the prior fiscal year, and such other information as may be reasonably requested by the Zoning Administrator in order to determine revenue percentages and compliance with the conditions imposed by the Development Review Board in its conditional use approval. 
1910.7 Kennels and Pet Car Facilities as a Conditional Use. 
A. Purpose.	  The purpose of this section is to specify standards applicable to Kennels and Pet Care Facilities where such uses are authorized as Conditional Uses. 
B. Review of Kennels and Pet Care Facilities.	  In districts where Kennels and Pet Care Facilities are authorized as Conditional Uses, any proposal for such use or uses must demonstrate the use or uses will satisfy the following standards and requirements, unless waived by the Development Review Board per paragraph 1910.7.C. below, in addition to all other applicable standards and requirements: 
1. 	
All Outdoor Pet Exercise Areas shall be either enclosed or fenced and screened on all sides. 

2. 	
Animals shall not be permitted in Outdoor Pet Exercise Areas between 9:00 pm and 7:00 am. 

3. 	
Where a parcel on which a Kennel or Pet Car Facility is proposed is adjacent to or within fifty (50) feet of the boundary of a residential district or existing residential use, the required side or rear setback for the Outdoor Pet Exercise Area shall be sixty-five (65) feet from the residential or residentially-zoned property.  A strip not less than fifteen (15) feet wide within the sixty-five (65) foot setback shall be landscaped with dense evergreens, fencing, and/or other plantings as a screen.  New external light fixtures shall not be permitted within the fifteen 


(15) foot wide buffer area. 
4. 	Where a parcel on which a Kennel or Pet Care Facility use is proposed is adjacent to or within one hundred (100) feet of the boundary of a residential district or existing residential use, the application seeking approval of such use shall, prior to the close of the public hearing, be supported by a certification by an acoustical engineer that the construction practices and/or materials of the structure used as a Kennel or Pet Care Facility will comply with the noise standards contained in section 1950.2.C.  The acoustical professional shall submit relevant information to permit the Development Review Board to verify that any measures proposed to attenuate noise will comply with the noise standards contained in section 1950.2.C. 
C. 	Waiver of Standards and Requirements in 1910.7.B.1-1910.7.B.4. The Development Review Board may, at its sole discretion, waive any of the Standards and Requirements contained in 1910.7.B.1­
1910.7.B.4, if it determines that the proposal, in light of its location, parcel size, existing vegetation or topography, or surrounding uses, is unlikely to have negative impacts greater than any comparable conditional use. 
1910.8 Adult Entertainment as a Conditional Use. 
A. Purpose.	  The purpose of this subsection is to mitigate the adverse secondary impacts associated with adult entertainment facilities while not unduly limiting freedom of speech and expression. Restrictions on the location and operation of such facilities are necessary to protect residential neighborhoods, sensitive and vulnerable populations, civic institutions and public gathering places from the adverse secondary impacts associated with adult entertainment facilities including, but not limited to, crime, nuisance, disturbance of public order and indecency, and to protect public health, safety and welfare. 
B. Review of Adult Entertainment Facilities.	  In districts where Adult Entertainment Facilities are authorized as Conditional Uses, any proposal for such use must demonstrate the use will satisfy the following standards and requirements, in addition to all other applicable standards and requirements: 
1. 	
The impact of the adult entertainment use must be comparable to a non-adult entertainment use allowed (permitted or conditional) in the applicable zoning district. 

2. 	
Adult entertainment uses must not be located within 600 feet of an existing grade school, library, daycare facility, religious facility, public park, or residential zoning district or within 150 feet of a public right-of-way. This distance will be measured from the property line of the subject lot to the nearest property line of the lot housing one of the listed uses. If a grade school, library, daycare facility, religious facility or public park subsequently locates within 600 feet of a lawfully existing adult entertainment use, this provision will not be used to eliminate or restrict that adult entertainment use. 

3. 	
Adult entertainment uses must be separated from one another by at least 1,000 feet. This distance will be measured from the property line of the subject lot to the nearest property line of another lot housing an adult entertainment use. 

4. 	
An adult entertainment use must not have any storefront window, marquee, sign or other display visible from a public vantage point depicting or portraying specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities. 

5. 	
Adult oriented merchandise must not be displayed in a location that would be visible from a public vantage point. 

6. 	
Adult entertainment uses may be identified with signage in accordance with Section 1970. All text, symbols, logos or other 

graphics advertising an adult entertainment use must use only terms and imagery that would be typical and expected for a comparable non-adult entertainment use and appropriate for a general audience. 

7. 	
A person under the age of 18 must not be permitted to enter or remain on the premises of an adult entertainment use. All public entrances must have prominent warning sign indicating that only those age 18 or older may enter. To be prominent a sign must occupy an area of at least 4 square feet and use letters at least four inches in height. 

8. 	
All building openings, entries and windows of Adult Oriented Business Establishments shall be located, covered or screened in such a manner as to prevent a view into the interior from any public or semi-public area, including public sidewalks, streets, arcades, hallways, or passageways of any material which has as its primary theme matter depicting, illustrating, or describing, Specified Anatomical Areas or Specified Sexual Activities.

1920.1 Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use may be continued, provided that the following conditions are met: 
A. 	No nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use without conditional use approval by the Development Review Board, provided that the Development Review Board finds that the total floor area occupied by the proposed use is no greater than the floor area occupied by the existing non-conforming use. 
B. 	A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or has been changed to or replaced by a conforming use, may not be reestablished regardless of the intent to resume the nonconforming use.  A nonconforming use shall be deemed to be discontinued if the use is not actively pursued on the premises, or if equipment, furniture, or other appurtenances associated with the use have been removed from the premises. 
C. 	A nonconforming use shall not be extended to displace a conforming use. 
D. 	Except as specified in this paragraph, no building or structure used for a nonconforming use shall be increased by an addition or separate structure unless the added space is entirely occupied by a conforming use.  
E. 	A structure housing a nonconforming use, if destroyed or damaged by fire, collapse, explosion or similar cause may be re-built or repaired for the nonconforming use, provided that the nonconforming use is not extended, expanded or enlarged in any way, and provided that such re-build or repair is completed within two years of the damage or destruction. 
F. 	Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of a structure housing a nonconforming use, provided that such action does not increase the degree of or create any new nonconformance. 
1920.2 Nonconforming Structures. A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied, and may be modified, subject to the following: 
A. 	Nothing in these regulations shall be construed as permitting the use of a structure declared unsafe by an appropriate governmental authority nor the continuation of a condition declared to be a health hazard by an appropriate governmental authority. 
B. 	Except as noted below, a nonconforming structure may be extended or expanded provided that the entire expansion or extension meets all applicable setback requirements for the district in which it is located. 
1. 	
In the Mixed Use District, the Commerce and Industry District, and the Commerce and Industry South District, a structure that is nonconforming by virtue of extending into the required front setback from Shelburne road may be expanded or extended if such expansion or extension does not extend any closer to Shelburne road than the existing structure. 

2. 	
In the Rural District, a structure that is nonconforming by virtue 


of the structure extending into the required front setback, may be expanded or extended if such expansion or extension does not extend any closer to the lot frontage than the existing structure, except that in no case shall the building footprint of the expansion exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the existing building footprint. Such expansion or extension may occur within a required side yard setback so long as the expansion or extension does not extend any closer to the side boundaries than the existing structure. 
C. A nonconforming structure may not undergo significant revision to major architectural elements (e.g., building massing, roof shape, entry arrangement, or fenestration pattern) without prior conditional use approval of the Development Review Board under Section 1910 of these Regulations. 
D. A non-conforming structure may be modified, but not expanded or extended, by minor changes to doors or windows, upon approval by the Administrative Officer. 
E. 	A nonconforming structure, the use of which has been discontinued for a continuous period of two (2) years shall not be re-occupied.  The use of a structure shall be considered discontinued if all of the following conditions exist:

The structure is unoccupied and not actively offered for sale. 

2. 	
Regular maintenance of the structure is not performed. 

3. 	
The structure is not served by activated utilities. 


F. 	A nonconforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other similar unintended cause may be re-built, repaired or restored, provided that the Zoning Administrator determines that the re-build or repair results in a structure that is no more nonconforming than the original structure, and that the work is completed within two years of the damage or destruction.  The Zoning Administrator may grant one year extensions to this deadline if it is demonstrated that the delays were unavoidable and that the work is progressing. 
G. 	A nonconforming structure may be demolished and re-built, provided that the new structure is no more nonconforming than the original structure. 
H. 	A nonconforming structure may be moved on the site, provided that the new location results in the structure being as the least nonconforming solution feasible on the site, and that it is no more nonconforming than in the original location.  For the purpose of this paragraph, the phrase “least nonconforming solution feasible” shall mean the following: 
1. 	
The amount of the building’s footprint that extends into the 

required setback is as small as possible. 

2. 	
The maximum distance that any portion of the building extends into the required setback is as small as possible. 

3. 	
The total floor area built within the required setback is as small as possible, and 

4. 	
The total volume of enclosed structure located above the maximum building height is as small as possible. 


I. 	For the purposes of paragraphs ‘F’ G, and ‘H’ of this sub-section, the phrase “no more nonconforming” shall mean the following: 
1. 	
The total area of building footprint of the new or re-built building that extends into the required setback is no more than the total area of building footprint of the original building that extended into the required setback. 

2. 	
The total floor area in the portion of the new or re-built building that extends into the required setback is no more than the total floor area of the portion of the original building that extended into the required setback, and

In accordance with 24 V.S.A., Section 4417, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are permitted in various zoning districts, as authorized by Articles III through XVIII describing the individual zoning districts. In addition to any specific purposes specified below, it is the intent of this section to implement the goals and objectives of the Town Plan, to encourage the orderly development of the land, to protect important scenic and natural features of the landscape, to encourage effective neighborhood design, and ensure the unified and integrated design of development projects. 
1930.1 	Review Process. 
A. 	In accordance with the provisions of 24 V.S.A., Section 4417, and as may be specified in Article XX of these Regulations, the Development Review Board shall conduct public hearings to consider applications for Planned Unit Development approval. All PUDs shall be considered to be major subdivisions under the Subdivision Regulations. 
B. 	The Development Review Board may conduct all development reviews associated with the development (e.g. site plan approval, planned unit development approval, subdivision approval) simultaneously. 
C. 	Except as may be limited in Articles III through XVIII describing individual zoning districts, the Development Review Board may modify applicable area and dimensional requirements, excluding the periphery buffer, simultaneously with the approval of the subdivision plat. 
1930.2 	General Standards. 
A. 	A site plan shall be submitted to the Development Review Board with a preliminary subdivision plat application showing the location, height and space of buildings, building envelopes, open spaces, parking spaces, streets, driveways, landscaping, and all other significant or unique physical features (including but not limited to waterways, wetlands, flood plains, fields, forested areas and tree-lines, and topography), accompanied by a statement setting forth the nature of all proposed modifications, changes, or supplementations of area and dimensional requirements of the applicable zoning regulations.  The site plan must contain sufficient detail to allow the Development Review Board to assess the relationship of the proposed development to the site's natural features, and compatibility with surrounding lands. 
B. 	All Planned Unit Developments shall be subject to Site Plan Review in accordance with applicable portions of Section 1900 of these Regulations. 
C. 	In determining the number of units which may be developed within the residential portion of a PUD, the Development Review Board shall consider, as an upper limit, the number which could be developed in conformance with the zoning and subdivision regulations for the district in which the project is located.  In making this determination the Development Review Board shall consider only developable land as defined in Article XXI of these Regulations. When determining the size of any area occupied by a slope of 15 percent or more, the Development Review Board shall use the “bare earth” Lidar data compiled by Earthdata International for the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization in 2004, and apply the lidar data at its original grid cell resolution using a methodology calculating the maximum amount of elevation change between each cell and its neighbors.  (The Shelburne Zoning office shall provide applicants with Lidar data and/or slope area calculations based on this approach upon request.) Residential density in PUDs shall be calculated on a gross density basis. 
D. 	Where a district boundary line divides a lot being developed as a PUD, the Development Review Board may allow the development of a single PUD with a total density based on the allowable density of each district. 
E. 	The proposal shall be an effective and unified treatment of the development possibilities on the project site, and the proposed development plan shall make appropriate provision for the preservation of streams and stream banks, steep slopes, wet areas, soils unsuitable for development, forested areas, agricultural land, significant views, and unique, natural and man-made features. 
F. 	The proposal shall be consistent with the Town Comprehensive Plan and all applicable bylaws. 
G.  	The proposal shall be consistent with all evaluation standards set forth in the Shelburne Subdivision Regulations. 
H.  	The proposal shall provide for the appropriate allocation, distribution, preservation and maintenance of open space and/or agricultural and forestry lands. Design that allows for contiguous open space areas is encouraged. 
I. 	The proposed design shall provide for the economy and efficiency of street, utility, and public facility installation, construction and maintenance. 
J. 	Except in the Rural District, proposed PUDs shall be connected to municipal water and sewer service systems, and such systems must be capable of accommodating increased flows due to the proposed development. 
K. 	The development shall be compatible with neighboring properties. 
L. 	The Development Review Board may require phased construction of the development in order to stay consistent with the Town’s desired rate of growth, and in accordance with the Town Plan and any duly adopted Capital Budget and Program. 
M. 	The development may be subject to requirements regarding traffic. 
N. 	In a PUD containing residential development, the dwelling units permitted may, at the discretion of the Development Review Board, be of varied types as allowed in the district in which the PUD is located, and may be located in buildings connected by ground level or elevated covered walkways, or underground tunnels. 
1930.3 	Planned Unit Development-Residential. Planned Unit Developments-Residential (PUD-R) shall contain only residential uses as allowed in the individual districts, and shall be allowed in the Rural District, the Residential District, the Village Center District, the Village Residential District, the Shelburne Falls Mixed Use District, and the Mixed Use District, as specified in Articles III through XVIII.

Except for PUD-Rs in the Rural District, all PUD-Rs shall be connected to the municipal sanitary sewer and the municipal water supply systems. 

6. 	
All PUD-Rs in the Rural District shall comply with the following Open Space requirement: Designated open space within the PUD shall occupy at least 60 percent of the total area of the PUD. 


Design Process for PUD-Rs in the Rural District. In the Rural District, the objective of the PUD-R is to identify and preserve significant visual and natural features found in the area, and which give much of Shelburne its unique character. To achieve this, a pre-application conference with the Development Review Board is required.  At the pre-application conference the applicant must demonstrate the following: 
1. 
That they began the design process by creating a map of the site that shows all such features, as well as land not considered developable per the definition in Article XXI. 

2. 
That starting from this base, potential house sites were then identified that minimize infringement on the identified resources.  The number of house sites will evolve from this 


C. 

analysis, but may not exceed the maximum density set forth in Article III. 
3. That after identifying potential house sites, a potential development plan was created showing lot lines, access, and retained open spaces, consistent with the applicable dimensional requirements. In order to retain a rural character, it is strongly recommended that individual building lots be of varying sizes and shapes. 
The result of the pre-application conference will be the sharing of expectations regarding how the site can be developed in a manner that achieves the objectives of the Rural District.

1. 	
Protect and preserve for future use those important educational, agricultural, natural, cultural and aesthetic resource values evident in large historic places or complexes of buildings which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (“historic places”) and/or large landscapes possessing significant agricultural, natural, visual or aesthetic resource values (“significant landscapes”). 

2. 	
Encourage the adaptive reuse of structures located in or on such historic places or significant landscapes. 

3. 	
Ensure that any new development occurring in or on an historic place or significant landscape is both aesthetically and functionally compatible with the goals of protecting and preserving the resource values identified herein.  


B. 	Qualifiers: For purposes of Section 1930.6, words such as “protect and preserve”, “visually, aesthetically and functionally compatible with” and avoiding “undue adverse impact, aesthetically or otherwise on the significant visual character and resources of the area” shall not be construed to prevent alterations necessary for the adaptive reuse and/or repair of the functional obsolescence of an historic place, the construction of new structures, or to prevent re­grading, replanting or other reconfiguration of significant landscapes; provided, however, that any alteration or addition to an historic place or significant landscape shall be the least such alteration or addition reasonably necessary to permit such historic place or significant landscape to effectively function consistent with an approved master plan.  The master plan for the PUD-RMU required under subsection 1930.6(d) below will serve to define the agreed upon interpretation of broad terms such as those above and will provide the general planning framework and overall criteria for reviewing future proposed new uses. 
C. 	General Requirements. In addition to standards contained in the Shelburne Zoning Bylaws and Subdivision Regulations, the Development Review Board may approve an application for a PUD-RMU only if it finds that each of the following criteria (and the criteria contained in Subsections 5 and 6 hereof, relating to new uses and new or adapted structures) have been met to the Development Review Board’s reasonable satisfaction: 
1. 	
Aesthetics: The PUD-RMU has been designed to be aesthetically compatible with the historic site structures, significant landscape and surrounding lands. 

2. 	
Agricultural, Cultural and Natural Resource Protection:  The PUD-RMU has been designed to protect and preserve agricultural, cultural and natural resources. 

3. 	
Public Benefit:  The PUD-RMU provides a significant public benefit.  A significant public benefit may include protection and enhancement of significant rural landscapes, historic structures and complexes, provision of access to recreational, cultural or educational opportunities, housing, or other economic benefit to the Town without undue adverse impact on infrastructure and services. 

4. 	
Compatibility: The PUD-RMU is compatible with the historic, educational, agricultural, natural, cultural, and aesthetic resource values of the historic place or significant landscape. 

5. 	
New Uses:  Any proposed new uses in the PUD-RMU are consistent with the preservation and protection of the historic place or the significant landscape. 

6. 	
New or Adapted Structures:  Any new or adapted structures in the PUD-RMU will be visually and functionally compatible with existing historic places or significant landscapes. 


D. 	Comprehensive PUD -RMU Long-Term Master Land Use Plan. 
1.

Approval to exceed the 35’ maximum will only be granted if it is demonstrated that the structure is a specifically identified element in the long-term master land use plan for the property and will not have an undue adverse impact, aesthetically or otherwise, on the site, adjacent properties, or public roads or the provision of emergency services.  Farm silos shall be exempt from this provision.  


Uses. In addition to those uses listed as permitted or conditional uses for the district in which the PUD-RMU is located, the Development Review Board may approve other uses if it determines that the identified uses are consistent with the master plan and the standards of this Section .  Subsequent to the PUD­RMU approval, any additional uses or changes in use must be approved by the Development Review Board as a revision to the approved PUD-RMU.  In making such approval or in approving 
H. 

subsequent uses or changes in use, the Development Review Board shall find that the following conditions are satisfied. 
1. 	
The uses shall be integrated into the overall use and 
concept for the historic place or significant landscape. 


2. 	
The uses shall be compatible with other uses in the historic place or significant landscape, and shall not have an undue adverse impact on the visual character of the area comprising the PUD-RMU. 

3. 	
The intensity of use shall not have an undue adverse impact on the agricultural, natural and visual resources of the PUD-RMU. 

4. 	
The uses shall not have an undue adverse impact on lands adjacent to the PUD-RMU. 

5. 	
Traffic generated by the uses on a regular or sustained 
basis shall not create an undue adverse impact on roads 
either internal to or serving the PUD-RMU. 



New Structures. 
1. 	Justification.  Since one of the stated purposes of this Section is to preserve and protect historic places and/or significant landscapes, new structures may be approved by the Development Review Board only if the following conditions are satisfied: 
i. 	The new structure is necessary to support the planned uses of the PUD-RMU and is aesthetically compatible with the historic place or significant landscape. 
ii. 	The new structure is clearly identified in the Plan. 
iii. 	The new structure will house uses approved for the PUD-RMU under Subsection f above. 
iv. 	
The new structure constitutes an integrated element of the Plan. 

v. 	
New structures in the PUD-RMU have been sited and designed in such a way that there is no undue adverse impact on the landscape and its significant visual, agricultural, cultural and natural resources. 


2. 	
HP&DRC Participation in Review. The HP&DRC shall provide assistance to the DRB, upon request from the DRB, in the review of specific development applications. 

3.

1930.7 	Planned Unit Developments-Commercial and Planned Unit Developments—Mixed Use in the Mixed Use District. Planned Unit Developments-Commercial (PUD-C) and Planned Unit Developments—Mixed use (PUD-MU) may be allowed in the Mixed Use District in accordance with the following: 
A. 	Purpose:  The PUDs in the Mixed Use District are intended to encourage high quality design of commercial development that achieves the purposes set forth for this district, and to provide a pleasant entry to the Town of Shelburne. 
B. 	Design Standards: 
1. 	
Buildings and Building location:  The use of multiple buildings is encouraged, and no single building may have a footprint that exceeds the limits established for the district in which the PUD is located. Buildings shall be located in clusters which, in conjunction with landscaping and land form, create pleasant and functional spaces within the site. Buildings connected by a walkway shall be considered separate buildings.  

2. 	
Road Access:  Direct access from Shelburne road shall be minimized.  A PUD-C or PUD-MU which has frontage on a cross road shall be required to use the cross road for access and no curb cut on Shelburne Road shall be allowed. A PUD-C or PUD-MU which does not have frontage on a cross road, and which has no more than 300 feet of frontage on Shelburne Road, may have one curb cut (no more than three lanes) on Shelburne Road.  A PUD-C or PUD-MU which does not have frontage on a cross road, and which has between 300 and 1,000 feet of frontage on Shelburne Road, may have no more than two curb cuts (each no more than three lanes) on Shelburne Road. A PUD-C or PUD­MU which does not have frontage on a cross road, and which has more than 1,000 feet of frontage on Shelburne 


3. 
4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 


Road, may have no more than three curb cuts (each no more than three lanes) on Shelburne Road. For the purpose of this section, a cross road is any preexisting public road, private road, or right-of-way intersecting with Shelburne Road and having a right-of-way width of at least 40 feet. Access to adjacent lots: Access between lots in a PUD-C shall be encouraged, thus allowing shared use of parking as well as travel between lots without the need to re-enter Shelburne Road.  Connections between lots in the PUD-C shall be located to readily serve parking areas.  Connections to adjacent residential areas shall be designed to discourage through traffic. 
Parking:  Parking shall be encouraged to be located behind or beside buildings, but not in front of buildings. Parking in front of buildings shall not be in the perimeter buffer. Parking shall be designed to serve the entire development and not be assigned to specific buildings.  The Development Review Board may reduce the number of spaces required if a careful analysis of shared parking justifies such reduction.  Parking areas shall be divided by appropriate islands and/or landscaping so that no double or single banked bay of parking contains more than 20 spaces. Landscaping:  The PUD application shall contain a written statement of the goals and objectives of the landscaping and a discussion of how the landscape plan addresses those goals and objectives.  At a minimum, landscaping shall be used to create attractive front yards, augment the visual appearance of buildings, create and reinforce views, define spaces internal to the site, and separate pedestrian from vehicular areas. At least one curbed, landscaped island shall be provided for every twenty parking spaces, and may be located at the end of a parking aisle or internal to the parking area. Pedestrian access:  Convenient and pleasant pedestrian access shall be provided from the sidewalks along Shelburne Road to building entries, from parking areas to building entries, and between buildings.  In addition, connections between the proposed development site and adjacent commercial and residential areas shall be designed to encourage, and provide a pleasant environment for, pedestrian and bicycle travelers. Building design:  Buildings shall be designed to be consistent with the purpose of the Mixed Use District, to create visual interest, and to generate a sense of human scale.  Fenestration, varied roof lines, and other architectural treatments shall be used to break up blank facades. Facades facing streets or parking areas shall be designed to incorporate glass in the form of windows or window-like features in a significant portion of their façade area (including entries). A significant portion of the buildings’ total foundation perimeter shall be treated with plants and shrubs.

Minimum total area of development: 40,000 square feet in the PUD-RDV, whether in a single lot or a combination of contiguous lots held in common ownership on August 29, 2006, and remaining so on the date of application for approval. However, the owner as of date of application need not be the same as the owner as of August 29, 2006.  Land located within private utility or access easements may be included in the minimum total area. 

2. 	
Minimum lot frontage:   


a. 	
PUD-RDV less than 120,000 square feet: 100’.  This lot frontage requirement may be met by totaling the frontage of all lots within the PUD-RDV that are contiguous to public roads or highways. 

b. 	
PUD-RDV of 120,000 square feet or more:  Such PUD-RDVs shall be exempt from lot frontage requirements. 


3. 	
Minimum front setbacks of the development: The lesser of 10’ or the existing setback of any Existing Structure that is not an Accessory Structure as defined in Section 2110.2 of 

these Bylaws. 

4. 	
Minimum side and rear yards of the development: The lesser of 7.5’ or the existing setback of any Existing Structure that is not an Accessory Structure as defined in Section 2110.2 of these Bylaws. 

5. 	
Treatment of Accessory Structures: Existing Accessory Structures within the setback required under subsections (3) and (4) above, may be retained as a part of the PUD-RDV; however, said structures shall not be used for a use other than accessory use or altered in any manner that increases any exterior dimension of the structure. 

6. 	
Maximum total building coverage: The greater of 35% or the percentage of building coverage of Existing Structures.  The Development Review Board may allow a maximum building coverage of up to 40% to achieve the purposes of the PUD-RDV, especially those that pertain to building design and placement.  The denominator in this calculation shall include land located within private utility and access easements. 

7. 	
Maximum lot coverage: 80 percent. 

8. 	
Maximum building and eave height of the building being replaced within 15 feet of any property boundary shall be 30 feet, with no more than 20 feet to eave height or, except as to Existing Structures, the maximum building and eave height may extend to the existing building height and eave height of the building being replaced. Maximum building height on portions of a lot more than 15 feet from any property boundary shall be 35 feet or, except as to Existing Structures, the maximum building height may extend to the height of the existing building being replaced. 


E. 	Uses: 
1. 	
Permitted uses as set forth in Section 810 of these regulations. 

2. 	
Conditional uses as set forth in Section 820 of these regulations. 

3. 	
Any combination of such Permitted or Conditional uses. 

4. 	
All uses within the PUD-RDV shall be deemed conditional uses and shall be initially reviewed and approved as such by the Development Review Board under Section 1910 of these Bylaws. 


F. 	Development Density 
1 	Allowable nonresidential density: 1,000 square feet of lot area shall be allocated for each 1,000 square feet of floor area for nonresidential use. 
2 	Allowable residential density:  5,000 square feet of lot area shall be allocated for each dwelling unit. 
3 	The maximum residential development density in a PUD­RDV proposing both nonresidential and residential use will be calculated by subtracting the total square footage of floor area allocated for nonresidential purposes from the total square footage of lot area. The remaining lot area will then be divided by 5,000 square feet to determine the maximum number of dwelling units (rounded down). 
For example, if a lot contains 50,000 square feet of area, and 8,000 square feet is allocated for nonresidential uses, the lot area available for calculating the maximum residential density is 42,000 square feet (50,000 minus 8,000).  Then, 42,000 divided by 5,000 produces 8.4.  The maximum residential development density is thus 8 dwelling units. 
G. 	Parking. The Development Review Board may decrease the number of parking spaces required under Section 1960 of these Bylaws by up to 50% as part of site plan review and approval, provided that the applicant can demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that a reduced number of spaces will be adequate or that parking is available, and can be shared outside the PUD-RDV but within 500 feet of the boundary of the PUD-RDV.

AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND THE SEWER CAPACITY ALLOCATION ORDINANCE
ADOPTED May 8, 2007
The Town of Shelburne Selectboard hereby ordains:
The Town of Shelburne Sewer Capacity Allocation Ordinance, adopted February 13, 2001, is hereby amended in its entirety to state:
SEWER CAPACITY ALLOCATION ORDINANCE
Section 1: Authority
This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the authority of 24 V.S.A.
§ 3625 to authorize the Town to allocate the capacity of municipal sewage treatment facilities in the Town, to establish a Capacity Waiting List when capacity is unavailable, and to define the status of allocations of capacity which pre-date the adoption of this Ordinance.
Section 2: Purpose
The Town of Shelburne (“Town”) has made a significant public investment in improvements and increased capacity to the Town’s sewage treatment and disposal facilities (“Plants”) and sewage collection and transmission system (“Sewers”) in order to avoid the environmental damage and danger to the public health caused by limited or inadequate collection and treatment of wastewater. This sewer allocation ordinance is adopted to ensure that the allocation of sewer capacity occurs in a manner which is consistent with the Town Plan, Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Bylaws, to sustain the available capacity over the projected life of the Plants and to protect the public investment in the Plants and Sewers. The Town recognizes that the extension of sewer lines in a dispersed and unplanned pattern creates an additional burden on the Town to maintain the Sewers and Plants, creates an additional financial burden on the Town and its citizens and reduces capacity by increasing inflow and infiltration. This ordinance will serve to direct growth to areas most appropriate for the efficient provision of municipal sewer service.
Section 3: Definitions
The following words will have the meanings below when used in this ordinance:
(a) “Actual Flows” - The volume of wastewater discharged into the Sewers by any single connection to the Sewers
- 2 -
during any specified period of time, measured in gallons.
(b) “Allocation” - The decision by the Board to commit a specified amount of sewage treatment capacity (measured in gallons per day or gpd) to a specific project. An allocation may or may not include allocation phasing.
(c) “Allocation Fee” - A fee for the allocation of sewage treatment capacity, specified as dollars per gpd, as established by the Board.
(d) “Allocation Phasing” - A provision included as part of an allocation to a specific development which specifies the amount of the total allocation which may be used each year.

(f) “Board” - Shall mean the Selectboard of the Town of Shelburne acting as a board of sewage disposal commissioners under 24 V.S.A., § 3614.
(g) “Capacity Waiting List”- The list of applications created when a Three Year Capacity Allocation has been fully distributed.
(h) “Committed Reserve Capacity” -The total amount of development wastewater flow (gallons per day) from all projects/buildings approved by the Board for discharge to the treatment Plant, but not yet discharging at the time of the calculation.
(i) “Development” - The construction of improvements on a tract of land for any purpose, including, but not limited to, residential, commercial and industrial activity.
(j) “Development Wastewater Flow” - The flow resulting from full use of the development at its peak capacity, which flow shall be calculated using flow quantities, as promulgated at the time an allocation application is made. Flow quantities shall be those established under the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation’s Environmental Protection Rules. For uses which are not specified in the Environmental Protection Rules a flow quantity shall be established by the Department of
- 3 -
Environmental Conservation (Department).
(k) “Discharge Permit” - Shall mean a permit issued by the Department pursuant to authority granted in 10 V.S.A., Chapter 47.
(l) “Nonresidential” - Any use, or portion of a mixed use project, other than residential and shall include both profit and not for profit businesses and institutions.
(m) “Permitted Wastewater Flow” - The maximum Plant wastewater flow authorized in the Discharge Permit on an annual average (365 day average) basis.
(n) “Person” - Shall have the meaning prescribed in 10 V.S.A., §6001(14).

A residential unit shall contain kitchen and bath facilities. Units, such as dormitories or nursing home facilities, without these facilities shall be considered nonresidential.
(s) “Sanitary Wastewater” - Wastewater of the same character and range of strength as expected from homes.
(t) “Sewer Service Area” - That area designated on the attached plan, titled “Town of Shelburne, Map of Sewer Service Area,” prepared by Civil Engineering Associates, dated January, 2001.
(u) “Sketch Plan Allocation” - An allocation approval which is granted by the Board after a project has received
- 4 -
subdivision sketch plan approval from the Planning Commission.
(v) “Uncommitted Reserve Capacity” - That portion of the reserve capacity remaining after subtracting the development wastewater flow of all projects approved by the Board but not yet discharging to the sewer.
Section 4: Discharge Permit and Reserve Capacity
a). Discharge Permit
The Town of Shelburne has a certain amount of uncommitted
reserve capacity at the two Plants located in and owned by
the Town, as defined in 24 V.S.A. § 3501(6) and 3601(3). The
Plants and Sewers were upgraded and expanded based on a
report entitled “Facilities Planning Report for Wastewater
Pollution Control and Plant Expansion”, prepared by
Webster-Martin, Inc., dated October, 1996. The Plants are
operated in accord with a discharge permit, as amended,
issued by the Vermont Department of Environmental
Conservation (“Department”) under authority granted in 10
V.S.A., Chapter 47. The Town of Shelburne Selectboard shall
serve as the board of sewage disposal commissioners
(“Board”) and is obligated by law to comply with
conditions of that permit, and to operate and manage the
Sewers and Plants as governmental functions under and
pursuant to 24 V.S.A., Chapters 97 and 101.
b). Control of Capacity
The capacity of the Plants is the property of the Town. The
projected life span of the Plants is twenty (20) years
from 2001, the date that the upgrade and expansion,
as described in Section 4, a, above, is deemed to be available
for allocation. The uncommitted reserve capacity of the
Plants shall be allocated over the life of the system by the
Board in the manner described below. This ordinance is
adopted pursuant to the provisions of 24 V.S.A § 3625, in
the manner provided in Town of Shelburne Charter and shall
not be construed as an abandonment or relinquishment of the
authority or responsibility of the Board to regulate,
control and supervise all means and methods of sewage
collection, treatment and disposal within the Town, nor
shall it be construed to impair or inhibit the ability of
the Town to contract with persons for the collection,
transmission and treatment of sewage.
c) Allocation of Capacity
- 5 -
Recognizing that the load on the Plants and Sewers must be
controlled, that there is insufficient capacity to service
the entire Town, that uncontrolled assignment of capacity
will reduce the projected lifespan of the Plants and that it
is necessary to maintain a balance of residential and
nonresidential uses, the Board shall allocate pursuant to
this Ordinance the uncommitted reserve capacity by type of
use and at a rate as specified below.
Section 5: Sewer Service Area
No capacity shall be allocated outside the sewer service area, except as specified below:
a) Rural Mixed Use Planned Unit Development
A project which has received Planning Commission sketch plan
approval as a Rural Mixed Use Planned Unit Development may
be granted capacity regardless of location within or outside
of the sewer service area.
b) Failed Systems
In the event that any existing waste water treatment system
fails, within or outside of the sewer service area, the
Board may make an emergency allocation to alleviate the
problem provided that the following conditions are met:
(1) The failure has created a public health hazard as defined in 18 V.S.A. § 2, or has the potential for
causing substantial environmental harm;
(2) All other possible solutions have been explored and found inadequate; and
(3) There will be no additional connections to any sewer line extensions needed to solve the problem.
c) Additional Allocation
Any structure located outside of the sewer service area,
which is connected to the Sewers as of the effective date of
this ordinance, may be granted additional allocation, under
the same terms and conditions of this ordinance, provided
that the additional allocation is used solely for the
connected structure and that the Sewers are not extended
beyond the connected structure. The additional allocation
shall not exceed fifty per cent (50%) of the existing
allocation to the structure as of May 22, 2001.
Section 6: Reserve Capacity Allocation
- 6 -
The Board shall have the authority to set the Three Year Capacity
Allocation for each Plant as set forth below. This allocation
may be amended during the three year period as deemed
appropriate by the Board.
a) Determining Allocation
Application shall be made, using a form provided for that
purpose by the Town, for the number of gallons per day
of estimated sewer usage determined by applying the standard
factors specified by the Public Facilities Division of the
Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, or its successor, as
amended from time to time. Industrial projects and others
not covered by those standard factors will be allocated a
reasonable number of gallons, as determined by the Board,
consistent with the Environmental Protection Rules
established by the Vermont Department of Environmental
Conservation. The amount requested may be amended by the
applicant prior to final action by the Board, or by the
Board in connection with its final approval.
b) Ten Percent (10%) Set Aside Amount
Upon adoption of this ordinance the Board shall establish a
set aside amount of capacity. This amount shall be
calculated based on the uncommitted reserve capacity at the
Plants, less the estimated capacity required for categories
not subject to the Three Year Capacity Allocation, times ten
percent (10%).This set aside amount shall be available in
any Three Year Capacity Allocation period for allocation by
the Board to applications which have been deemed by the
Planning Commission to demonstrate exceptional design or to
provide affordable housing or public amenities and which
advance the objectives of the Town of Shelburne
Comprehensive Plan. This set aside amount shall only be
allocated as specified in Section 7: b) (2) below.
c) Determination of Three Year Capacity Allocation and
Assignment to Allocation Categories
The Board shall determine the remaining Capacity to be
allocated within the Three Year Capacity Allocation by 1)
subtracting the Plant Wastewater Flow (obtained from the
latest State Department of Environmental Conservation
Uncommitted Reserve Hydraulic Capacity Report), from the
Permitted Wastewater Flow, 2) subtracting the Committed
Reserve (obtained from the same report), 3) less an
estimate of the capacity needed for categories not subject
to the Three Year Capacity Allocation and 4), less the Ten
Percent Set Aside, divided by the remaining number of years
in the twenty (20) year Plant life spans, and multiply the
result by three. The Board may consider anticipated
- 7 -
future demand for allocation when establishing the Three
Year Capacity Allocation. The Board shall establish a Three
Year Capacity Allocation amount which accommodates demand as
much as possible, but which also preserves capacity for
future years of the projected Plant life.
d) Three Year Capacity Allocation
The Three Year Capacity Allocation shall be set forth in a
document entitled “Attachment B: Three Year Sewage
Treatment Capacity Allocation From May 8, 2007 to May 8,
2010.”Attachment B shall be adopted as if it were an
ordinance in accordance with the Town of Shelburne Charter.
e) Attachment A
Categories Not Subject to Three Year Capacity Allocation are
defined and the amount of allocation estimated for each is
contained in Attachment A.
f) Distribution of Three Year Capacity Allocation
(1) Residential Allocations: In each allocation period eighty per cent (80%) of the Three Year Capacity Allocation shall be distributed to residential uses.
(2) Nonresidential Allocations: In each allocation period 20% of the Three Year Capacity Allocation shall be distributed to nonresidential uses.
Section 7: Allocation Procedures
a) Timing of Applications
The Board shall act on all applications on a first come,
first served basis as soon as practical.
(1) Application Eligibility: No applications for
individual project allocations shall be considered
by the Board unless the project has first received
sketch plan approval, pursuant to the Town's
Subdivision Regulations, is located on a lot in
preexisting or approved residential or
commercial/industrial subdivision or has received
conditional use approval or site plan approval, as
appropriate, in accordance with the Town's Zoning
Bylaws.
- 8 -
(2) Sketch Plan Approval: A project which has received
subdivision sketch plan approval by the Planning
Commission may be granted a one year Sketch Plan
Allocation by the Board.
(3) Application: Sewer allocation applications (on
forms provided by the Board) shall be completed
and returned to the Office of the Town Manager.
The application shall be accompanied by an
application fee established by the Board.
b) Priority of Applications
If the application is filed with the Office of the Town
Manager within thirty (30) days after the granting of
conditional use, site plan or sketch plan approval, its
priority vis-à-vis other applications shall be determined by
the date of said approval; otherwise, its priority shall be
determined by the date of filing with the Town Manager.
c) Phasing
(1). Exceeding the Three Year Capacity: If the
allocation required for a project exceeds
the amount remaining in a three year period the
Board may grant the remaining capacity available
in that Three Year Capacity Allocation and
capacity from future years’ Three Year Capacity
Allocation in order to allocate the total gallons
needed for that application. In determining such
an allocation schedule the Board shall consider
any phasing schedule imposed as a condition of
Planning Commission approval. Any application
which receives a phased allocation shall not
connect to the Sewers until the beginning of the
designated Three Year Capacity Allocation period.
(2) Maximum Allocation: No more than forty percent
(40%) of any Three Year Capacity Allocation, for
either residential or nonresidential allocation,
as appropriate, may be granted to a single person
or project. If allocation remains in a Three Year
Capacity Allocation block at the time that the
forty percent (40%) cap is imposed on an
application, the application may be phased by
granting the remaining allocation needed from
future years’ Three Year Capacity Allocation under
the same conditions as specified in Section
7: d) (2) below.
- 9 -
d) Insufficient Three Year Capacity Allocation
(1) Full Distribution: If a Three Year Capacity
Allocation block has been fully distributed, no
additional allocations shall be granted throughout
the remainder of that period, except as allowed in
Section 7: d) (2) below. If the remainder of a
Three Year Capacity Allocation block is less than
a complete unit of Development Wastewater Flow (a
bedroom, employee, etc, as appropriate), the Three
Year Capacity Allocation block shall be considered
fully distributed.
(2) Use of 10% Set Aside: If a Three Year Capacity
Allocation block has been fully distributed the
Board may grant an allocation from the Ten Percent
Set Aside Amount to applications which meet the
standards as specified in Section 6: b), above.
Section 8 Expiration of Allocations
a) Subdivisions or PUDs/PRDs
Allocations approved after Sketch Plan shall expire
one (1) years from the date of Board approval unless the
Board grants a one (1) year renewal. The Board, upon
determination that the project is still active in any state
or local application process, may grant additional one (1)
year renewals. A request for any one (1) year renewal must
be made to the Town Manager prior to the expiration of any
Sketch Plan approval or prior renewal.
b) Allocations Approved After Final Approval
Unless infrastructure sufficient for a connection to the
sewers has been constructed, allocations shall expire three
3) years from the date of Board approval.
c) Multiple Use or Lots
Where allocation was granted for multiple uses or lots,
allocation shall expire for any such use or lot
not connected to the Sewer within three (3) years of the
allocation date.
d) Phased Allocations
For phased allocations, a connection for each approved unit must be made to the Sewer within three(3) years of the date on which allocation becomes available to a use or lot or
that allocation shall expire.
- 10 -
e) Extensions
The Board shall grant extensions of up to three
(3) years to any allocation, other than one granted after
Sketch Plan approval, if an application is received by the
Office of the Town Manager prior to the expiration date of
the original allocation. Such extensions shall be approved
by the Board upon determination that the project is still
active in any applicable permit process.
f) Reversion of Allocation
Reserve capacity is allocated by the Board to a specific
project on a specific parcel of land. After completion of
the project, or upon expiration of necessary permits issued
under the Town’s Zoning or Subdivision regulations, the
unused allocation (adjusted to the actual development
constructed, if necessary), will revert to the Town.
Section 9: Assignability of Allocations
a) Use of Allocations
Allocations of capacity and places on a waiting list under
this Ordinance may not be:
(1) Sold or transferred for use on property other than
that for which the allocation was originally
granted; or
(2) Used for substantially different improvements of
the same property, whether or not owned by the
original applicant.
b) Undistributed Three Year Capacity Allocation
Any residential or nonresidential allocation which is
undistributed during a Three Year Capacity Allocation period
shall be returned to the Uncommitted Reserve Capacity
calculation for the Plants.
Section 10: Approval, Findings, Conditions and Connection Authorization
a) Findings
Upon receipt of the sewer allocation application and
supporting documents, the Board may grant approval of an
allocation from the Three Year Capacity Allocation, upon
making affirmative findings that:
- 11 -
(1) Compliance: The proposed use of wastewater
capacity complies with the standards set forth in
this Ordinance and is not in conflict with any
other ordinances duly adopted by the Selectboard
of the Town of Shelburne, and Subsections 2
below.
(2) Wastewater Origin: The proposed wastewater is of
domestic, sanitary origin and that there is
sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity to
accommodate the volume and strength of the
proposed connection; or
The proposed wastewater is not of domestic
sanitary origin and that sufficient evidence has
been presented by the applicant to demonstrate
that the flow and character of the wastewater is
compatible with the proper operation of the Plants
and Sewers and that the proposed wastewater will
not alone or in combination with other wastes
cause a violation of the discharge permit, pass
through the Plants without treatment, interfere or
otherwise disrupt the proper quality and disposal
of Plant sludge or be injurious in any other
manner to the Plants or Sewers and that there is
sufficient uncommitted reserve capacity to
accommodate the strength and volume of the
proposed development.
b) Approval and Conditions
The Board, after making the approval findings above, may
grant approval of an allocation from the Three Year Capacity
Allocation. The approval shall be a binding commitment of
capacity to the project contingent on compliance with any
conditions attached to the approval. The Board may revoke
the allocation approval upon finding that the applicant
failed to meet any of the conditions attached to the
attached approval. The Board may attach additional
conditions deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the
intent of this ordinance and for purposes of implementing
the goals and policies of the Town's Comprehensive Plan.
Section 11: Capacity Waiting List
a) Three Year Capacity Allocation Waiting List
Once a Three Year Capacity Allocation has been fully
distributed any subsequent applications for allocation within
that period shall be placed on a waiting list. Applications

If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section 4 of this Article, and which in the judgment of the Commission may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Commission may:
a. Reject the wastes
b. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
c. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
d. Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of Section 10 of this Article.
If the Commission permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the Commission and to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
Sec. 6. Grease, oil, hair, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Commission, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Commission, and shall be so located as to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Materials collected shall not be reintroduced into the sewage works.

Sec. 8. When required by the Commission, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Commission. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
Sec. 9. All measurements, test and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect to constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (the particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hr composite of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples).
Sec. 10. No statement contained in this Article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Commission and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Commission for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern.

In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately-owned infrastructure within or adjacent to a Watercourse, so that such structures will not adversely impact the use, function, or physical integrity of the Watercourse. Natural riparian buffers and manmade Watercourses established as part of a development and required by Town regulations shall be maintained by the developer and all other subsequent property owners, including but not limited to associations, within the development.
ARTICLE III - STORMWATER SYSTEM USER FEES
3.1 Establishment of Stormwater User Fees
(A) A user fee based on an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) shall be imposed on every owner of Developed Property within the Town. An ERU shall equal that square footage that represents the median of the area of Impervious Surface for all Single-Family Residences in the Town. The Selectboard shall, by resolution, establish the square footage that constitutes one ERU on a periodic basis.
(B) The Selectboard shall have the authority to set and modify the user fee rates so that the total revenue generated by said charges, and any secondary sources of revenue, shall be sufficient to fund the Town’s stormwater program.
(C) The Selectboard shall establish by resolution the monthly rate for each ERU. The monthly user fee for a specific property is determined by multiplying the rate per ERU times the number of ERUs allocated to the property.
(D) There are no exempt properties under this Article.
3.2 User Fee Credits:
(A) The Stormwater Superintendent shall prepare for the Selectboard’s approval, a “Credit Manual for Stormwater Fees” specifying the design and performance standards of on-site Private Stormwater Systems, facilities, activities and services which qualify for application of a user fee credit and the method of calculating Credits. The Selectboard shall have the authority to approve, modify and approve or disapprove the Credit Manual.
ORDINANCE REGULATING THE USE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STORMWATER SYSTEMS
Town of Shelburne Stormwater Ordinance
12
(B) Following approval of a Credit Manual, the Stormwater Superintendent may, at the request of a property owner, reduce the user fee established for any property by awarding a Credit based on the policies and conditions set forth in the Manual. No Credit shall exceed seventy-five percent (75%) of the applicable monthly user fee for a given property. Any property owner may appeal the Stormwater Superintendent’s determination regarding an award of a Credit by filing a written notice of appeal with the Stormwater Appeal Board within ten (10) business days of the Stormwater Superintendent’s decision. The Stormwater Appeal Board shall review such appeal at a meeting preceded by fifteen (15) calendar days written notice of the meeting date to the property owner. Following the meeting, the Stormwater Appeal Board shall issue its decision on the appeal in writing, which decision shall be final.
(C) Credits shall be applied to user fees on the next billing period after the completed credit application is approved.
(D) Any award of Credit shall be conditioned on continuing compliance with the Town’s design and performance standards as stated in the “Credit Manual for Stormwater Fees” and/or upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the Credit is based. The Stormwater Superintendent may revoke or reduce a Credit at any time for non-compliance by providing thirty (30) days written notice of a non-complying condition and intent to revoke or reduce the Credit to the property owner. If the non-compliance is not cured within the thirty (30) day period, the Stormwater Superintendent shall eliminate the Credit for user fee bills issued to the property owner after such period. A property owner may appeal the Stormwater Superintendent’s determination regarding Credit revocation or reduction in the same manner set forth in paragraph (B), above.
3.3 Establishment of ERUs:
(A) Each Single-Family Residence (SFR) with less than one acre of Impervious Surface shall be allocated one (1) ERU. Each Single-Family Residence (SFR) with equal to or more than one acre of Impervious Surface shall be allocated ten (10) ERUs.
(B) The ERUs allocated to NSFR properties, except Town highways, shall be determined in the following manner:
(1) The amount of Impervious Surface on each Parcel shall be divided by the gross area of the Parcel resulting in the percent of imperviousness for the Parcel.
(2) Based on the percent of Impervious Surface, a “tier factor” shall be determined, based on the following categories:
ORDINANCE REGULATING THE USE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STORMWATER SYSTEMS
Town of Shelburne Stormwater Ordinance
13
*Fee will be based on actual amount of Impervious Surface, measured in square feet. The tier factor used shall be the percent impervious area of the Parcel represented as a decimal (e.g. 1.5% would be 0.015, 6.9% would be 0.069, 10.3% would be 0.103, etc). The gross area of the Parcel shall be multiplied by the tier factor, and then divided by the ERU. The resulting value is rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is the number of ERUs for the property.
(C) The ERUs allocated to properties comprised solely of Town owned roadways shall be determined by dividing two-thirds of the total Impervious Surface for the property by the ERU. The resulting value is then rounded up to the nearest whole number which is the number of ERUs for the property.
3.4 Billing and Collection
(A) Stormwater user fees will be billed quarterly and shall be reflected on the water and sewer bills for each property owner, where applicable. The bill shall also state the ERUs allocated to each property.
(B) Stormwater user fees will be phased in over a three-year period, such that in the first year (fiscal year 2021-2022), fees billed will be 33% of what would otherwise be the full billable rate; in the second year (fiscal year 2022-2023), fees billed will be 66% of what would otherwise be the full billable

rate; and in the third year (fiscal year 2023-2024) and beyond, fees billed will be at the full billable rate (100%). This phased approach is a Townwide master billing approach for all properties subject to this Ordinance and existing as of the date of adoption of this Ordinance. Any property developed after that date will be billed user fees based on that master billing cycle. All user fees will be net of any credits earned and accepted per the Town’s Credit Manual.
(C) A property owner may appeal an allocation of ERUs to the Stormwater Superintendent by submitting a written notice of appeal to the Stormwater Superintendent within fifteen (15) calendar days of the mailing date of the bill. The Stormwater Superintendent shall promptly meet with the property owner and issue a decision of the allocation of ERUs. A property owner may appeal the Stormwater Superintendent’s determination regarding Credit revocation in the same manner set forth in Section 3.3(B). The filing of an appeal shall not relieve a property owner of the obligation to pay the user fee when due.
(D) In the event any stormwater user fee is not paid within thirty (30) days from the billing date, a late penalty charge will be added to the fee together with interest charges. The amount of the late penalty charge and the interest rate on the overdue accounts shall be the same as those applied to delinquent taxes. If such payment is not made, such stormwater user fee shall be a lien upon such real estate and may be collected in the manner provided in 24 V.S.A. §§ 3504 and 3612. Any payment made to the Town for utility fees shall first be allocated to delinquent water, then delinquent sewer, then delinquent stormwater fees. The remaining amount of the payment shall first be allocated to current water, then current sewer, then current stormwater fees.
3.5 Expenditures.
(A) The user fees, as well as any secondary sources of revenue, shall be used to fund the Town’s efforts to manage Stormwater. Acceptable expenditures include, but are not limited to, capital construction, maintenance and operations, engineering and planning, regulation and enforcement, water quality programs, special services, administration and management, coverage requirements, reserve funds, staff or labor costs, vehicle and equipment purchases, water quality related public education, and miscellaneous overhead costs.
(B) Excess revenues may be placed into a sinking fund, and may be retained and expended pursuant to 24 V.S.A. § 3616. The Town reserves the right to increase, decrease, stop and/or maintain regular deposits into a sinking fund not exceeding 15% of the normal total budgeted expenses for maintenance/replacement in that year. The Selectboard holding office shall have the authority to withdraw sinking fund amounts only for the purposes of paying acceptable expenditures as outlined in Section 3.5(A), above.

ARTICLE V – MUNICIPAL COST SHARING
5.1 Purpose
The Purpose of this article is to establish a Town policy regarding cost sharing of upgrading or improving Stormwater Treatment Practices on private property that are required by the MS4 Permit, Flow Restoration Plans (FRPs), Phosphorus Control Plans (PCPs) or any other future MS4 permit requirement.
5.2 Applicability
(A) This section shall apply to stormwater system upgrades or improvements as required by Article IV of this document.
5.3 Municipal Share of Stormwater Project Costs
(A) The Town shall share in the cost of upgrading or improving Stormwater Treatment Practices (STPs) that are required by the MS4 Permit, Flow Restoration Plans (FRPs), and/or Phosphorus Control Plans (PCPs) as follows:
(1) The Town shall contribute funds from the stormwater utility budget for the construction of upgrades or improvements to STPs on a pro rata basis. Cost sharing shall be determined by the percentage of Impervious Surface area that is publicly owned and covered by the existing Stormwater permit as compared to the total Impervious Surface area covered by the existing Stormwater permit;
(a) Areas outside of the existing Stormwater permit that drain to the STP will not be included in this calculation unless the additional off-site area is routed to the STP as part of the upgrade or improvement. If offsite areas are being redirected to the STP as part of the upgrade or improvement, then these areas will be included as part of the Town’s Impervious Surface area in the cost sharing calculation.
(2) The Town’s share of funding for upgrades or improvement of any particular STP will be determined on a schedule established by and at the discretion of the Town. The Town will update this schedule on an annual basis, as needed, to ensure that expenditures are budgeted in a way that is sustainable for both the Stormwater utility sinking fund and Stormwater utility rate payers, and to permit the required objectives.
(3) The Town will cost share in the upgrade or improvement of an STP to the minimum design requirements that achieve the Stormwater treatment necessary to satisfy FRPs and the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual (VSMM). Work included as part of any upgrade or improvement
ORDINANCE REGULATING THE USE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STORMWATER SYSTEMS
Town of Shelburne Stormwater Ordinance
21
that is beyond the minimum necessary to meet the minimum design requirements will be the responsibility of the Owner of the Regulated Private System. The Town will not share in the cost of any work undertaken that is not directly related to the STP.
(4) The Town shall review and will share in the costs of any change orders during construction until the total of change order requests exceeds 10% of the estimated total project cost. Change order requests seeking cost increases beyond 10% of the estimated total project cost will be borne by the Owner of the Regulated Private System, unless otherwise agreed to by the Town in the Stormwater Superintendent’s sole and complete discretion.
(5) The Town shall not contribute funds for engineering or design services incurred as part of upgrades or improvements to STPs unless:
(a) The Town obtains grant or other outside funding for the engineering or design project and a signed Stormwater system improvement agreement with the Owner of the Regulated Private System that addresses engineering or design cost sharing is in place;
(b) The Town will not be responsible for engineering or design costs that were incurred prior to the effective date of a Stormwater system improvement agreement for the upgrade or improvement to the STP.
(6) The Town will provide its pro rata share of STP upgrade or improvement costs only after the Stormwater Superintendent or his designee has inspected the Stormwater treatment system and the STP upgrade or improvement and certified that it has been constructed in accordance with the previously approved project plans.
(7) The Town is not required to obtain grants or other outside funding for any individual project. Grants will be obtained at the discretion of the Stormwater Superintendent based on staff availability and other factors.
(8) If a grant or outside funding is obtained by the Town for a STP upgrade or improvement project, such grant or outside funding will first be applied to offset the Town’s pro rata share of the STP upgrade or improvement costs. Any amount in exceedance of the Town’s pro rata share may be applied to the Regulated Private System Owner’s pro rata share of the STP upgrade or improvement project costs at the discretion of the Stormwater Superintendent.
(9) STP upgrade or improvement projects that are eligible for Town cost sharing must follow the process outlined for inclusion of the Stormwater treatment system under the Town’s MS4 Permit as established in Article IV of this Ordinance.
(a) If a Regulated Private System Owner performs an upgrade or improvement to an STP, but does not intend to obtain coverage under the MS4 Permit and instead obtains permit coverage
ORDINANCE REGULATING THE USE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STORMWATER SYSTEMS
Town of Shelburne Stormwater Ordinance
22
directly from the State of Vermont, they may still obtain cost sharing from the Town pursuant the requirements of this Article. In order to be eligible, these projects must:
(i) Submit engineering and design plans for STP upgrade or improvement to the Stormwater Superintendent and obtain written approval of these plans prior to incurring any costs that would be eligible for cost sharing; and
(ii) Sign a Stormwater system improvement agreement with the Town that establishes pro rata cost sharing for all parties involved; and
(iii) Obtain the Stormwater Superintendent’s written confirmation that the STP upgrade or improvement was constructed in conformance with the approved plans once construction is complete.
ARTICLE VI - INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT
6.1 Power and Authority of Inspectors
(A) Any Authorized Person bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties subject to regulation under this Ordinance for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.

ARTICLE XXII. SHELBURNE ROAD FORM-BASED OVERLAY DISTRICT (SR-FBOD) 

2200 	GENERAL 
2200.1 	Purpose and Intent 
2200.1A 	Purpose. The purpose of the Shelburne Road Form-Based Overlay District (SR-FBOD) is to provide a set of zoning regulations that place greater emphasis on the building design and site layout, and less emphasis on the types of land uses within those buildings with the goal of facilitating sustainable development in selected areas of Shelburne. These qualities will be achieved through implementation of context-based building forms, active open spaces and streetscapes, and complete streets collectively designed to be integrated, connected and complementary. 
2200.1B 	Intent. The intent is to meet the goals of the 2019 Town of Shelburne Comprehensive Plan and other strategic area plans endorsed by the town. The SR-FBOD, which extends along the corridor from the boundary shared with South Burlington to the LaPlatte River, is illustrated on the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B). 

2200.2 	Applicability 
2200.2A 	Where Applicable. This article applies to all property in the SR-FBOD as shown on the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B) and the Zoning Overlay Districts Map. 
2200.2B 	When Applicable. An applicant may request that proposed development in the SR-FBOD be reviewed under the provisions of this article, which will modify the requirements of the underlying zoning districts and other applicable sections of the zoning bylaw. 
2200.2C 	Precedence. Upon an applicant requesting review under the provisions of this article, the provisions of this article will control and will supersede any con.icting provisions contained in the zoning bylaw. 
2200.2D 	Subsequent Development. Upon approval of an application under the provisions of this article, subsequent development on that property will be subject to this article. If this article is discontinued or replaced, it will be subject to any successive zoning district to which form-based zoning requirements are transferred and in which the subject property is located. 
2200.2E 	Previously Issued Approvals. Zoning permits and other approvals under the zoning bylaw obtained before the effective date of this article will remain in effect according to the terms speci.ed in Section 2040. 
2200.2F 	Adult Entertainment Uses. The provisions and requirements of the SR-FBOD shall be superseded by the provisions and requirements of Section 1910.8 (“Adult Entertainment as a Conditional Use”) of the Shelburne Zoning Bylaw. No applications for Adult Entertainment Uses shall be allowed under the SR-FBOD. 


2200.3 	Severability 
2200.3A 	If any provision of this article is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this article and the zoning bylaw will not be affected but will remain in full force. 
2201 	REGULATING PLAN 

2201.1 	General Provisions 
2201.1A 	Purpose. The Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B) and associated Character Districts establish the general standards for building form, placement and use, as well as street types, applicable to each lot. These general standards are de.ned and illustrated in greater detail in CHAPTER 2202, CHAPTER 2203, and CHAPTER 2204. Elements of the Regulating Plan Include: 
1) 	Character Districts. The SR-FBOD contains seven Character Districts as delineated on the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B) representing a variety of development patterns, forms, uses, and intensities based on the 2014 Shelburne Road Illustrative Plan (FIGURE 2200-A) derived from the community design charrette and vision for the corridor. 
2) 	Frontage Zones. Frontage zones are special areas on the Shelburne Road corridor where there is an emphasis on creating small neighborhood centers. As depicted in the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B), frontage zones are focused on UISFF signalized intersections at .BSUJOHEBMF3PBEHullcrest Road and Longmeadow Road. Frontage zones include thecontiguous land area from the edge of the public right-of-way to therear edge of the build-to-zone as defined in SECTION 2203.2. 
3) 	Primary Street Type. These streets generally carry higher volumes and provide access to other districts within Shelburne as well as the region. See CHAPTER 2204 for speci.c primary street type and design standards. 
4) 	Secondary Street Type. These streets generally carry lower volumes and provide access to adjacent neighborhoods. See CHAPTER 2204 for speci.c secondary street type and design standards. 
5) 	Build-To-Zone. The build-to zone is the area on the lot where the street-facing façade of a primary building must be located, the edge of which is a build-to-line. Numbers on the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B) indicate the minimum and maximum distance in feet from the front property or right-of-way line, and side property or right-of-way line on corner lots. 
6) 	Build-To-Line. Analogous to a maximum building setback, the build­to-line is a line marking where the street-facing facade of a primary building must be located in some Character Districts. Numbers on the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B) labeled per the key as Route 7 Front Setback indicate distance in feet from the front setback line to the 
7)  Build-To-Zone Occupancy. The build-to-zone occupancy refers to  
amount of the front building facade that must be located in the build­ 
to-zone, based on the width of the building divided by the width of  
the lot.  
8)  Future Streets and Paths. These corridor designations generally identify  
potential locations for future streets and paths that would enhance  
access to and connectivity between centers, street corridors, and  
neighborhoods. While the feasibility and appropriateness of speci.c  
thoroughfares would be determined at development review and  
may not necessarily be required, these corridors as identi.ed in the  
Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B) are deemed important to achieving  
the desired development patterns and a multi-modal transportation  
system, reducing traf.c impacts and intersection queuing along  
Shelburne Road, and improving the general sustainability of the SR­ 
FBOD.  
9)  Conservation. Dedicated open space either publicly or privately owned  
is identi.ed on the Regulating Plan (FIGURE 2200-B).

2201.2 Character Districts 
2201.2A Mixed Use Street Character District (MUSCD) 

1) Intent. The MUSCD is intended to provide an attractive northern gateway into Shelburne that provides a clear visual delineation of the town line. The district is also intended to provide commercial opportunities catering to travelers on Shelburne Road within an area that is safe and inviting to pedestrians through .exibility in building placement, convenient pedestrian and automobile circulation (provided in part by new interior multi-modal streets), and small-scale public spaces. 

2201.2B Mixed Use Neighborhood Character District (MUNCD) 

1) 	Intent. The MUNCD is centered on the intersection of Route 7 at Longmeadow Drive and the access road to Shelburne Commons and Rice Lumber. It is intended to accommodate a mix of new residential uses with expanded commercial uses in a mix of smaller scale new buildings and additions to existing buildings that provide enclosure along Shelburne Road. New interior streets provide multi-modal access to neighborhoods. Building patterns re.ect the character of traditional village design with irregular setbacks, integrated open spaces, complete streets, varied 
building size and massing, and projecting 
elements. Sidewalks and paths connect to 
surrounding neighborhoods and corridors. 



2201.2C Green Corridor Character District (GCCD) 
1) 	Intent. The GCCD is located north and south of the Bay Road and Route 7 intersection. Much of the GCCD lies within the watershed of an impaired waterway. It is intended to preserve the existing pattern of large setbacks for buildings along this portion of Shelburne Road while also providing multi-modal access. Commercial and residential buildings are intended to be clustered into less environmentally sensitive areas of the district. The open space in the GCCD is intended to accommodate environmental bene.ts, passive and active recreation, agriculture and civic gatherings. 



Effective Date: 8/5/20 

2201.2D Business Campus Character District (BCCD) 
1) 	Intent. The BCCD includes the area near the Bay Road intersection and southern end of the SR-FBOD. The BCCD is intended to provide opportunities for a variety of business enterprises that do not require visibility from Shelburne Road. It is also intended to provide multi-modal access to properties in the Character District. The development standards provide considerable .exibility. 




2201.2E Special Uses Character District (SUCD) 
1) 	Intent. The SUCD is located east of Shelburne Road south of the Bay Road intersection. It is intended to accommodate a broad range of building types generally clustered into traditional neighborhood or campus development patterns to preserve open spaces and views from Shelburne Road. Development potential includes pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, research and academic institutions, or visitor accommodations and facilities. 



Effective Date: 8/5/20 


2201.2F 	Mixed Residential Character District (MRCD) 

1) Intent. The MRCD covers the existing or potential residential areas along Shelburne Road. Much of the MRCD is located in the Residential zoning district and will largely remain as currently developed. Where opportunities exist for expansion, redevelopment and new development, the MRCD is intended to accommodate a mix of attached and detached residential building types in pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods. New sites and neighborhoods should be accessed through relatively narrow tree-lined streets and integrated with pedestrian and bicycle amenities, small parks, and connections to surrounding neighborhoods and the village center. 


2201.2G 	Conservation Character District (CCD) 
1) 	Intent. The CCD will remain predominantly undeveloped and in its natural state, providing passive and active recreational opportunities as appropriate for the SR-FBOD. 

2201.3 	Building Types and Forms Standards. 
2201.3A 	Building Types and Form Standards. FIGURE 2201-C below shows the allowed building types by Character District. FIGURE 2203-C through FIGURE 2203-M contain detailed building and form standards for each building type. 


2201.3B 	Other Building Types. Other building types are not permitted except as specially authorized in CHAPTER 2207.

2202 	ALLOWED USES AND FUNCTIONAL STANDARDS 
2202.1 	Allowed Uses 
2202.1A 	Intent. This section establishes the principal and accessory uses allowed in the SR-FBOD. 
2202.1B 	Principal Uses. FIGURE 2202-A lists the principal uses, grouped by category, allowed by administrative or conditional use permit in different building types. Principal uses listed in FIGURE 2202-A also must comply with the functional standards in SECTION 2202.4. 
2202.1C Accessory Uses. Accessory uses, and related accessory structures, are allowed in conjunction with principal uses. General authority for accessory uses is found under SECTION 2202.3, while certain additional requirements for accessory uses are specified in the bottom portion of FIGURE 2202-A. 

2202.2 	Use Determination 
2202.2A 	Responsibility. The Zoning Administrative Officer (AO) is responsible for categorizing uses. 
2202.2B 	Materially Similar Uses. If a proposed use is not covered by a use category, but is substantially, materially, and outwardly similar to another listed use, the AO will treat the proposed use as a use under that category. 
2202.2C 	Prohibited Uses. If a proposed use is not similar to any other listed use, the use will be prohibited. 

2202.3 	Accessory Uses and Structures 
2202.3A 	Relationship to a Principal Use or Structure. Accessory uses and structures must be clearly incidental and subordinate to a permitted principal use or structure, and must comply with the definitions contained in Article XXI. No accessory use or structure may be established prior to the establishment of a permitted principal use or building. 
2202.3B 	Responsibility. The AO is responsible for determining whether a use or structure is accessory. In order to classify a use or structure as accessory, the AO must determine that the use or structure: 
1) 	Is subordinate to the principal use or building in terms of area, extent and purpose; 
2) 	Contributes to the comfort, convenience or necessity of occupants of the principal use or building served; 
3) 	Is located on the same lot as the principal use of building, or on a contiguous lot in the same ownership when the lots are both subject to a common development approval granted by the town; 
4) 	Involves operations in keeping with the character of the principal use or building served; and 
5) Is not of a nature likely to attract visitors in larger numbers than would normally be expected for the principal use or building. 
2202.3C 	Dimensional Standards. Accessory structures must meet the setback and height requirements of SECTION 2203.2. 


2202.4 	Functional Standards 
2202.4A 	Applicability. Unless otherwise specified in FIGURE 2202-A, the following functional standards for specific uses will apply to the SR-FBOD. Functional standards are standards applied according to the use and function of a property, as distinct from standards derived from a building form. 
2202.4B 	Residential Uses 
1) 	Residential uses must meet the building form standards in CHAPTER 2203 specified for individual building types that accommodate household living units. 
2) 	No civic, commercial, or industrial use is permitted above a residential use. This will not be interpreted to prohibit common use areas or facilities serving building residents on any floor or roof-top level of a building. 
3) 	A lobby serving an upper floor residential use is permitted on the ground floor of a commercial use. 
2202.4C 	Uses Allowed in a Civic Building. Only the specific civic uses listed in FIGURE 2202-A are allowed in a civic building type. 
2202.4D 	Agricultural Uses. Agricultural uses, including Integrated Agriculture, as defined in Article XXI are allowed in all Character Districts. See SECTION 2204.5 for agricultural uses that would meet Open Space requirements. 

2202.4E 	Mobile Food Vendors 
1) 	A mobile food vendor or food truck is an enclosed unit, truck, or trailer, or similar vehicle-mounted unit as defined in the Town of Shelburne Food Truck Ordinance as follows: “A food truck includes a licensed, motorized vehicle or mobile food unit, including a trailer or converted recreational vehicle, equipped to refrigerate and/or cook food where, on a temporary basis, such food items are sold to the general public or to individuals attending a special event.” 
2) 	Mobile food vendors are an encouraged use as they add to the mixed-use character of the SR-FBOD. 
3) 	Applicants are advised to familiarize themselves with the Town of Shelburne Food Truck Ordinance including details on licensing and locating food truck units, parking, signage, noise and other standards. 

2202.4F 	Drive-Through Facilities 
1) 	Vehicles using drive-through facilities may not encroach on or interfere with the public use of streets and sidewalks by vehicles or pedestrians. 
2) 	Drive-through facilities and objects associated with the drive-through must be located to the side or rear of the building. Drive-through windows and lanes may not be placed between the street and associated buildings. 
3) 	No drive-through window or lane is permitted on the side or rear of a building facing a residential district. 
4) 	There are additional requirements pertaining to drive-through facilities in PARAGRAPH 2205.2I(6). 

2202.4G 	Parking Garages 
1) 	The ground story of a parking garage must have active, non-parking uses located between the parking garage and the primary street right-of-way. 
2) 	Where upper stories of a parking garage are located at the perimeter of a building, they must be screened so that cars are not visible from ground level view from adjacent property or adjacent primary or secondary public street right-of-way. 
3) 	Parking garage floors fronting a primary public street right-of-way must be level and not inclined.

2204 	PUBLIC REALM STANDARDS 

2204.1 	Applicability 
2204.1A 	General Applicability. The public realm standards: 
1) 	Apply to land development as well as the construction of new streets, reconstruction of existing streets, and development of public and publicly accessible open spaces within the SR-FBOD; and 
2) 	Establish the rules and standards for street design, streetscape design and open space design. 
3) 	A vehicular way providing access to three or more dwelling units or principal buildings will be considered a street. 
2204.1B 	New Streets. Where an applicant proposes to construct a new street, the new street alignment must conform to FIGURE 2200-B unless an alternative alignment or connection is approved under CHAPTER 2207. 


2204.1C 	Existing Streets 
1) 	An existing street cannot be rebuilt or substantially extended except in conformance with this article. 
2) 	The developer must install sidewalks and street trees as needed to conform with the standards in FIGURE 2204-D through FIGURE 2204-J for the applicable street type irrespective of whether the existing street will be rebuilt. 
3) 	For the purposes of this section, rebuilding is defined as any of the following: 
a. 	
Construction modifying the existing base or sub-base material; 

b. 	
Pavement milling to a depth of 4 inches or greater; or 

c. 	
Construction to enclose previously open drainage infrastructure, such as ditches, with materials other than culverts. 


4) 	For the purposes of this section, substantially extended is defined as any of the following: 
a. 	
Construction expanding the width of the existing street by more than 3 feet; or 

b. 	
Extending the length of the existing street by more than 200 feet. 


2204.2 	Street Type Specifications 
2204.2A 	General Intent 
1) 	Streets are primary public spaces and must be designed and constructed to serve as an attractive framework for villages, neighborhoods, corridors, civic institutions, and special use districts. 
Page XXII-28 
2) 	Streets must balance the need of different combinations of transportation modes including auto, service vehicle, bus transit, bicycle and pedestrian to maximize safety, access, mobility and convenience for all residents and users. Street character will vary depending on location. Where competing objectives exist, the needs of pedestrians and bicyclists must be given consideration consistent with the principles contained within Vermont’s “Complete Streets” law (Act 34 of the Vermont Legislature, 2011). 
3) 	Village and neighborhood center streets (designed according to applicable street types) are intended to create pedestrian-oriented places that balance different transportation modes. The neighborhood street types are designed primarily for pedestrians and bicyclists, with automobile movement as a secondary focus. The boulevard and business park street types are geared more to the free movements of vehicles, while maintaining good walking and bicycling facilities. 
4) 	Future public and private roadway infrastructure construction in the Shelburne Road corridor must incorporate a broad range of “green streets” design elements such as street trees, permeable pavements, bioretention, swales, and other techniques to the maximum extent feasible given soil and other site-specific conditions. Although the design and appearance of streets will vary, the functional goals are the same: provide source control of stormwater, limit its transport and pollutant conveyance to the collection system, restore pre-development hydrology to the extent possible, and provide environmentally enhanced thoroughfares. Successful application of green techniques will encourage soil and 
3) 	Street Type Deviations. The Development Review Board may approve a request for a waiver filed pursuant to SECTION 2207.5 to deviate from street type specifications where: 
a. 	
Strict enforcement would be physically impractical due to site specific conditions; or 

b. 	
Special circumstances warrant the use of an alternative street type. 


2204.2C 	Street Design. FIGURE 2204-D through FIGURE 2204-J establish the design standards for each street type. New streets must conform to the design standards for the applicable street type except that the Development Review Board may approve a request for a waiver filed pursuant to SECTION 2207.5: 
1) 	For changes related to curbing, drainage facilities, landscaping, and paving materials consistent with low-impact design principles of SECTION 2205.3 that would enhance on-site stormwater management; or 
2) 	To allow traditional curb-and-gutter drainage where site constraints prevent the use of the sustainable design principles and practices of SECTION 2205.3. 
3) 	For changes to ROW width where site constraints prevent strict adherence to the ROW profiles depicted in FIGURES 2204-D through 2204-J 
vegetation contact and infiltration and retention of FIGURE 2204-A. STREET AND THOROUGHFARE TYPES stormwater. 
2204.2B 	Street Type. FIGURE 2204-A establishes the specific street and thoroughfare types allowed within each Character District. 
1) 	Roundabouts. Roundabouts are: 
a.

2204.5 	Public and Civic Open Space Standards 
2204.5A 	Intent. The intent of these standards is to provide for a combination of viable public and private open spaces and civic gathering areas. 
2204.5B 	Applicability. Open and civic space includes street spaces as defined in SECTION 2204.4 as well as dedicated spaces that are either publicly owned or publicly accessible and are intended for the gathering of people for passive or active recreation, entertainment and organized communal activities. 
2204.5C 	Open Space Types. FIGURE 2204-L identifies the specific public and private open space types allowed within the SR-FBOD. 


2204.5D 	Open Space Design Standards 
1) 	General Standards. Applicants must design, landscape, and furnish public and private open spaces to be consistent with the Character District in which they are located. 
2) 	Allocation of Lot for Open Space. Individual property owners must use a minimum percentage of their lot for open space as established in FIGURE 2203-C through FIGURE 2203-M for the applicable building type as follows: 
a. 	
The open space must be one of the types identified in FIGURE 2204-L. 

b. 	
Two or more property owners within the SR-FBOD may create a joint open space as long as the dedicated space is accessible to the public and provides an area of open space equal to or greater than the combined area of open space required for the properties involved. 

c. 	
For the purposes of meeting this requirement, open space must not include any impervious area or area with a runoff coefficient greater than 0.9. 


3) 	Allocation of Development Site for Open Space. New developments involving a site area of 5 acres, 8 or more dwelling units, or 10,000 square feet of commercial or mixed use building space must allocate a minimum of 5% of the site to common open space as follows: 
a. 	
The common open space must be one or more of the types identified in FIGURE 2204-L. 

b. 	
Adjacent development sites subject to this requirement may create a joint common open space as long as the dedicated space is accessible to the public and amounts to a minimum of 5% of the land area of all the properties involved. 


4) 	Sustainable Design. Open spaces must conform to the minimum unpaved pervious surface (turf, groundcover, mulch, etc.) requirement established in FIGURE 2204-L for the applicable type. Applicants are encouraged to maximize the use of pervious paving materials that allow oxygen and water for tree roots and to absorb stormwater run­
off in all open spaces. 
5) 	Low Impact Development (LID) Applications on Open Space. If the selected open space types include pavement or other hardscape surfaces, applicants must integrate low impact development (LID) applications consistent with those authorized in SECTION 2205.3 into the design of the open space. 
2204.5E 	Use of Street Space along Private and Public Frontages. The active use of private and public frontages (the area between the primary building facade and back of curb) in a manner consistent with the applicable Character District is encouraged. Pedestrian access and outdoor accessory uses are allowed in the street space consistent with the following: 
1) 	Outdoor Activity Zones. Outdoor activities are allowed and encouraged where applicable as accessory uses to restaurants, retail and personal services within street yard and side yard areas on private lots as follows: 
a. 	
Outdoor dining areas may be extended onto the public sidewalk with conditional use approval under CHAPTER 2207. 

b. 	
Where outdoor dining is located on a public sidewalk, a minimum of 5 feet of unobstructed passage and accessible routes compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act must be provided for pedestrian use. 

c. 	
All furnishings must be removed from the public portion of the sidewalk at the close of business each day. 


2) 	Outdoor Display. Outdoor display of products available for sale will be permitted in association with non-residential ground floor use in accordance with the following provisions: 
a. 	
The outdoor display area must not occupy more than 30% of the horizontal length of the building facade. 

b. 	
The outdoor display area may be located within the street yard setback area. 

c. 	
The outdoor display area may be located on a public sidewalk with conditional use approval under CHAPTER 2207 provided that the display area will be located within 5 feet of the primary building and a minimum of 5 feet of unobstructed passage and accessible routes compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act will be provided for pedestrian use. 

d. 	
Outdoor display must be removed and placed inside a fully-enclosed building at the end of each business day. 


FIGURE 2204-L. OPEN AND CIVIC SPACE STANDARDS 


OPEN SPACE TYPE AND STANDARDS Preserve: A preserve is an area comprised of natural resources and constraints available for limited public access and low impact recreation. Its landscape may consist of paths and trails, meadows, woodland, wetlands, floodplains, scenic vistas, and other natural attributes. Preserves may be lineal, such as the natural corridor along brooks, rivers and lakes. The liner preserves should connect to surrounding neighborhood and civic buildings.  DIAGRAM  CHARACTER EXAMPLE  Suggested Frontage on at Least: No street but easement possible  Typical Lot Size 0.5 acres min  Minimum Unpaved Pervious Surfaces 90%  MUS •  MUN • FORM-BAS BC • ED DISTR GC • ICTS / CH SU • ARACTER  MR • DISTRICTS  CD •  
Park: A park is a natural preserve available for active and passive recreation. Parks should connect to surrounding neighborhood and civic buildings. These open spaces are typically larger green spaces and should be located at the edge of or between Character Districts. Parks must accommodate active or passive recreation. Its landscape must consist of one or more of the following: paths and trails, meadows, woodland, community gardens, open shelters, playgrounds, playing fields, and courts, all naturalistically disposed.  
 
 1 street  0.5 acres min  90%  •  •  •  •  •  •  •

2205.1F 	Parking Requirement Exemptions 
1) 	Structured Parking. Spaces provided within the footprint of a structure containing 1 or more other uses, including rooftop, at-grade, or below-grade spaces will not be limited by the maximum off-street parking requirement provided that the square footage footprint dedicated to structured parking will be less than 50% of the total square footage footprint that would be required for surface parking. 
2) 	Outdoor Dining. Permitted outdoor dining located on the same site as the primary use and building will be exempt from the calculation of required off-street parking spaces. 
2205.1G 	Reduction of Minimum Off-Street Parking Requirements. The DRB may grant conditional use approval for a reduction of up to 50% in the number of required non-handicapped-accessible off-street parking spaces or may require a reduction upon consideration of the standards below. 
1) 	Landowner Discretionary Reductions. Parking reduction factors that may be considered by the DRB include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a. 	Mixed Use Shared Parking Efficiencies. The DRB may approve a parking reduction calculated in accordance with FIGURE 2205­M upon the applicant demonstrating that multiple uses will be sharing parking in accordance with the following: 
i. 	The peak parking demand periods of the uses will occur at different times; 
ii. 	A shared parking agreement exists between proximate properties with different peak parking demand times; 
iii. 	The uses sharing parking have a high rate of parking turnover; and/or 
iv. 	
There is evidence of similar uses and location situations operating successfully with lower than required amounts of parking. 

v. 	
If the size of the requested parking reduction exceeds 25%, the applicant must submit an evaluation of parking demand following the procedures of the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Shared Parking Manual (latest edition), the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Shared Parking Guidelines (latest addition) or other procedures approved by the DRB. 


vi. 	The DRB may waive the required evaluation for small developments where there is established experience with the land use mix and the impact is expected to be minimal. 
b. 	Pedestrian Access and Facilities. The site: 
i. 	Is located within a Character District with sufficient residential and/or commercial density and appropriate infrastructure to support pedestrian and bicycle travel between existing and proposed uses; 
ii. 	Can support pedestrian and bicycle access as a primary means of travel; and 
iii. 	Offers a viable alternative to access by a personal vehicle. 
c. 	
Proximity to Public Parking. There is reasonable proximity to publicly-available off-street parking lots or on-street parking spaces. 

d. 	
Public Parking Reserve. In lieu of providing the total minimum on-site parking required, the DRB may accept a permanent easement on the property for the purposes of constructing public parking for all or a portion of required on-site parking spaces. The reserve easement will be subject to review and approval by the Selectboard. 

e. 	
Proximity to Public Transit. The site is within ¼ mile walking distance of public transit (including bus transit and future 



commuter rail transit) and the proposed uses are conducive to  
transit usage.  
f.  Car-Sharing Program. The DRB may approve a parking reduction  
where an active car-sharing program will be made available to  
residents and/or employees; and where cars for the car-share  
program will be available on the site or within a 700-foot walking  
distance of the site.  
g.  Transportation Demand Mitigation (TDM) Plans. Transportation  
mitigation plans may be implemented in conjunction with any  
use.

2) 	Development Review Board Reductions 
a. 	
Transportation Demand Mitigation Plans. TDM Plans will be required for all large-scale parking facilities, where the required number of parking spaces exceeds 250. New construction of large- scale parking facilities, or any change to existing uses that requires additional parking on site that would create large-scale parking facilities, may also require the applicant to employ parking mitigation to reduce the number of surface parking spaces if determined appropriate by the DRB. Qualifying parking mitigation may include but will not be limited to: shared and structured parking; parking shuttles and van services; employee carpool plans; incentives for employees to use alternative transportation such as bicycles, transit, and walking; telecommuting plans for employees; car sharing and corporate vehicle fleets for employee use, and other similar programs. The DRB will have the discretion to require parking mitigation for large-scale facilities as appropriate taking into consideration stormwater, surface water impairment, the character of the neighborhood, traffic, pedestrian safety, landscaping, and circulation. 

b. 	
Parking Reserve. In lieu of or along with an absolute reduction, the DRB may require a portion of the site to be reserved but not developed to comply with the off-street parking requirement. The reserved area must be either landscaped or maintained in a 


natural state. The reserved area will not count towards any open space standard specified in Section 2204.2. 
i. 	The reserved parking area must be labeled as “Reserve Parking” on the site plan and maintained in a landscaped or natural state. It must not be used for building area. 
ii. 	If, after one year from the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, the DRB finds that any of the reserve spaces are needed or not needed, the DRB may require that all or any portion of the spaces identified as reserve parking on the site plan be constructed or eliminated from the plan within a reasonable time period, as specified in writing by the DRB following a public meeting with the owner of the property. 
c. 	Parking Reduction Plan. To this end, the DRB may require the applicant to provide a formal parking study that includes the following: 
i. 	Size and type of existing and proposed uses or activities on site; 
ii. 	Rate of parking turnover; 
iii. 	Peak traffic and parking loads to be encountered; 
iv. 	
Shared parking reductions reference credible sources such as Urban Land Institute’s Shared Parking Manual or SmartCode 

9.2 Shared Parking Matrix (see above); 

v. 	
Availability of on-street or public parking facilities or existing shared parking lots; 


vi. 	Availability of public transit, bicycle infrastructure, and pedestrian infrastructure; 
vii. 	Other factors identified by the DRB. 
3) 	Conditional Use Permit Criteria. Before an applicant can receive Conditional Use Approval, the applicant must demonstrate to the DRB that the proposed Conditional Use complies with the following SR­FBOD-specific criteria: 
a. 	
The reduction is in harmony with the purpose and intent of the SR-FBOD; 

b. 	
The amount of off-street parking to be provided will be sufficient to serve the use(s) for which it is intended; 

c. 	
The reduction will not create, nor add to, undue congestion or unsafe traffic situations; and 

d. 	
The proposed parking layout and landscaping will be in conformity with all applicable Zoning Bylaws requirements. 


2205.1H 	Bicycle Parking. To facilitate bicycle use, the following bicycle parking regulations will apply: 
1) 	Multi-Family Residential Developments. Developments with 5 or more multi-family units must provide at least one indoor covered bicycle parking area with space for 5 bicycles for every 5 dwelling 
units. 
2) 	Non-Residential Uses. Non-residential uses must provide the following minimum bicycle parking spaces. A single typical inverted-U rack or pole rack accommodates 2 bicycles.

 Rear Parking Placement with Side Access  
Side Parking Placement with Front and Side Access  
General Design Guidelines and Associated Requirements. The building should be brought forward as close to the street as possible, with parking and other services tucked around the side and back. The parking area must be designed in regular, rectangular shapes. Irregular wedge shaped parking areas created by following angled property lines are discouraged. Only the minimal amount of paved area necessary to meet the requirements should be provided.  
A The primary building entry must be placed at the front of the building (facing the front lot line) and be clearly identifiable from the street.  
B Parking must be placed at the side or rear of the lot. Where possible, break the parking areas up into groups of no more than 20 spaces per area (35 for large development projects) separated by landscaping areas.  
C Applicant must place as much of the building width at the front of the lot as possible to maximize front facade exposure to the traveling public. The front facade should be kept parallel to the street.  
D To reinforce the “street-edge”, align with adjacent buildings which are also close to the front setback line. Landscaping can also be used to reinforce this line.  
E Link with adjacent parking lots or provide shared parking areas which can serve neighboring buildings simultaneously.  
F Provide sidewalks for the full width of the property with a direct link to the primary building entry.  
G Loading docks, service areas and trash facilities must be located at the rear of the building and not visible from the street. Fences, walls or landscaping can be used to shield them from view.  
H Existing, older trees must be incorporated into new site plan development whenever possible.  
I Curb cuts must be limited to a single driveway in and out of the property from the primary or secondary street unless specifically authorized elsewhere in the SR-FBOD. Secondary access points from side roads are encouraged. Curb cuts must only be as wide as necessary to accommodate needed lanes. Curb radiuses should be kept to a minimum. Any raised curbing used at site access point must allow for sufficient stormwater infiltration.  
J Landscaped islands and other green space must be consolidated into useful areas, and not just narrow strips of grass or plantings.  
K Provide a continuous landscape screen on rear property boundaries that are in residential zoning districts.  
L Using the area in front of the building for outdoor activity, seating and display is highly encouraged and the area will not be included for calculation of the minimum required parking spaces.  
M Provide supplemental street trees where appropriate to shade the sidewalk or outdoor terraces while providing filtered views of the front façade by traveling motorists  

meet the dimensional standards presented in FIGURE 2205-Q unless proposed dimensions are waived per the requirements set forth in SECTION 2207.5. 
4) 	Special Parking Types and Standards. Each required off-street parking space must be designed so that any motor vehicle may proceed to and from the space without requiring the moving of any other vehicle. Additional parking requirements are provided for below: 
a.

Sections. Parking areas must be broken into sections not to exceed 140 cars per section. Sections must be separated by landscaped buffers to provide visual relief. At a minimum, the buffers must consist of islands which must be a combination of “divider islands” and “terminal islands.” 

b. 	
Low Impact Development (LID) Practices. Applicants must use islands for gathering and treating runoff in conjunction with stormwater best management practices such as swales, vegetated buffer strips and bioretention areas. 

c. 	
Divider Islands. Divider islands must be used to separate rows of parking. 


i. 	At least 1 landscaped divider island must be provided for every 4 parallel rows of parking. For parking lots with more than 2 sections separated by divider islands, pedestrian walkways connecting the parking area to sidewalks and/ or building entrances must be incorporated into every other divider island. 
ii. 	A divider island must not be less than 10 feet in any dimension. 
iii. 	A divider island must be planted with 1 shade tree for every 10 parking stalls and 1 understory tree for every 15 parking stalls that abut the island. 
iv. 	
Shade and understory trees must be planted throughout each island so that no tree is located more 40 feet (measured on center) from another. 

v. 	
Shrubs, bushes, and other ground cover must be installed on pervious surfaces and maintained as appropriate. 


vi. 	Trees must not be planted closer than 4 feet to the curbing. 
d. 	
Terminal Islands. The following design standards apply to terminal islands: 

i. 	Landscaped terminal islands must be provided at the ends of rows of parking where such rows are adjacent to driveways or vehicular travel lanes. 
ii. 	Terminal islands must separate groups of parking spaces in a row, such that no continuous line of adjoining spaces contains more than 25 parking spaces. 
iii. 	Terminal Islands must not be less than 9 feet in any dimension. 
iv. 	
Terminal islands must contain 1 shade tree for each abutting row of parking spaces. 

v. 	
Terminal islands may contain grass, groundcover and evergreen shrubs. Such vegetation must be planted in a pattern that does not inhibit visibility by and of pedestrians and those driving vehicles. Such vegetation must also be planted in a manner that prevents damage to vegetation due to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 



e. 	
Alternative Design. The number of contiguous parking spaces in a row may be increased from 25 to 35 provided that: 


i. 	Divider islands are not less than 15 feet in any dimension, and the number of shade trees is at least 1 per 7 abutting parking stalls and the number of understory trees is at least 1 per 10 abutting parking stalls. 
ii. 	Terminal islands are not less than 12 feet in any dimension, and contain, in addition to 1 shade tree for each abutting row of parking spaces, at least 1 understory tree. 
3) 	Perimeter Landscaping. The perimeter of all parking areas must be surrounded by a landscape area as follows: 
a. 	
Surface parking areas must provide minimum perimeter landscaping of at least 5 feet along each side property line, and be increased to a 20-foot minimum width where adjacent to existing residential districts. 

b. 	
In addition, all parking area perimeters adjacent to any public street must provide a continuous landscaped area to a minimum depth of 15 feet. Landscaped berms, hedgerows, shrubbery or any combination may be used as appropriate to fulfill this requirement. 

c. 	
Trees must be planted at an average distance not to exceed 40 feet on center and aligned parallel 3 to 7 feet behind the property line. 

d. 	
Breaks for pedestrian and vehicle access are allowed. 


4) 	Pervious Materials. Pervious or semi-pervious parking area surfacing materials, such as pervious asphalt, grass, grasscrete, or ring and grid systems, are encouraged where ground conditions allow for adequate 
infiltration. 
5) 	Protection from Damage. In order to preserve landscaped open space from damage by parking cars and snow removal operations, bumper overhang areas must be provided with permeable ground cover that will not be damaged by bumpers or vehicle drippings and all landscaped open space must be provided with suitable curbing, which must contain openings or interruptions to allow infiltration by runoff. 
2205.2G 	Transitional Buffer. The following transitional buffer requirements apply along perimeter lot lines located: along boundaries between Character Districts; along boundaries between Character Districts and residential zoning districts; and as prescribed in FIGURE 2203-A. See FIGURE 2205-R. 
1) 	General Provisions. 
a. 	
A required transitional buffer must be located within the outer perimeter of the lot, parallel to and extending to the property boundary line and must be provided along the entire frontage immediately abutting the property line. See FIGURE 2205-S. 

b. 	
The width of the buffer strip is determined exclusive of any required setback; however, the required buffer may be located wholly or partially within a required setback. 

c. 	
The parking of vehicles and the placement of buildings is not allowed in a required buffer. All required setbacks apply. 

d.

Outdoor site lighting must meet the standards of Article XIX Section 1975 and primarily be used to provide safety and secondarily to accent key building and landscape features. Additionally, light fixtures must be designed as an integral element of site design and may be expressed through style, material or color. 

2205.2K 	Utilities and Services 
1) 	Utilities. Existing above-ground utility lines must be buried underground, or moved behind buildings where technically feasible. New electrical and communication utilities in the SR-FBOD must be placed underground. 
2) 	Mechanical Utilities. Mechanical equipment must be screened from view of adjacent properties and public rights-of-way and designed to be an integral part of the building. 
2205.2L 	Maintenance. The owner or tenant is responsible for maintaining all required landscaping in good health or condition. Any dead, unhealthy, deteriorating, broken or missing landscaping must be replaced with landscaping that conforms to this article within 30 days (or within 180 days where weather concerns would jeopardize the health of plant materials). 
2205.3 	Sustainable Design and Development Site Performance Standards 
2205.3A 	Intent. Sustainable Design and Low Impact Development (LID) techniques are highly encouraged, and in some cases required, in the SR-FBOD to achieve low net energy consumption, reduced stormwater runoff and higher water quality, reduced vehicle miles traveled in the SR-FBOD and surrounding districts, and support dark night skies, high canopy tree cover, and production of local food. 


2205.3B 	Stormwater Management 

1) 	Purpose. The purpose of this section is: 
a. 	
To promote stormwater management practices that maintain pre­development hydrology through site design, site development, building design and landscape design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate and detain stormwater close to its source; 

b. 	
To protect water resources, particularly streams, lakes, wetlands, floodplains and other natural aquatic systems on the development site and elsewhere from degradation that could be caused by construction activities and post-construction conditions; 

c. 	
To protect other properties from damage that could be caused by stormwater and sediment from improperly managed construction activities and post-construction conditions on the development site; 

d. 	
To reduce the impacts on surface waters from impervious surfaces such as streets, parking lots, rooftops and other paved surfaces; and 

e. 	
To promote public safety from flooding and streambank erosion, reduce public expenditures in removing sediment from stormwater drainage systems and natural resource areas, and to prevent damage to municipal infrastructure from inadequate stormwater controls. 


2) 	Applicability. 
a. 	
These regulations apply to any land development within the SR­FBOD where one-half acre or more of impervious area exists or will exist on an applicant’s property or properties making up the project site. 

b. 	
If the combination of new impervious area created and the redevelopment or substantial reconstruction of existing impervious surfaces is less than 3,000 square feet, then the application is exempt from requirements in this section. 

c. 	
Applications meeting the criteria set forth in (a) and not exempt under (b) must meet the requirements in SECTION 2205.3B(3). 


i. 	If the area of the lot (or lots) being redeveloped or substantially reconstructed is less than 50% of the lot’s existing impervious area, then only those portions of the lot that are being redeveloped or substantially reconstructed must comply with SECTION 2205.3B(3). New impervious area must meet the requirements of SECTION 2205.3B(3). 
ii. 	If the area of the lot (or lots) that is being redeveloped or substantially reconstructed exceeds 50% of the lot’s existing impervious area, then all of the lot’s impervious surfaces must comply with all parts of SECTION 2205.3B(3). New impervious area must meet the requirements of SECTION 2205.4B(3). 
3) 	Stormwater Best Practices. 
a. 	
The Water Quality Volume (WQv) as defined in the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual for the lot’s impervious surfaces must not be allowed to leave the lot via overland runoff, and must be reused or infiltrated using Low Impact Development practices, including, but not limited to, practices detailed in the Shelburne Low Impact Development Guidance Manual. If it is not possible to infiltrate the volume of stormwater runoff specified in this section due to one or more of the constraints listed in Subparagraphs i through vi below, then the WQv must be retained on the lot using other Low Impact Development (LID) strategies and practices such as those detailed in the Shelburne Low Impact Development Guidance Manual or treated by stormwater treatment practices meeting the Water Quality Treatment Standard as described in the most recently adopted version of the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual. Constraints on infiltration recognized in these regulations include the following: 

i. 	Seasonally high or shallow groundwater as defined in the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual; 
ii. 	Shallow bedrock as defined in the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual; 
iii. 	Soil infiltration rates of less than 0.2 inches per hour; 
iv. 	
Contaminated soils; 

v. 	
The presence of a “stormwater hotspot” as defined in Section 2.3 of the Vermont Stormwater Management Manual; 


vi. 	Other site conditions subject to the review and approval of the AO. 

b. 	
The post-construction peak runoff rate for the 1-year, 24-hour 


(2.1 inch) rain event must not exceed the existing peak runoff rate for the same storm event from the site under existing conditions prior to submittal of an application. LID practices must be incorporated into the design as necessary to achieve the required runoff rate. If constraints prevent the use of LID practices, stormwater treatment practices detailed in the Vermont Stormwater Management manual may be used to achieve the required post construction runoff rate. 


2205.3C 	Sustainable Landscaping and Open Space 
1) 	Natural Landscaping 
a. 	Natural and context-sensitive landscaping with plants native to local climate and soil conditions are required in the SR-FBOD. These plants thrive naturally, requiring less maintenance and irrigation than most hybrid or imported varieties. 
b. 	
Natural resource preservation and landscaping should be used to minimize the need for irrigation systems and improve planting longevity. Preserving existing wooded areas, mature trees, and natural terrain can give new developments a premium “mature landscape” appearance and provide residents with additional recreational amenities. 

c. 	
Plant materials should be selected for their form, color, and texture, as well as solar, soil, and moisture requirements. It is also recommended that native plants (vegetation that grows naturally in particular climates or regions) be used because of their performance, site enhancement, and life-cycle cost benefits. 


2) 	Canopy and Shade Trees. The broad use of street canopy trees in the SR-FBOD is a simple and attractive solution to reducing heating and cooling needs for buildings and sites. SECTION 2204.4 contains requirements for soil quality and volume that ensure that street canopy trees, and other newly planted trees in the public realm, can grow to a size where they provide substantial habitat, stormwater management, economic, and other benefits. When planted on the south and west sides of buildings, shade trees keep buildings cool in summer and then drop their leaves during the cooler fall season allowing warming sunlight to reach sidewalks and buildings. Additionally, they create a lush canopy in the warmer months. 
3) 	Infiltration Parks. This form of bioretention allows rainwater to be temporarily captured and stored for a short time, cleaning stormwater runoff before infiltration. Portions of public parks and open spaces may be part of the stormwater system. Surrounding areas can be graded so that the rainwater flows towards the parks. Creating a gradual and imperceptible depression allows water to collect in the park and stay there long enough to infiltrate without giving the appearance of a stormwater facility. The depression should store water for no more than 24 hours. 
2205.3D 	Building Applications. All buildings in the SR-FBOD should strive to achieve a goal of zero net energy through best practices in design and construction practices such as governed by the Energy Star Program or the 
U.S. Green Building Council LEED Rating System. Some specific methods are as follows: 
1) 	Solar Orientation and Utilization. The use of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic techniques in the SR-FBOD is highly encouraged. Massing of buildings should be considerate of solar access to neighboring properties, particularly allowing sun during winter to properties immediately to the north. 
a. 	
Whenever possible buildings should be of a size and orientation to minimize the blocking of sunlight on public spaces such as sidewalks. 

b. 	
Windows should be oriented to make the best use of passive solar heating. 


c. 	
The primary roof plane should face as close to solar south as possible, to allow for installation or retrofit with solar panels. 

d. 	
Gable roofs and shorter buildings may be more appropriate on the south sides of a street while gable end roofs and taller buildings may be more suited for the north side. 

e. 	
Solar powered lighting should be used where feasible. 


2) 	Other Sustainable Building Design Techniques. There are many more opportunities to improve thermal envelope energy efficiency and use materials and equipment that reduce energy consumption in the SR­FBOD such as the following: 
a. 	
Natural cooling through appropriate glazing, shading of glazed surfaces, and operable windows. 

b. 	
Daylighting (using natural light as the primary source of general illumination). 

c. 	
Heat reflective roofs and pavement. 

d. 	
Wind power systems and roof-mounted solar energy generation. 

e. 	
Groundsource heat exchange (closed system geothermal energy). 

f. 	
On-site biomass use for energy production. 

g. 	
Renewable energy for heat and cooling 

h. 	
Combined heat and power systems. 

i. 	
Green walls and green blocks. 

j. 	
Increased insulation (e.g., R-26 and triple-glazed windows). 

k. 	
Energy Star rated appliances. 

l. 	
EcoStar or shared recycling programs. 

m. 	
Dual-flush toilets and waterless urinals. 

n. 	
Ultra-efficient heat and hot water systems. 

o. 	
Open and simple floor plans (i.e. square and cubes). 

p. 	
Improved building air seal (i.e. taped sheathing). 

q. 	
Graywater systems. 


2205.3E 	Local Food Production. To address sustainability issues such as open space conservation, self-sufficiency, improved nutrition, recreation, exercise, and reduced food expenses, the Town of Shelburne encourages small-scale agriculture to strengthen the local food system. Some techniques applicable in the SR-FBOD include the following: 
1) 	Community Gardens. A private, not for profit, or public common area used by a group of households to grow and harvest food crops or non-food crops for personal or group consumption or donation. 
2) 	Edible Landscapes. The utilization of plants and landscaping that produce edible food in settings that conventionally have been limited to ornamental or non-food producing plants. 
2205.4 	Signage Standards 
2205.4A 	Applicability. In the case of a conflict between this section and other requirements pertaining to commercial signage in the zoning bylaw, including in Section 1970, the requirements specifically set forth in this article will prevail. Noncommercial signage will be regulated under the provisions of Section 1970. 
2205.4B 	Intent. Within the SR-FBOD, signs should be clear and informative to the public, weather well, and be of a size, location, and form that fit the context of a given Character District. For example, signs within pedestrian-oriented neighborhood centers with slow-moving automobile traffic will differ fundamentally from other Character Districts. The further intent of these sign design regulations is to accomplish the following: 
1) 	Establish clear and improved standards for business identification. 
2) 	Assist property owners and business owners in understanding signage expectations. 
3) 	Encourage creative and innovative approaches to signage within an established framework. 
4) 	Promote commerce, vitality, identification and civic pride. 
5) 	Reduce sign “clutter” and unappealing appearances due to non-contextual design and low quality materials. 
2205.4C 	Sign Types. Sign types and dimensional controls are specific to individual Character Districts and are set forth in FIGURE 2205-T. A sign type not specifically identified will be construed as prohibited. 
2205.4D 	General Standards. All new signs, replacement signs, and modifications to existing signs must comply with the general standards stated. 
1) 	Signs may not be changed or installed until the AO, and if necessary the DRB, has approved the sign and a building permit (if applicable) has been issued. 
2) 	All signs should be architecturally integrated with their surroundings in terms of size, shape, color texture, and lighting so that they complement the overall design of the buildings. 
3) 	Signs should reflect the character of the building and its use. 
4) 	Signs should respect the immediate context of the building’s location and the overall character of the district 
5) 	Signs should enhance the primary design elements or unique architectural features of buildings. 
6) 	Signs should be designed with the purpose of promoting retail and street activity while enhancing the pedestrian experience. 
7) 	The size of a sign and its letters should be in scale with the façade and the sign should be located in a “signable area” which relate to the pattern of the facade. 
8) 	The number of signs per building facade should be limited to the fewest necessary to clearly identify businesses located within. 
9) 	The layout and shape of the architectural features of the building must be considered when determining the size and location of a sign. 
10) Sign messages must be designed to fit properly into the sign location. Modifications to logos and corporate identifiers may be required to fit attractively in the space provided. 
11) All signs are to be maintained properly such that they are always in clean, working condition and the copy is not obscured or damaged. 
12) New signs proposed for existing buildings must, where the applicant has opted to use the SR-FBOD, be required to meet the requirements of this section. Where existing signage will remain on buildings, proposed signs should be compatible in appearance with the existing signage in terms of size, color and general design. 
2205.4E 	Design and Material Standards. All new signs, replacement signs, and modifications to existing signs must comply with the design and materials standards stated below. 
1) 	Exterior materials, finishes, and colors must be the same or similar to those of the building or structures on site. 
2) 	Signs should be professionally constructed using high-quality materials such as metal, stone, hard wood, brass-plated, and exposed neon. 
3) 	Internally lit plastic letters, plastic box signs, or any other signs made of such materials are prohibited. 
4) 	The colors and lettering styles should complement the building facade and harmonize with neighboring businesses. 
5) 	The design and alignment of signs on multiple use buildings should complement each other such that a unified appearance is achieved. 
2205.4F 	Permitted Signs by Character District. FIGURE 2205-T below identifies the sign types permitted in the SR-FBOD. 
2205.4G 	Prohibited Sign Types. Unless specifically permitted by Character District development standards, the following sign types are prohibited for the SR-FBOD: 
1) 	Signs which move or give the appearance of moving, including pennants, streamers, string pennants, “garrison” size flags, and all other signs which flutter, undulate, swing, rotate, oscillate, or otherwise move by natural or artificial means. 

2) 	Signs and lighting which imitate, obstruct or cause confusion with official traffic signs, signals or markings, or emergency vehicle lighting. This does not include signs accessory to parking lots or driveways. 
3) 	Signs placed on or affixed to a parked vehicle or trailer where the apparent purpose is to advertise a product or direct people to a business. Mobile food vendors permitted by the town are excluded from this provision. 
4) 	Signs advertising or identifying a business or organization that is either defunct or no longer located on the premises. 
5) 	Electronic multiple message boards or screens. 
6) 	Off-premise signs. 
7) 	Devices other than a sign used to draw attention such as “dancing air men” or “inflatable figures.” 
8) 	Any signs that blink or flash. 
9) 	Any other sign not specifically authorized by this section. 
2205.4H 	Exempt Signs. The following are exempt from the SR-FBOD regulation: 
1) 	Flags bearing the officially adopted design of a nation, state, or political subdivision of a state. Flags must not exceed 30 square feet in area. 
2) 	Signs on storefronts displaying hours of operation or menus, not to exceed 1 square foot. 
3) 	Historic or interpretive plaques. 
4) 	Banner signs, wayfinding signs, gateway sign, public art and other treatments which are located within the street right-of-way that are properly permitted by the public entity with jurisdiction over the street. 
2205.4I 	Type Standards. FIGURE 2205-U establishes the standards for specific types of signs. 


2205.4J 	Special Signs 
1) 	Construction Signs. These signs must be no larger than 12 square feet and may remain up only while structure is under construction and no longer than a 1-year period. 
2) 	For Sale, Rent, or Lease Signs. These signs must be no larger than 8 square feet and may remain up no longer than a 1-year period. 
3) 	Non-Commercial and Political Signs. Non-commercial and political signs are subject to existing standards in Article XIX Section 1970.

In no case may this band be higher than 24 feet above the adjacent sidewalk. Wall signs must not obstruct the light into or vision to or from a window or door. In addition, wall signs: 
1) 	Should be located on the upper portion of the storefront, within or just above the enframed storefront opening. The length of the sign must not exceed the width of the enframed storefront. 
2) 	Must be placed within a clear signable area. Signable areas are defined as an architecturally continuous wall surface uninterrupted by doors, windows or architectural detail. 
3) 	The area of the sign must not exceed 15% of the area of the building facade (the exterior walls of a building exposed to public view). 
4) 	Must be mounted in locations that respect the design of a building, including the arrangement of bays and openings. 
5) 	Must not obscure windows, grillwork, piers, pilasters, and ornamental features. Typically, wall signs should be centered on horizontal surfaces (i.e., over a storefront opening). 
6) 	Must be designed to be compatible with the storefront in scale and proportions. 
7) 	Should be designed to create a clearly defined edge, provide shadow relief, and a substantial appearance. This effect is generally difficult to achieve by painting the sign directly on the building. For this reason, painted signs are discouraged. 
Standards. Blade signs must provide a minimum of 8 feet clear height above the sidewalk, and are to be hung from the front facade below the second floor windows of a multi-story building, or below the cornice line of a single story building. Blade signs must not extend more than 6 feet from the facade. Three-dimensional icon forms meeting these standards may be substituted for traditional flat blade signs. In addition, blade signs: 
1) 	Should be carefully designed to reflect the character of each building and business as well as fitting comfortably with other adjacent signage. 
2) 	Must not be mounted above the second floor window-sill in multi-storied buildings. 
3) 	Should incorporate visually interesting design elements such as square or rectangular shapes with painted or applied letters, 2- or 3 dimensional symbols or icons, irregular outlines, and/or internal cut-outs. 
Standards. Freestanding signs, monument signs and pole signs must be located and sized according to Character District standards. Freestanding signs, monument signs and pole signs must not be placed to interfere with pedestrian movement or vehicular movement or sight lines. In addition, Freestanding signs, monument signs and pole signs: 
1) 	Must not overhang public property and must be supported by 2 columns, 
uprights, or have a solid footing in or upon the ground. 

2) 	Should be constructed out of materials that complement the building structure and its use. 
3) 	Should be designed with features that complement the architectural lines of the building, especially with respect to the top of the sign. 
4) 	Should express high quality construction through design of the structure and the text. 
5) 	Should be composed of individual lettering that is consistent with the image of the business. 
6) 	Must be illuminated either by external fixtures designed to complement the appearance of the sign or internally illuminated such that only text and logos illuminate. Opaque backgrounds are required and must be of a non- reflective material. 
7) 	Must not exceed a maximum height of 8 feet, inclusive of the sign base.

3) 	Review Criteria. In making an evaluation of an application, the Administrative Officer and the Historic Preservation and Design Review Commission each will give consideration to the criteria set forth in paragraphs 1550.1-1550.6 of the Shelburne Zoning Bylaw. Before granting any approval, the Administrative Officer must determine that: 
a. 	
The scale and general size of the proposal is compatible with listed historic buildings, where compatibility is established through consistency in building height, width, street frontage, number of stories, roof type, facade opening (window, door, etc.) and architectural details; 

b. 	
The proposed exterior design is compatible with listed historic buildings, where compatibility is established through consistency in arrangement, orientation, texture, and material type; and 

c. 	
The proposal will not make the structure ineligible for listing on the National Register. 


2206.2B 	Density Bonuses. Development proposals on historic properties listed in FIGURE 2206-A will be eligible for density bonuses as specified in FIGURE 2206-B when the projects retain and do not alter any listed historic structures or, if such structure is altered, the alteration is approved pursuant to Section 2206.2A. Density bonuses may not be expanded through the merger of lots. 
2206.2C 	Density Reductions. Development proposals on historic properties listed in FIGURE 2206-A will be subject to density reductions as specified in FIGURE 2206-B when: 
1) 	Any listed historic structure or structures on the property has been neglected, altered or demolished (more than 5 years prior to the application) so it is no longer eligible for listing on the National Register; or 
2) 	A property owner demolishes or allows to be demolished any historic structure listed in FIGURE 2206-A within 5 years prior to filing an application under this SR-FBOD. 


2206.2D 	Demolition. Approval by the Development Review Board is required before any historic structure in FIGURE 2206-A may be demolished as follows: 
1) 	Applications. Upon submission of a complete application for the demolition of a historic structure listed in FIGURE 2206-A, the Planning and Zoning Department will initiate review of the request by providing notifications and scheduling discussion of the request at a meeting of the Shelburne Historic Preservation and Design Review Commission within 30 days. 
2) 	Review by Historic Preservation and Design Review Commission. The SHPDRC will meet and review applications for demolition under the criteria established below. Within 15 days after completion of the SHPDRC review, the SHPDRC will forward a written report and recommendation to the Development Review Board. The report will describe whether the proposed demolition satisfies the criteria below, and may include alternatives to demolition or removal of the structure. 
3) 	Review by Development Review Board. Upon receipt of a written report from the SHPDRC, the Development Review Board will meet and review applications for demolition under the criteria established below and will review the SHPDRC’s recommendation. The Board must render a decision within 45 days of the conclusion of the meeting at which the application is considered. 
4) 	Criteria. When considering a proposal to demolish a structure identified n FIGURE 2206-A, a reviewing body may approve, or in the case of the SHPDRC it may recommend approval of, the proposed demolition if it finds that the applicant demonstrates that: 
a. 	
Either: 

i. 	The structure proposed for demolition has deteriorated for reasons other than intentional neglect to the degree that no feasible alternative to demolition, including rehabilitation, preservation, or relocation, exists; or 
ii. 	The proposed redevelopment of the site after the demolition will provide a clear and substantial benefit to the community as a whole. 

b. 	
All historically and architecturally important design features, construction techniques, examples of craftsmanship, and materials, have been properly documented using applicable standards of the Historic American Building Survey and made available to historians, architectural historians, and others interested in Shelburne’s architectural history. 


5) 	Damaged Structures. If a structure for which demolition has been proposed has been damaged in excess of 70 percent of its assessed value due to flood, fire, wind, or other act of God, permission for the demolition may be granted by the Administrative Officer, without prior review by the SHPDRC or Development Review Board. It is the burden of the applicant to demonstrate that this requirement is met before 
the Administrative Officer may act. 
2206.3 	Prior Development Approvals 
2206.3A 	Applicability. An applicant may propose to redevelop a site with existing site plan, conditional use and/or PUD approvals under the provisions of this article. 
2206.3B 	Effect. An approval for redevelopment under the provisions of this article will supersede and replace any previously issued approvals. 
2206.3C 	Density. An applicant may propose redevelopment of a previously developed site that would increase the density of development on the site subject to site plan and/or conditional use approval as applicable. The applicant must demonstrate the existing development proposed to remain on the site (as calculated based on the formulas below) and the additional development proposed will not exceed the maximum allowed under the provisions of this article taking into account any density bonuses or reductions under FIGURE 2206-B. 
1) 	Residential. The density of existing residential development proposed to remain on the site will be calculated based on the minimum lot area requirements per dwelling unit for the existing building type(s) as shown in FIGURE 2203-C through FIGURE 2203-M. 
2) 	Nonresidential. The density of existing nonresidential development proposed to remain on the site will be calculated as follows: 
a. 	
For existing principal buildings with a footprint up to 7,500 square feet, the minimum lot area will be 7,500 square feet per building; and 

b. 	
For existing buildings with a footprint greater than 7,500 square feet, the minimum lot area will be equal to the building’s footprint. 


2206.3D 	Conditions of Approval. Any conditions of approval previously placed on existing development will be incorporated into the approval for redevelopment under the provisions of this article unless the applicant requests that a condition be altered or eliminated. The applicant must demonstrate that the condition(s) to be altered or eliminated conflicts with the dimensional or development standards of this article and that any proposed change to the condition(s) will be in conformance with the dimensional and development standards of this article. 
2207 	ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 
2207.1 	Intent 
2207.1A 	Administrative standards are intended to carry out the regulations and standards for the SR-FBOD and ensure these are effectively, fairly, and consistently applied in order to promote the general purpose and intent of each Character District. 
2207.2 	Applicability 
2207.2A 	Section 1900, Section 1910, and Section 2010 of the Shelburne Zoning Bylaws prescribe the process for review of site plan review, conditional use, and zoning permit applications. 
2207.2B 	Precedence. Where in conflict with the aforementioned sections of the zoning bylaws, and when an applicant has requested review under the SR-FBOD, the standards of this article will supersede Section 1900, Section 1910, and Section 2010. 
2207.3 	Projects Requiring Site Plan Review 
2207.3A 	Required. For property owners that have opted to use the SR-FBOD standards, FIGURE 2207-C specifies when site plan review is required, and which method of review is available. 
2207.3B 	Referral to DRB. The DRB, AO, DRB Coordinator, Planning Director, or the applicant may refer any project that requires site plan review to the DRB for review.

2208.6B 
1) 	Best Management Practice (BMP). A term used to describe types of water pollution control. Stormwater BMPs are techniques, measures or structural controls used to manage the quantity and improve the quality of stormwater runoff. The goal is to reduce or eliminate the contaminants collected by stormwater as it moves into streams and rivers. 
2) 	Bicycle Lane. A dedicated lane for cycling within a moderate-speed vehicular thoroughfare, demarcated by striping. 
3) 	Blade Sign. A sign oriented perpendicular to the face of the building.

5)  Building Lot. A building lot is a parcel of land either vacant or occupied that meets the requirements for the purpose of transfer of ownership or possession, or  for development.  
6)  Build-To-Line. A Build-To-Line is a line marking where the street-facing facade of a primary building must be located in some Character Districts.  
7)  Build-To-Zone. The build-to-zone is the area between the minimum and maximum setbacks from the edge of the right-of-way. It marks where the street-facing façade of a primary building must be located. Numbers on the Regulating Plan indicate the minimum and maximum distance in feet from the front property line / right-of-way line. A range distance is indicated by a dash (-), and street-facing facades may be located anywhere within this range. Projecting building elements may encroach beyond the Build-To-Zone as provided in the Building Form Standards.  
8)  Build-To-Zone Occupancy. A designated space on lots fronting a public street in certain Character Districts within which a percentage of the primary building facade, and where applicable, walls, fences and hedges, must be located. A 100% BTZ Occupancy means the entire width of the lot must be occupied by a building or qualifying wall, fence, or hedge.

Shelbume Rec:rutlon Facllltlea Impact Fee Program
October 18, 2001
The Town of Shdbume, Vermont, retained the services of Burnt Rock Inc., Associates in
Commnnity Planning. to assist with the prepararlon. of an. impact fee program to offset the
capital costs of m::reation facilities specifically nteded to an:ommodate popdarion growth.
This report ~Iains the statutory basis fur esablishing impact~ in Vermont, provides an
inventory of eristing and proposed teC1'1!3tion &o1ities> identifiei the level of service fur
various &o1fries, and describes the formuLae used to alcuLate the recreation &cilitics impact
fee.
Authority to Adopt Impact FH8
According to Vermont stature [24 VSA, Chapter 131 S5202], a DDJDicipa1ity desiring to levy
impact fees must meet the following requirements:
• be coufirm:d by the appropriate .rqiona] pl::1nning commission in aa:o.rdancc with 24
VSA Cb.apter 117 S-4350; and
• h2ve a duly adopted capiW budget and program.
. '
The ToWn of Shelburne has in p1"ce a Town Plan adopted April 13, 1999 which has been
app~ by the Chittenden County Regional Plonnfog Commission. In addition, the Town
last adbpted a C::lpital Budget and Program on September, 2®, which addresses capicd
facility needs through fiscal year 2005/06. Therefore, the Town is authorized Ullder statute
to levy impact fees.
Vermont statute also requires that impact fees be limited to ensure that the direct benefidaries
of new development pay o.aly their~ share of the cost of cap.ital projects. To this
end, impact fee,, must:
• be based upon a reasonable !ommla that will be used to ~ a fee that reflects the level
of service fur the capital project to be funded;
• be equl to or less ~ the ponion of the impact fee of a capital project that is
attributable to the development, and must not .include operation, administntt:ion or
maimenance costs;
• be used to fund the real cost of capiW projects, based upon cost projections, and any
payments beyond ::ICtUal costs are to be reimbuned to the payers;
• be es:peoded within m ye:ars of payment; and,
• be ::ldmi!'iSl'.C:n!d by a duly adopted ordinance or byJaw wh.K:h establishes a fommia fur
levying the impact fee.

In determining an appropriate fee, every effort was made to ensure that only the portion of
any .recreation capital project attributable to future development w:as used to calculate the fee,
and that such fee is based upon a reasonable level of service for each &cility. It is anticipai:M
that the Town will periodically evaluate the fee to ensure it~ real - rather than
estimated - p~ject costs, and to adjust the &cility standards as needed to meet future
community demand for .recreation &cilities.
Recreation Facllltles
Shelburne residents are proud of the high quality of .recrcat:ion programs and f.acilities
available to local residents. Presently, the town's organiz.ed youth programs, which include
soccer, baseball, softball, basketball and lacrosse, directly involve sevem hundred local
residents. The number of participants has grown steadily in recent ye:ars, phlcing pressure on
existing recreation &cilities. This prcs.rurc is apcaed to continue inacasing as the town's
population ezpands. ·
To dfress the growing dem;and for &cilities, and to anticipate future demmd 1ikcly to result
from ongoing population growth, an inventory of existing facilities was undertaken and a
level of service standud identified for each. These facility standards were prepared in
consultation with Town staff. In this way, existing and anticipated deficiencies may be
identifiec!, and costs may be fairly apportioned between existing and future ~idents.
Table 1 \includes an .inventory of existing recreation facilities owned and managed by the
Town of Shelburne, as well as the level of service for each facility. The level of service is
based upon the need for various facilities per every 1,000 residents. Finally, the table
identifies anticipated faality needs that will l'CSUlt &om projected population growth.
PROJECTED RECREATION FACIJN NEEDS
Table 1 shows the atent to which existing recreation faolities available to Shelburne
residents do not meet identified !tanduds, and the extent to which these deficiencies arc
projected to wo~ as a growing population continues to demand .recreation facilirir:s. It is
important to note, however, the difficulty in identifying service standards for individual
types of recreation fields (e.g., bascball/softlY.all fields). The use of fields for multiple sports,
shared use of support faalities (e.g. parking), changing recreation trends, and Shclbume's
VoL j_
Pagi;z S--10
Oar:rhei- 18, 2001
relatively small population, combine to make such .mmdmfs tmu.OUS. A more appropriate
me:ms of identifying currcm: deficiencies and futwe ueed.s is to consider the total area. of
developed public outdoor recre:ttion fac-,1jties (developed recreai:ion iidds), incJuding support
&cilities and site implOYCID:iltS, relative to W current and projected population.
According to ~ U.S. Cemus, the town's population was 6,950 in 2000. Ar. that time, the
town maintafoed 26.5 acres of improved tec:reation faciiitir.s in se9enl locations. Bated upon
a standard of 5.5 acres of improved, multi-purpose outdoor recreation facjlitjes per eRry
1,000 resident!, the town was deficient in outdoor .reaeation space by 11.7 acres. This
dc6cieiry is projected to increase to over 30 acres by 2020.
To address existing and projected deficiencies, the town has included three capit:al projects in
its Capital Budget and Program. One of these, the n!COnstructioa. of Davis Park Tennis
Courts, is to ~ emting needs and are therefore not eliwble for funding through impact
fees. Two other projects, howevea, are desigmd to accommodate future population. growth.
These arc: .
• Playing Fields Project, which includes land acquisitio.o aad site developmmt costs to
construct additional developed recreation fields. The project will .imolve the
development of twenty acres of new, improved reaeation fields and associated oo1irics
(e.g., .. parking, pla:ygrowld space), and will .imolve the aeation.·.of two additional
~ball/ softball fields and four additional soa:er/ multi-pwpose 6eLk. The anticipated
co~ of the project is $1,202,000, of which $360,000 is anticipued to be funded through
priVate donuions and $a.tl,OOO through a 20 year bond repaid through municipal
property tu: revenues and impact fees. {See ~draft Shelburne RecRuioml Fields
site plan in Appc:ndiz A).
• Bih/Pedestrian Path. Project, which includes the construction. of a 1.5 mile ('J,900')
section of .improved pathway from longmeacfow Drive to the Village Center. The
project is ~to be construcred in tluee phases at i total cost of $1,332,000, of whlch
$300,000 is anticipated to be funded through masportation grant prograim and
$1,032,000 through a 20 year bond to be repaid through m.imicipti property ta .revenues
and impact fees.
Impact F• Calculation
~ both projects described above are designed, in part, to addras future demand, an
analysis of specific costs and &cility capacities an be used to derermine an appropriate
method for ®daring an impact fee.
Pkv'iA& FicJ,f, Project; The Town lw proposed the acquisition of 20 acres of developable
bod as a .multi-purpose outdoor reaeation &cility. Conceptual plans for such a facility are
included in Appcwlix A of this report. Based upon the com:eptml plaos, the Town p~

an initial cost estimate of $1,202,000 for acquisitio~ site development and equipment cost
that will be required to maintain the new facility (only the cost of equipment purchase is
included in the estimate - ongoing operation and mainten;ance costs are not included).
& stated above, Shelburne owm and maintains 26.5 acres of developed recreation fields
(encompassing several non-contiguous pucels). Based upon the swuWd of 5.5 acres per
every 1,000 reSidents, the town is currently deficient in outdoor reaieation space by 11.7
acres. The 20 llCl'C parcel will correct this deficiency, and addll:SS projected &cility needs until
the year 2010.
The Town ezpects th2t approximately $360,000 of the total cost will be raised through
private fundraising. The remaining $8<f.2,000 will be repaid through a combination of impact
fees and the .issuance of a 20 year bond in 2006/2007 (fucal year 2007). As,,uming an interest
rate of 5%, the total cost of the bonded portion of the project will be $1,305,100.
Due to existing deficiencies in developed field space, a substanrial portion of this project is
intended to serve aisting residents. It is important that only that portion of the project that
is designed to serve demand stemming from population· growth be funded through impact
fees. The Town's facility standard is 5.S acres of improved outdoor .recreation space per 1,000
re.W:lents. Thus, the 20 acre facility is designed to serve 3,636 residents. The majority of the
space (12,acres, or 60%) is needed to correct existing deficiencies and serve currmt population
levcls. fbe remainder of the project (8 acres, or 40%) is designed to accommodate future
demand resulting from a projected population increase of 1,<f.55 resµlects.
Using these standards, the per person cost of the facility may be calculated as such:
Step l Determine the unit cost of the facility (e.g., the cost of each 1 a.ere of developed
recreation fields may be calculated as $1,305,100/ 20) - $65,255.
Step 2 Determine the cost of that portion of the &cilit:y needed to address future population
growth ($65,255 • 8 acres) - $522,0'40.
Step 3 Determine the cost, per user, of the new bcility needed to address future populAt.ion
growth ~upon the f.acility standard of 5.5 acres per 1,000 residents ($522,040 I
1,455 new residents) - $358.79/pcnon.
Bjkc:/Pedarrjm Path Project; The Town has proposed the apans.ioa.. of its aisting path
network through the construction of a 1.5 mile section of improved pathway from
Longmeadow Drive to the Village Center. The project is expected to be constructed in
three phases at a total cost of $1,032,000 (excluding anticipated grant funds), funded through a
twenty year bond to be repaid through municipal property tu revenues. .
The Town presently owns and m;aint:;iins 1.5 miles of multi-purpose path. The identified
level of service for recreation paths is 0.3 miles per every 1,000 residents, for a current need
VoL _L
Page§.'. .i2.!, I .:2.
OctDher 18, 2tXJI
for 2.1 miles of path, indicating a current deficiency of 0.6 miles. The multi-purpo2
.recreation path will bring the total path mileage to 3 miles, which will correct the curr=t
deficiency and addrea amicipated demand for paths until the year 2020.
The $1,032,000 will be funded through a 20 year bond to be repaid by a combination of
impact fees and property t:a revenues. Assuming the bond .is issued in fiscd year 2004 at a
me of 5%, the total cost of the project over the 20 year·bond period will be $1,599,600.
Again, it ~ import:lnt that impacc fees not be used to fund pro,P:is designed to address
existing &cility deficiencies. In this io.stiance, the Town's~ siandard is 0.3 miles of path
per 1,CX:O mtldems. Thus, the LS mile path is designed to serve S,000 residents - nearly half
(0.6 miles) being needed to addRSS tht! exi.¢ing ddicienc:y {2,000 penom).
The remainder of the path (0.9 miles) is designed to accommodate future demarvi resulting
.from a projected population increase of 3,000 new residents, which .is projected to occur prior
to the year 2020 - the final year for which population projections have been included. To
ensure that the fees are based on an equitable formula, impact fees must be based on. the
portion of the project that is attributabJc to DeW developmmt based upon the &cility
standard included in Table R-1.
Using the-se SWJdards, the per person cost of the .&cility may be ca.J culated as such:
~-
Step 1 'Determine the unit cost of the facility (e.g., the cost of each 0.1 mile segment of path
may alo.tated as .$1,599,600 I 15) - $106,640
Step 2 Derennine the cost of that poltio~ of the bcility .needed to address future population
growth ($106,640"' 9 (O.lmile segments) - $959,760.
Step J Determ.i.ne the~ per user, of the new &cility needed to address £unue population
growth baed upon the &cility standard of 0.3 miles per 1,000 resi,JeQtS ($959,760 ~

persons. Using these estimates, the impact fee for new dwelling units may be ala$tcd as
follows:
Single-family dwelling 2.75 pph: 2.75 • $678 .. $1,864
Multi-~amily dwelling 1.5 pph: 1.5 • $677 - $1,017
Calculating Property Tax Payment Credits
To ensure that the fee is equitable, statute rcquirrs impact fee formulae to ensure that
dwelling units which are assessed the impact fees are not charged twice. The raw land used
for new dwellings was assessed property taxes, some of which were used to offset the initial
bond issues. In addition, the new dwellings will continue to pay property taxes, some of
w~ will be used to offset the bond paymenu. In order to :1VO.id double paying, the impact
fee formulae must include provision for credits which reflect these past and future payments.
To this end, the stream of ax payments is broken into two parts - that which occurs before
the dwelling comes <;>nto the grand list, and occurring after the dwelling comes onto the grand
list. In the former case, prior to the payment of the impact fee, there will have been a series
of past ax payments made on raw land. In. the latter case there wi,11 be a stream of future ax
payment:S made on the new dwelling after the impact fee 'WllS paid.
~
Estimates were made of all annual capital expenditures (mduding bond payments of principal
and interest and annual capital expenditures) for the project! described above. In this case,
those payments arc limited to the annual payments requind to retire the two bonds
anticipated to fund the ballfields project and the recreation path. An estimated payment
schedule for the combined bonds is shown ·in Table R-22

For example, if the dwelling comes onto the grand list in fucal ·year 2006, the 2006 row of
Table R-3 indicates that the present value of tax payments used for the capital expenditures
will be $724.27 for single family dwellings and $362.14 for a multi-&mily dwelling. Again,
these credits must be deducted from the base impact fee.
Similarly, Table R-4 estimates the present value of past tu payments on raw hmd used for the
eligible capital expenditures, depending on the year in which the land .is convcrtCd to a
dwelling. The estimated mean value of raw land is based upon current property ;mecmncnts
for both improved and unimproved undeveloped Land in Shelburne.

Thus, if a dwelling comes o.nto the grand list in 2006, there will have hem prior tu
paylllellts used for the designQted projects. The 2006 row of Table R-i indicates that the
present value of those tu payments is $9.64 for a single f.amily dwelling and $3.+J for a multifamily
dwclµng. These amounts must be deducted &om or a.dited agaimt the base im.p:act
fee. Thus, for a single &mily dwelliog added to the grand list ill 2006, the recreation impact
fee is calculated. as follows: ·
$1,864 (base fee) . $124.27 (future payments). $9.64 (past paywents) - $1,130
Si11111arly, the fee for a multi-&mily dwelling wUt would be~ as:
$1,0i7 (base fee). $362.1-4 (future payments). $3.44 (pat payments) - $651

Shetbume VT Educational Facllltles Impact Fee Program Addendum
AddlUon of CW Expansion to Fee Schedule
Auaust 16, 2005
Introduction
In June 2002 the Town of Shelburne adopted an impact fee program to help fund educational
facilities needed to serve the Town's growing population. The fee, which is based on the planned
construction of a new middle school to serve grades 6-8, was explained in detail in the report
prepared by Burnt Rock Inc., Associates in Community Planning, entitled Educational Facilities
Impact Fee Program, dated June 21, 2002.
In 2004, the five municipalities that comprise the Champlain Valley Union High School (CVU)
District voted to expand the CVU facility; to accommodate a growing student enrollment and
address existing facility deficiencies. As a member of the CVU District, the Town of Shelburne
is responsible for a proportionate share of the costs of this expansion. These costs are eligible
uses for impact fee revenues. This report presents the analysis to establish the fonnulae for
levying impact fees for high school (grades 9 - 12) facilities.
Calculating an Impact Fee to Fund the CVU Expansion
As was the case with the fee established to partially fund the middle school project, the general
procedure for calculating the CVU Facility Expansion Impact Fee is:
I) Determine the per-student cost to the Town of new space designed to accommodate new
students, excluding the cost of space required to correct existing deficiencies;
2) Multiply the per student cost by the number of new students expected to be generated by
each new dwelling unit; •
3) Subtract estimated past and future tax payments used for debt service on the bond.
These calculations are described in the following sections.
The Cost of the CVU Expansion
CVU High School, located in Hinesburg, was constructed in 1968. In 1993 the facility was
expanded to accommodate a growing enrollmenL As a result of the 1993 expansion, the school
had a capacityof997 students. In May, 2003, district voters approved an $18,400,000 project
that included renovations and facility expansion. Funding for the project is to be shared between
the state, which is expected to pay 30% ($5,520,000) of the total cost, with the remaining
$12,880,000 to be paid by CVU member towns.
The $12,880,000 local share of the project was funded through a 20 year bond issued in 2003 at
an annual inte~ rate of 4.41 %. The total cost (principal and interest) of this project will be
$18,873,691. Analysis of the project conducted by the Town of Williston in association with the
CVU District indicated that 55.6% of the total cost was allocated to the renovation of existing
space, white 44.4% of the cost involved expanding the school's capacity. Thus, $10,493,772 of

Aup.rt JJ, 2005
the local share of the project is for renovation and is therefore ineligible to fund through impact
fees, while $8,379,919 was used to expand the facility to serve a growing student body.
~noted, prior to the expansion CVU High School's capacity was 997 students. The ap8Dlion
funded by the 2003 bond brought the total capacity to 1,410 students - an increase in capacity of
413 student spaces. Dividing the total cost of the project that l'e.9Ulted in expanded capacity
($8,379,919) by the nmnber of new students served by that increased capacity1 (413) yields a cost
of$20,290 per student space.
For the purposes of this study, the total cost to the Town of additional high school capadty
ii estimated to be $20,290 per studeat.·
CW Students Generated by New Dwelllngs
The Educational Facilitlu Jmpaet Fee Program report dated June 21, 2002 - which served as
the basis for Shelbume's current impact fee to partially fimd the development of a new middle
school - identified that single family homes in town arc estimated to generate 0.36 students in
grades k-8, while multi-family unitS2 arc estimated to generate 0.126 k-8 students.
Partly due to Shelbume's well regarded school system and quality of life, it is widely presumed
that most families with school-age families remain in the community for the duration of their
children's public education. Therefore, the number ofhigh-school students is estimated to be
44.4% of the number ofk-8 students. ThiY is based upon the k-8 grade being comprised of nine
grade levels, while 9-12 is only 4 grade levels, so that 44.4% ofk-8 students would be expected
to be in grades 9-12 over the counie of a single school year. This results in an estimated high
school generation rate of 0.1 S98 for single family dwellings and O.OS54 for multi-family
dwellings. •.
It should be noted that the student generation rates of dwellings may vary over the life of the unit.
It's been suggested, based upon anecdotal information, that newer units in Shelburne may be
more attractive to young families and th~fore have a higher generation rate. Impact fees,
however, must be based on the full life cycle of the dwelling, not the generation mte for the yems
immediately following construction. Thus, generation rates must be based upon the average for
the type of dwelling unit, exclusive of the dwelling's age.

ShelburM CYU ExpaMan Impact Fee Auprt 15, 1005
An analysis ofShelburne's grades k-8 and 9-12 enrollment for the past 10 years, however,
indicated that an average of7% oflocal k-8 students opt to attend a school other than CVU after
8111 grade. Therefore, the generation rate for high school students should be reduced to a factor of
0.93 to reflect the 93% ofk-8 students likely to attend CVU. Therefore, the generation rate for
single-family dwellinp is estimated as 0.1598 x 0.93 • 0.1486 and the generation rate for multifamily
dwelling units as 0.0554 x 0.93 = 0.05152.
For the purposes of this study, the high 11chool student generation rate ls estimated to be
0.1486 students for single family dwellings and 0.0515 students for multi-famUy dwellings.
Impact Fee Calculation
Using the facility cost figures and student generation rates, the per-student cost of that portion of
the CVU expansion designed to accommodate new housing development may be calculated as
such:
For single-family dwellings, the fee ls based on the cost of fadllty space per student
($20,290) multiplied by the nWDber of9-ll studenu per dwelling (0.1486) •
$3,015/dwelllng
For multi-family dwelllnga, the fee is based on the cost offacillty space per student
($20,290) multiplied by the number of9-ll students per dwelling unit (0.0515) =
$1,044/dwelllng
Calculating Property Tax Payment Credits
To CDSW"C that the fee is equitable, Vermont statutes require impact fee formulae to ensure that
dwelling units assessed an impact fee arc not charged twice. The raw land used for new
dwellings was assessed property taxes, some of which were used to offset the initial bond
payments. In addition, the new dwellinp will continue to pay property taxes, some of which will
be used to offset the bond payments. In order to avoid double paying, the impact fee formulae
must include provision for credits which reflect these past and future payments.
To this end, the stream of tax payments is broken into two parts: payments that occur before the
dwelling comes onto the grand list, and that occur after the dwelling comes onto the grand list.
In the former case, prior to the payment of the impact fee, there will have been a series of past tax
payments made on raw land. In the latter case there will be a stream of future tax payments made
on the new dwelling after the impact fee was paid.
Estimates were made of all annual capital expenditures (including bond payments of principal
and interest and annual capital expenditures) for the portion of the $18,400,000 project that may
be attributed to facility expansion (44.4% of the total, or $8,379, 919). Only a portion of this
amount, however, will be repaid by Shelburne taxpayers. CVU assesses member towns on an
annual basis based upon the percentage of total enrollment attributable to each town. In 2004,
S~lburne' s assessment was 28.5% of the total CVU budget. This was slightly down from the
Page3
Vol. - I '"
Page~ - 2.8
.4uprt Jj, 1005
prior year, but slightly above the average assessment over the past S years (27.9%). Given this
recent trend, and the lack of reliable long-term enrollment projections, for the purposes of this
analysis it is assumed that Shelburne will continue to contn'bute 28% of the cost of debt service
on the expansion bond.
An estimated payment scbcdu1e for the portion of the project dedicated to facility cxpaosion to be
repaid by CVU member towns, and a schedule for the portion of those payment's estimated to be
funded by the town of Shelburne, is shown in Table 1.

as descn'bcd above. For futW'e tax payments, it is necess8ry to estimate the prment value of futui:c
tax payments that will go to retire the bond issues. These payments will nm from the year that
the new dwelling enters the grand list (and begins making tax payments) to the end of tho bond
payment period.

Table 2 estimates the present value of future tax payments on new dwellings used for the eligible
capital expenditures, depending on the year in which the dwelling is constnlcied (and placed on
the grand list). The estimated mean value of new dwellings is based upon the assessed value of
dwellings constructed over the most recent five year period.
For example, if the dwelling comes onto the grand list in fiscal year 2007, the 2007 row ofTable
2 indicates that the present value of tax pa~ents used for the capital expenditures will be
$527. 72 for single family dwellings and $263.86 for a multi-family dwelling. Again, these
credits must be deducted from the base impact fee.

Similarly, Table 3 estimates the present value of past tax payments on raw land used for the
eligible capital expenditures, depending on the year in which the land is converted to a dwelling.
The estimated mean value of raw land is based upon current property assessments for both
improved and unimproved undeveloped land in Shelburne .

Using the same ca.ample as above, if a dwelling comes onto the grand list in 2007 there will have
been prior tax payments used for the designated projects. The 2007 row ofTable 3 uidicates that
the present value of those tax payments is $37.40 for a single family dwelling and $14.96 for a
multi-family dwelling. These amounts must be deducted from or credited against the base
