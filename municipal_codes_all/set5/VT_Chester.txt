ARTICLE 1 - AUTHORITY & PURPOSE
1.1 TITLE AND ENACTMENT
In accordance with the Vermont Municipal and Regional Planning and Development
Act (herein referred to as "the Act"), Title 24, Vermont Statutes Annotated, Chapter 117,
§ 4401, there are established zoning, subdivision and flood damage prevention
regulations for the TOWN OF CHESTER as set forth in their entirety in the following
text and maps. These regulations shall be known and cited as the "Town of Chester
Unified Development Bylaws."
1.2 PURPOSE
It is the purpose of these Bylaws to provide for orderly community growth; to promote
public health, safety and welfare; to further the purposes and goals established in the
Act [§4302]; to integrate all administrative and regulatory provisions of the Town's
zoning, subdivision and flood damage prevention regulations into a single set of land
use bylaws as authorized by the Act [§4419]. In conformance with the Chester Town
Plan, these Bylaws exist to:
A. Maintain the existing settlement pattern of compact village centers separated by
rural countryside;
B. Protect important natural and historical features, including woodlands,
wetlands, scenic and significant archeological sites, significant architecture,
villages, wildlife habitats and agricultural land;
C. Provide the availability of safe and adequate housing for all residents;
D. Promote a strong and diverse economy that provides satisfying and rewarding
job opportunities;
E. Maintain a safe, convenient, economic and energy efficient transportation
network;
F. Ensure that the rate and scale of development does not overburden the Town's
ability to provide necessary public services and facilities; and,
G. Establish flood damage prevention regulations in accordance with the Act
[§4424] in order to:
1. Minimize and prevent the loss of life and property, the disruption of
commerce, the impairment of the tax base, and the extraordinary public
expenditures and demands on public services that result from flooding and
other flood related hazards;
2. Ensure that the design and construction of development in flood and other
hazard areas are accomplished in a manner that minimizes or eliminates the
potential for flood and loss or damage to life and property;
3. Manage all flood hazard areas designated pursuant to 10 V.S.A. § 753; and,
4. Make the state, municipalities, and individuals eligible for federal flood
insurance and other federal disaster recovery and hazard mitigation funds as
may be available.

agreement, the provision of these Bylaws shall control.
E. All land development shall be subject to all other applicable local, state and federal
regulations.

2.4 Residential-Commercial (R-C) District
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
E. Supplemental Standards:
1. Character of Development. For the purposes of articulating the character of
development, this zoning district is broken into three sub-districts:
a) Chester Depot/South Main Street: New buildings and modifications of existing
buildings shall be of a similar building mass and orientation as buildings in
this sub-district, and shall not unduly detract from the existing character of
the Village. Where there are conflicts with existing adjoining buildings,
building modifications or expansions of uses shall not increase the degree of
conflict.
b) Gassetts: New development and redevelopment in this area shall continue in
the current moderate density, with a mix of commercial, light industrial and
residential uses. All new driveways and substantially reconstructed existing
driveways shall meet the Agency of Transportation's Access Management
Program Guidelines, as most recently adopted.
c) VT Route 103 South: new buildings and modifications to existing buildings
shall extend the historic pattern of higher density, mixed use village
development that includes single and multi-family dwellings, civic and
mixed use buildings (e.g., residential apartments over commercial
storefronts), and new public greens all interconnected via pedestrian paths or
sidewalks. The desired character of this area requires a shift from vehicleoriented
development allowed under the former Zoning Bylaws, to a more
pedestrian-friendly form of mixed use development. All new driveways and
substantially reconstructed existing driveways shall meet the Agency of
Transportation's Access Management Program Guidelines, as most recently
adopted.
2. Landscaping & Screening. The Development Review Board shall require
landscaping or other screening between incompatible uses or structures.
3. Rail Oriented Uses. No setbacks shall be required for railroad-related uses from
any lot line that abuts the Railroad.
4. Building Element. A Building Element is a single building or distinct portion of
a larger building conglomerate. No building element may be greater than 5,000
square feet in gross area. Any portion of the building element that will displace
precipitation shall be included in the square footage sum. Trellises, decks,
fixtures, banners, flags and their support structures shall not be included in the
square footage sum and shall comply with all other applicable Town Bylaws. An
attached building element must be displaced laterally from another by a
minimum of 15 % of the length of the larger building element common wall.
Building elements shall be configured and designed to comply with all other
district lot coverage, setbacks and applicable Unified Development Bylaw
restrictions.

A. Purpose:
The purpose of the Aquifer Protection Overlay (APO) District is to protect public health
and safety by preserving and protecting the municipal drinking water source from land
uses that pose a threat to ground water contamination within two designated subdistricts:
1. Primary Protection Area: Defined as the areas around the public water supply
wells. For the Jeffrey Well, the primary protection area is the 200-foot radius
source isolation zone. For the Canal Street Well, the primary protection area is
the area enclosed within a 200-foot radius circle around the well.
2. Secondary Protection Area: Established as the remainder of the APO not
included in the Primary Protection Area, but is necessary to ensure adequate
protection of public drinking water supplies.
B. Primary Protection Area:
1. Permitted Uses: The following uses are allowed within the Primary Protection
Area provided they meet the appropriate supplemental standards outlined in
Section 2.13E below and are designed so as to prevent any groundwater
contamination:
a. Parks, greenways, or publicly-owned recreational areas such as foot and
bicycle paths, playgrounds, ball fields and tennis courts.
b. Public drinking water supply related facilities, including the construction,
maintenance, repair, and enlargement of source, treatment, storage,
pumping, or distribution facilities.
c. Conservation efforts for soil, water, plants, and wildlife.
2. Conditional Uses: All other uses allowed by the underlying zoning districts
(unless specifically prohibited by the Vermont Water Supply Rule) are subject to
a conditional use permit, and must conform to the provisions of the underlying
zoning district and meet the performance standards outlined in Section 2.13E
below. Non-conforming uses may only be expanded to the extent permitted by
the underlying zoning district, and their expansion must conform to the
supplemental standards outlined in Section 2.13E and the Vermont Water Supply
Rule.

require a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator (see Section 7.2),
and must meet the supplemental standards outlined in Section 2.13E.
2. Conditional Uses: All conditional uses allowed in underlying zoning districts
require conditional use review by the Development Review Board (see Section
4.8) and a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator (see Section 7.2),
and must meet the supplemental standards outlined in Section 2.13E.
3. All uses: shall comply with the Vermont Water Supply Rule.
D. Dimensional Standards: Dimensional standards shall be as established for
underlying zoning districts.
E. Supplemental Standards:
1. Any facility or operation that involves collection, handling, manufacture, use,
storage, transfer or disposal of hazardous materials or hazardous wastes must
have a secondary containment system that is easily inspected and whose purpose
is to intercept any leak or release from the primary containment vessel or
structure. Underground tanks or buried pipes carrying such materials must
have double walls and inspectable sumps.
2. Open liquid waste ponds containing hazardous material or hazardous wastes
will not be permitted without a secondary containment system.
3. Storage of petroleum products shall have a secondary containment system or be
stored in a basement without floor drains.
4. All permitted facilities must adhere to appropriate federal and state standards
for storage, handling and disposal of any hazardous material or hazardous
waste.
5. All facilities or operations must prepare an acceptable contingency plan for
preventing hazardous materials and/ or hazardous wastes from contaminating
the shallow/ surficial aquifer should floods, fire, or other natural catastrophes,
equipment failure, or releases occur:
a. All facilities or operations shall include, but not be limited to a monitoring
system and secondary standpipe above the 100-year flood control level, for
monitoring and recovery. For above-ground conditionally permitted facilities,
an impervious dike, above the 100-year flood level and capable of containing
110 percent of the largest volume of storage, will be provided with an
overflow recovery catchment area (sump).
b. All facilities or operations shall include firefighting plans and procedures, a
fire retarding system, and provide for dealing safely with any other health

VSA § 6201(2), must meet setback requirements of the district in which the parcel is located.
3.19 NON-CONFORMITIES
A. Existing Nonconformities. Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the
authority of the Town of Chester to abate public nuisances or to abate or remove
public health risks or hazards. Any lawful lot, building or use in existence at the time
of adoption or amendment of these Bylaws may be continued. Such lot, building or
use shall meet all other requirements of these Bylaws, and is subject to the following
prov1s10ns.
B. Nonconforming Lots.
1. Any existing lawful lot that does not meet the specified dimensional requirements
in these Bylaws, may be maintained and developed for the purposes permitted in
that district as long as all other requirements for that district are met.
2. Existing Small Lots. In accordance with the Act [§ 4412], any lot that is legally
subdivided, is in individual and separate and nonaffiliated ownership from
surrounding properties, and is in existence on the date of enactment of this bylaw,
may be developed for the purposes permitted in the district in which it is located,
even though the lot does not conform to minimum lot size requirements of the
district in which the lot is located, provided such lot is not less than one eighth acre
or has a minimum width or depth dimension of at least 40 feet.
a. If an existing small lot subsequently comes under common ownership with
one or more contiguous lots, the nonconforming lot may be separately

configuration, provided such lot is not less than one eighth acre or has a
minimum width or depth dimension of at least 40 feet.
C. Nonconforming Structures
1. Any legal structure or part thereof, which is not in conformance with the
provisions of these bylaws concerning setback, height, size, or other structural
requirements (including such things as parking, lighting, buffers, and lowest floor
elevation in floodplain zoning) shall be deemed a nonconforming structure. Legal
nonconforming structures exist as a result of construction prior to adoption of
bylaws, or construction under an earlier set of less restrictive bylaws. Any
nonconforming structure may be allowed to exist indefinitely, but shall be subject
to the following provisions:
2. Subject to conditional use approval by the DRB, a nonconforming structure may
be restored or reconstructed after unintentional loss provided the reconstruction
is commenced within two years and does not increase the degree of nonconformance
that existed prior to the damage.
3. A nonconforming structure which has been demolished shall not be reconstructed
except in conformance with these bylaws. The DRB may grant a waiver from this
provision if a hardship would be created by rebuilding in strict conformance with
the requirements of these bylaws. In considering a waiver from these provisions,
the DRB shall take into consideration the ability of the applicant to use remaining
features of the property such as foundation, water supply, sewage disposal
system, underground utilities, etc.
4. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved, altered, extended, or enlarged in
a manner which will increase the existing degree of non-conformance.
5. The phrase 'shall not increase the degree of non-conformance' shall be interpreted
to mean that the portion of the structure which is nonconforming shall not increase
in size (or decrease in the event of failing to meet minimum standards such as
parking and lighting). Therefore, portions of a structure within a setback area
cannot be enlarged, portions above the maximum height cannot be expanded
where parking is deficient the number or size of spaces cannot be reduced, etc.
This phrase is not intended to prevent existing unfinished space from being
finished or other similar scenarios provided there is no increase in size.
6. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair
of a nonconforming structure provided that such action does not increase the
degree of non-conformance.
7. The DRB shall permit the alteration or expansion of a nonconforming structure for
the sole purpose of conformance with mandated environmental, safety, health, or
energy codes.

Page42
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
1. Any use, which does not conform to uses allowed in the district in which it is
located or is otherwise not in conformance with the provisions of these bylaws,
shall be deemed a nonconforming use. Nonconforming uses are those that exist
legally as a result of existing prior to adoption of bylaws, or permitted under an
earlier set of less restrictive bylaws. Any nonconforming use may be continued
indefinitely, but shall be subject to the following provisions:
a. The nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use
without approval by the DRB, and then only to a use that, in the opinion of
the DRB, is of the same or of a more conforming nature.
b. The nonconforming use shall not be re-established if such use has been
discontinued for a period of two-years or has been changed to, or replaced
by, a conforming use. Intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not confer
the right to do so.
c. The nonconforming use shall not be expanded, extended, moved or enlarged
unless the DRB finds that such expansion, extension, movement, or
enlargement does not increase the degree of non-conformance. Examples of
enlarged or expanded uses can include increased hours of operation,
increased numbers of tables, number of employees or an increase in the size
of the operation through the expansion of a conforming structure.
d. The DRB shall permit the alteration or expansion of a nonconforming use for
the sole purpose of conformance with mandated environmental, safety,
health, or energy codes.
3.20 OFF-STREET PARKING
Off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with this section in all

B. Non-Residential: The Development Review Board may require additional off-street
parking for any non-residential use if they find that minimum spaces are not sufficient.
C. Size of Parking Space: A parking space shall be at least nine (9) feet in width and
eighteen (18) feet in length.
D. ADA Accessible Parking: Any public building must provide for handicap parking,
and each handicap parking space must be at least thirteen (13) feet in width and
eighteen (18) feet in length, with a minimum 3 foot wide accessible route connecting to
the building in accordance with the ADA Accessibility Guidelines. Handicap parking
spaces will be so designated by appropriate signs.
E. Setbacks: Parking lot setbacks shall be a minimum of 5 feet.
F. Loading and Service Areas: In all zoning districts, other than the VC District, offstreet
loading space shall be provided for commercial, industrial or institutional uses
which will receive shipments in vehicles too large for a standard parking space.
Space provided shall be specifically for off-street loading and shall be large enough
to fully accommodate the maximum number of such vehicles expected to be on the
premises at any one time. Service areas may also be required for development
subject to conditional use review to accommodate emergency vehicles, waste
collection and disposal areas, transit service, or other purposes as may be
necessitated by the proposed use. All loading and service areas shall be clearly
marked and located in such a manner that parked vehicles will not block or obstruct
access or sight visibility at intersections.
G. Modification of parking requirements: On-site parking requirements may be
reduced by the Development Review Board under conditional use review, based
upon a determination that special conditions exist which warrant reducing the
minimum parking standard. The DRB may approve up to a 50% reduction of offstreet
parking spaces in Subsection A above. In the VC District, the parking may be
reduced beyond 50%, if warranted. When approving a modification of the parking
standards, the DRB shall consider the following:
1. Is the site located on or within 1,000 feet of a transit route?
2. Are there shared parking facilities with abutting businesses which are
sufficient to meet parking demand?
3. For mixed-use projects, do the proposed uses have staggered business hours
with minimal overlap?
4. Does the type of business proposed generate substantial pedestrian traffic, and
are adequate pedestrian facilities present?
5. Is a reduced number of parking spaces adequate due to mitigation efforts such
as bicycle parking, ridesharing or innovative measures (e.g. the provision of
transit passes or sponsoring car sharing for tenants/ employees)?

4.10 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
A. Purpose. In accordance with the Act [§4417], Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) are
allowed in the Town of Chester to permit flexibility in the application of land
development regulations for the purposes of Section 4302 of this title and in
conformance with the municipal plan. The purposes of the Planned Unit Development
in Chester are:
1. To encourage compact, pedestrian-oriented development and redevelopment,
and to promote a mix of residential uses or nonresidential uses, or both,
especially in downtowns, village centers, new town centers, and associated
neighborhoods.
2. To implement the policies of the Chester Town Plan, such as the provision of
affordable housing.
3. To encourage any development in the countryside to be compatible with the
use and character of surrounding rural lands.
4. To provide for flexibility in site and lot layout, building design, placement
and clustering of buildings, use of open areas, provision of circulation
facilities, including pedestrian facilities and parking, and related site and
design considerations that will best achieve the goals for the area as
articulated in the municipal plan and bylaws within the particular character
of the site and its surroundings.
5. To provide for the conservation of open space features recognized as worthy
of conservation in the municipal plan and bylaws, such as the preservation of
Effective 4/5/2017

4.10 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Page 69
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
agricultural land, forest land, trails, and other recreational resources, critical
and sensitive natural areas, scenic resources, and protection from natural
hazards.
6. To provide for efficient use of public facilities and infrastructure.
7. To encourage and preserve opportunities for energy-efficient development
and redevelopment.
B. Review Procedure. A PUD shall be reviewed by the Development Review Board
(DRB) concurrently with subdivision and conditional use review in this Article 4. In
addition to the conditional use, subdivision and site plan application requirements, an
application for PUD approval shall include a statement describing all proposed
modifications, changes or supplements to existing bylaw requirements. Modifications
of this bylaw approved by the DRB shall be noted in writing and appended to a plat
depicting the project to be filed in the Chester Land Records. All other provisions of
this bylaw not specifically modified shall remain in effect and be applicable to the
project.
C. Coordination with Conditional Use Review. Review and approval of a PUD
involving the development of one or more conditional uses under this Section shall not
exempt the proposed development from conditional use review. The DRB may review
and approve one or more conditional uses concurrently with granting PUD approval, or
may require the submission of a conditional use application, to include the terms and
conditions of the PUD approval, including any modifications of this bylaw granted in
accordance with this Section, at a later date.
D. General Standards. The modification of zoning regu_lations by the DRB may be
permitted in accordance with the following standards:
1. The PUD shall meet all applicable conditional review standards, and shall be
consistent with the Chester Town Plan and all other applicable municipal
regulations and ordinances currently in effect, including all local and state
regulations for sewage disposal and the protection of water quality.
2. The PUD shall represent an effective and unified treatment of the
development site, including provisions as appropriate for the preservation or
protection of surface and ground waters; wetland, stream bank, and
floodplain areas; significant topographic features, including hilltops and
ridgelines; areas of steep slope or shallow soil; significant resource lands,
including agricultural and forest land; historic or archaeological sites and
structures; natural and critical habitat areas; and open spaces, including
scenic views and vistas.
3. As a minimum requirement, each single family dwelling unit and each
conunercial building shall be hooked into the Municipal water and
wastewater system at the applicant's expense. The DRB may find and
Effective 4/5/2017 Page 70
ARTICLE 4 - DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES
4.10 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
conclude that this requirement is not reasonable for the proposed PUD
because of the distance to the Municipal systems and may be fulfilled by the
requirement that each owner-occupied single-family dwelling have its own
individual water well and septic system, which systems may be located in the
common area. Each individual system shall be the responsibility of the owner
of the individual unit or commercial building.
4. The DRB may allow for a greater concentration or intensity of development
within some section(s) of the development than in others, on individual lots
which are smaller than the minimum lot size for the district within which the
PUD is located, provided that there is an offset by a lesser concentration in
other sections, including the reservation of no less than 50% of the remaining
land as open space.
5. The minimum front, side and rear yard setbacks at the periphery of the PUD
shall be as dictated for the particular district unless otherwise specified by the
DRB. The DRB may allow other setback standards, such as zero lot lines, as
part of PUD approval.
6. Provision shall be made for the preservation of open space. Preserved open
space shall be dedicated, either in fee or through a conservation easement to
the Town, a community association comprising all of the present and future
owners of lots or dwellings in the project, or a non-profit land conservation
organization. The DRB shall approve such easement. Land held in common
shall be subject to appropriate deed restrictions stipulating the permitted and
restricted use of such lot, and establishing the person or entity responsible for
maintenance and long term stewardship. The DRB shall approve the location,
size and shape of lands set aside to be preserved for open space in accordance
with the following:
a. Open space land shall provide for the protection of identified resources,
including farmland, productive forest, wildlife habitat, natural areas,
aquifer protection areas, surface waters, stream banks, historic and
archaeological sites, and scenic views and vistas;
b. Designated open space may include the portion of a single lot which is
characterized by one or more of the above referenced features, or may
encompass the contiguous boundaries of the above referenced feature
located on multiple lots;
c. The location, shape, size and character of the open space shall be suitable
for its intended use. Generally, open space shall be at least 50% of the total
area for projects involving a parcel(s) of twenty-five (25) acres or more.
For smaller parcels, open space should be in proportion to the size and
scope of the project, and its intended use;
d. Open space shall be suitably improved and/ or maintained for its intended
use, except for open space containing natural or cultural resources worthy
of preservation that may be required to be left unimproved. Provisions
Effective 4/5/2017

4.10 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
Page 71
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
shall be made to enable lands designated for agriculture and forestry to be
used for these purposes. The DRB as appropriate may require
management plans for forests and/ or wildlife habitat. Areas preserved for
agricultural use should be of a size that retains their eligibility for state
and town tax abatement programs;
e. Open space land shall be located so as to conform with and extend
existing and potential open space lands on adjacent parcels; and
f. Sewage disposal areas and utility and road rights-of-way or easements,
access and parking areas shall not be counted as open space areas, except
where the applicant can prove, to the satisfaction of the DRB, that they
will in no way disrupt or detract from the values for which the open space
is to be protected.
7. Where a district boundary line divides a parcel, the DRB may allow the
development of a single PUD with a total density based on the combined
allowable density of each district.
8. Two (2) or more contiguous parcels under the ownership or control of the
applicant may be combined for review as a PUD. The permitted density on
one parcel may be increased as long as the overall density for the combined
parcels does not exceed that which could be permitted, in the DRB' s
judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots in conformance with district
regulations.
9. The total number of dwelling units shall not exceed that which would be
permitted in the DRB' s judgment if the parcel were subdivided into buildable
lots in conformance with the district minimum lot area required for single
family dwellings. However, the number of dwelling units allowed in the PUD
may, at the discretion of the DRB, be increased in accordance with the
following:
a. The DRB may grant a density increase of up to 25% of the allowable
number of units in instances in which a significant portion (50% or
greater) of the site is preserved as open space and/ or the DRB
determines that the PUD reflects an exceptional site design that will
result in the preservation of important natural resources and the
creation such amenities as pedestrian paths, parkland and/ or
playgrounds; or
b. The DRB may grant a density increase of up to 50% of the allowable
number of units in instances in which not less than 50 % of the total
number of dwelling units created are affordable housing units, as
defined in these Bylaws.

PUD shall not exceed the number which could be permitted in the DRB' s
judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots in conformance with the
zoning regulation for the district in which the project is located.
12. A PUD may include any permitted or conditional uses allowed in the district
in which it is located. Multiple principle structures and/ or uses on a lot, or
multiple ownership of a single structure may be permitted.
13. Principal buildings and mixed uses shall be arranged to be compatible, and
buffered as appropriate to ensure visual and acoustical privacy for the
residents of the development and for adjacent properties.

on the Preliminary Plat as a guide to the preparation of the Final Plat, which shall
be submitted for approval of the Development Review Board and for recording
upon fulfillment of the requirements of these Bylaws and the conditions of the
Preliminary Plat approval. Prior to approval of the Final Plat, the Development
Review Board may require additional changes as a result of further study of the
subdivision in final form.
5. Disclosμre of Subsequent Development Plans. Whenever an applicant submits
a proposal for subdivision that has the potential for further subdivision, the
Development Review Board will require a general indication of the intended
uses or a master plan of the remaining portion of land. Such an indication or
master plan shall include access, type of use, intensity of use and phasing.
B. Final Plat Review
1. Application and Fee. The Subdivider shall, within six months after the approval
of the Preliminary Plat, file with the Development Review Board an application
for approval of the Final Plat in the form described in Section 4.12(A)(1), using
the approved application blank available from the Zoning Administrator. If the
Final Plat is not submitted to the Development Review Board within six (6)
months after the approval of the Preliminary Plat, the Development Review
Board may refuse without prejudice to act on the Final Plat and require
resubmission of the Preliminary Plat. The application for Final Plat approval
shall be accompanied by a fee, as established by the Legislative Body, payable by
check to the Town of Chester, Vermont. One (1) original and seven (7) copies of
the Final Plat, a pdf copy and the original and one true copy of any offers of
cession shall be presented to the Zoning Administrator at least twenty one (21)
days prior to a regular meeting of the Development Review Board.
2. Study of Final Plat. The Development Review Board shall study the Final Plat to
see that it conforms in all respects to the requirements set forth during review of
the Preliminary Plat and that it responds fully, in its final form, to the
requirements of Section 7. The Subdivider, or his duly authorized representative,
shall attend meetings of the Development Review Board to discuss these issues.

3. Public Hearing. Within forty-five ( 45) days of the Official Submittal Date for the
Final Plat, the Development Review Board shall hold a public hearing at which
time the Subdivider, or his duly authorized representative, shall be present.
Notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance with§ 4447 of the Act and a
copy of the notice shall be sent to the Regional Planning Commission and to an
adjacent municipality in accordance with § 4414 of the Act.
4. Action on Final Plat. Within forty-five (45) days after the adjournment of the
public hearing, the Development Review Board shall approve, approve with
conditions, or disapprove the Final Plat. Failure of the Development Review
Board to act within forty-five (45) days shall be deemed approval. However, if
approved, the Plat shall not be signed by any member of the Development
Review Board until the Subdivider has complied with the provisions of Section
4.12(D) if applicable. Notice of this fact and of the Development Review Board's
decision shall be sent to the Subdivider by certified mail along with a statement
of the grounds for denial or conditions of approval supported by findings of fact.
A copy of the decision shall be sent to the Legislative Body, and also to the
District II Environmental Development Review Board.
5. Development in Sections. At the time the Development Review Board grants
Final Plat approval, it may permit the Plat to be divided into two or more
sections subject to any conditions the Development Review Board deems
necessary in order to insure the orderly development of the subdivisions.
The applicant may only proceed with a section of the approved Plat if said
section constitutes at least ten (10) percent of the total number of lots contained
in the approved Plat. In these circumstances, Plat approval on the remaining
parts of the Plat shall remain in effect for three (3) years or a period of time
mutually agreed upon, in writing and attached to the Plat, by the Development
Review Board and the Subdivider subject to compliance with Section 4.12 (D)(2)
and 4.12 (E) of each of these parts.
D. Public Investments
1. Public Investment Review. The Development Review Board shall, during its
review process, study the Subdivision Plat to determine the extent and adequacy
of planned public investments requisite in the interests of the public health,
safety, and welfare. When a proposed subdivision would have an extraordinary
impact upon the Town's existing public investments outside of the subdivision,
the Development Review Board shall require the Subdivider to assume or share
in the added financial burden on the municipality in an amount to be negotiated
with the Legislative Body.

Legislative Body as to form, sufficiency manner of execution and surety. A
maximum period of time, not to exceed three (3) years, which the Development
Review Board may determine appropriate, shall be set forth in the surety
contract within which the public investments must be completed. The contract
may also provide for reduction of the surety amount in proportion to satisfactory
completion of portions of the required public investments. If the public
investments are to be completed in phases, the surety amount need only cover
the cost of improvements for each phase, provided that the phases conform to
section of the Plat filed in accordance with Section 4.12 (B)(G).
3. Modification of Design Improvements. If any time before or during the
construction of the public investments it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Town consultant engineer that unforeseen conditions make it necessary to
modify the design of such improvements, the Town consultant engineer may
authorize modifications, provided these modifications do not constitute a waiver
or an alteration of the function of any improvements required by the
Development Review Board. The Town consultant engineer shall issue any
authorization under this section in writing and shall transmit a copy of such
authorization to the Development Review Board to be attached to the Final Plat.
Modifications which constitute revisions of the Plat shall receive Development
Review Board approval in accordance with Section 4.12 (E)(3).
4. Inspection of Improvements. At least five (5) days prior to commencing
construction of public investments, the Subdivider shall pay an inspection fee, as
established by the Legislative Body, payable by check to the Town of Chester,
Vermont, and shall notify the Town consultant engineer, in writing, when
construction of such improvements commence, so that inspection can proceed to
assure that all requirements of the Town of Chester Highway Construction
Specifications, the Town of Chester's Design Standards and Construction
Specifications, and any other bylaws are fulfilled during construction of the
improvements, and to assure the satisfactory completion of improvements and
utilities required by the Development Review Board.

ARTICLE 5 - SUBDIVISION STANDARDS
5.1 PLANNING STANDARDS
A. Character of the Land. All land to be subdivided shall be, in the judgment of the
Development Review Board, of such a character that it can be used for building
purposes without danger to public health or safety, or to the environment. Subdivisions
proposed for lands characterized by periodic flooding, poor drainage, incapability to
support structures, roads, and utilities; or other hazardous conditions, shall incorporate
special design provisions which reflect these limitations.
B. Flood Hazard Area. Subdivision improvements shall be consistent with the Flood
Damage Prevention Regulations in Section 4.11 and Article 6 of these Bylaws.
C. Lot Layout. The layout of lots shall conform to the requirements of the General Use
Standards in Article 3, and shall be appropriate for the intended use. Side lot lines
shall generally be at right angles to straight roads, or radial to curved road lines.
Consideration in lot layout shall be given to topographic and soils conditions. Irregular
lot layouts shall not be allowed, and excessive lot depth in relation to width shall be
avoided. A depth-to-width ratio of 3:1 shall normally be considered a maximum.
D. Preservation of Existing Features. Due regard shall be given to the preservation
and protection of existing features, trees, scenic points, brooks, streams, rock outcroppings,
water bodies, other natural resources, and historic sites.
E. Natural Cover. Land shall be subdivided and improved in reasonable conformity to
existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill, and to retain, insofar as
possible, the natural contours, limit storm water runoff and conserve the natural cover
and soil.
5.2 ROAD DESIGN
A. New Roads. All new roads, bridges, culverts and drainage ditches proposed to be
taken over by the Town of Chester and any section of a road, bridge, culvert and
drainage ditching located within the Town of Chester right of way shall conform to the

CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
B. Layout and Frontage.
1. The arrangements of roads in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation
of existing roads in or between adjacent properties in order to create a logical
system for convenient movement of traffic.
2. No land development shall be permitted on existing lots which do not either
have frontage on a public road or public waters or, with the approval of the
Development Review Board under subdivision review procedures, access to such
a road or waters by a right-of-way of record at least 50 feet wide. The
Development Review Board may approve a reduction in width to a minimum of
20feet provided that the drive serves only one lot and adequate, safe access will
exist with such reduced width. (See Rights-of-Way in Subsection H.)
3. Lot frontage requirements apply to lots served by private development roads as
well as lots served by public roads.
C. Street Names. All roads or streets shall be named subject to the approval of the
Development Review Board. Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the
Subdivider. The type, size, and location shall be subject to the approval of the
Development Review Board.
D. Access Road.
1. All access roads that intersect with a town highway are subject to an Access
Permit in accordance with the Town of Chester Road and Bridge Specifications.
2. Acceptance of private roads by the Town is subject to the approval of the
Chester Select Board pursuant to state law for the laying out of public rightsof-
way. Construction of roads to these standards in no way ensures such
acceptance. In the event the Select Board agrees to accept a road associated
with an approved subdivision, the terms of acceptance, including road
construction standards, inspection, and maintenance, shall be prescribed in an
agreement approved by the Select Board. Such agreement may be included as
a condition of subdivision approval, and such approval may specify the timing
of development on subdivided lots to ensure coordination with the terms of
the agreement between the Select Board and subdivider.
3. If the access road to the subdivision is a Class 4 road, the Subdivider shall be
required to improve the access to Chester Highway Construction
Specification standards under the approval of the Select Board.
E. Sidewalks. In subdivisions where the density is greater than one unit per acre,
sidewalks, or a right-of-way for future sidewalks, may be required on at least one side
of all roads by the Development Review Board. Sidewalks may be required in other
zoning districts where deemed necessary by the Development Review Board.

5.2 ROAD DESIGN
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
F. Pedestrian Access. Where necessary, in the judgment of the Development Review
Board, rights-of-way may be required to facilitate pedestrian circulation through the
subdivision or to provide access to public lands or waters.
G. Driveways.
1. All driveways that intersect with a town highway are subject to an access permit
in accordance with the Town of Chester Road and Bridge Specifications.
2. No parcel of land being subdivided will be permitted more than one access
point. Additional accesses may be approved in the event that:
a. The additional access is necessary to ensure vehicular and pedestrian safety;
or,
b. The strict compliance with this standard would, due to the presence of one
or more physical features (e.g. rivers and streams, steep slopes, wetlands),
result in a less desirable development or subdivision design than would be
possible with the allowance of an additional access; or,
c. A traffic management plan is developed in association with a planned unit
development approved in accordance with Section 4.10.
3. Driveways shall not exceed a 15 % grade, unless waived by the Development
Review Board.
H. Rights-of-Way. In accordance with 24 V.S.A. §4412(3), rights-of-way for any existing
lots that do not have frontage on a State or Town Highway require Subdivision
approval by the Development Review Board and must conform to the Town of Chester's
Road and Bridge Specifications. A right-of-way serving only one lot shall conform to the
driveway standards. Two or more lots not having frontage on a public highway shall
meet the road standards.
I. Dead Ends. Dead end roads are discouraged, but a suitable turnaround shall be
provided if a dead end cannot be avoided due to site conditions. In such circumstances,
turnarounds shall be provided at the termini of all dead ends, and the following
standards shall apply:
1. "T" or "hammerhead" configurations:

pedestrian rights-of-way, as required under these Bylaws, regardless of whether the
proposed right-of way is intended to be accepted by the town. In the event that the rightof-
way is not intended for acceptance by the town, the mechanism by which the right-ofway
is to be maintained, owned and/ or conveyed shall be clearly documented under
Section 5.5B.
K. Modification of Road Standards: In the case of unusual topographic conditions or
other circumstances which would make the strict adherence to these standards a
substantial hardship, not created by the applicant, the applicant may request a waiver
under Section 7.16. When considering such a waiver the Development Review Board
may modify the strict application of one or more of these standards providing the
applicant can demonstrate that the proposed road:
1. Is accessible by emergency response vehicles;
2. Does not pose any threat to the safety of motorists or pedestrians;
3. Will not result in unreasonable maintenance requirements for landowners; and
4. Is designed in a manner that is consistent with other applicable standards of
these Bylaws.
5.3 UTILITY DESIGN
A. Easements. The Development Review Board may require that utilities be placed
either in the road right-of-way between the paved roadway and road line or placed
horizontally underneath the roadway. Where inclusion of utilities in the road right-ofway
is impractical, perpetual, unobstructed easements twenty (20) feet in width shall be
provided with satisfactory access to the road.
B. Extension of Municipal Utilities. All subdivisions shall make adequate provisions
for water supply, storm water, and sanitary sewage disposal, and required utilities and
improvements. The Development Review Board may require the extension of public
waters and sewers to and within a proposed subdivision, without cost to the

applications for extensions to the municipal system shall be approved by the
officers and agents of the municipality entrusted with the care and
superintendence of the municipal water supply system.
2. The Development Review Board may require that a community water supply
system unconnected to municipal systems be designed in such a way that it may
eventually be connected to the public municipal water supply system.
F. Sewage Disposal Improvements.
1. For subdivisions which will connect to a municipal sewage disposal system,
applications for extensions shall be approved by the officers and agents of the
municipality entrusted with the care and superintendence of the municipal

and communication utilities shall be provided for all lots.
G. Fire Protection Facilities. Adequate fire protection (i.e. water supply or cul de sac)
within the subdivision shall be provided to the satisfaction of the Development Review
Board and the Fire Chief. Where practicable, fire hydrants shall be installed by the
Subdivider. The Development Review Board may require upgrades in order to provide
adequate fire protection for subsequent subdivisions.
H. Drainage Improvements. An adequate storm water drainage system for the entire
subdivision area shall be provided. The Subdivider may be required by the
Development Review Board to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface
water that may exist either previous to, or as a result of, the subdivision. A bridge,
culvert, or other drainage facilities located on a road proposed to be taken over by the
Town of Chester and any section located within the Town of Chester right of way shall
be designed in accordance with the Town of Chester Road and Bridge Specifications. Where
it is anticipated that additional runoff, incidental to the development of the subdivision,
will overload an existing downstream drainage facility so that there will be drainage to
private property or an increase in the expenditure of public funds, the Development
Review Board shall not approve the subdivision until provision has been made for the
improvement of said condition. Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course or
drainage way, there shall be provided a storm water drainage easement of such width
as to encompass the 25-year flood area of such water course, which easement shall be
indicated on the Final Plat. In design of the drainage system, natural waterways shall
be utilized to the fullest extent feasible. Natural drainage courses should be extended
across roads and not diverted into roadside drainage ditches.
5.4 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
A. Erosion Control. The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development. When land is exposed during development, the exposure
should be kept to the shortest practical period of time. Land should not be left exposed
during the winter months. Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/ or mulching
and structural measures may be required by the Development Review Board to protect
areas exposed during development.
B. Construction Requirements. Suitable fill material for any road, construction of the
proper subgrade of any road, removal of stumps and other fibrous materials from any
embankment, materials for and grading of embankments, side slopes in any
embankment and on roadside ditches, and finish grades on all slopes and roads shall

7.10 VIOLATIONS & ENFORCEMENT
The commencement or continuation of any land development that does not meet the
requirements of these Bylaws shall constitute a violation. The Zoning Administrator
Effective 4/5/2017
ARTICLE 7 - ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
7.10 VIOLATIONS & ENFORCEMENT
Page 104
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
shall institute in the name of the Town of Chester any appropriate action, injunction or
other proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate all violations.
No action may be brought unless the alleged offender has had at least a seven-day
warning notice by certified mail. An action may be brought without the seven-day
notice and opportunity to cure if the alleged offender repeats the violation after the
seven-day notice period and within the next succeeding twelve months. The seven-day
warning notice shall state that a violation exists, that the alleged offender has an
opportunity to cure the violation within the seven days, and that the alleged offender
will not be entitled to an additional warning notice for a violation occurring after the
seven days.
A violation of this Ordinance shall be a civil matter enforced in accordance with the
provisions of 24 VSA 1974(a) et. seq. and as described below:
A penalty of $100 shall be imposed for the initial violation of any provision of this
Ordinance. The penalty for the second offense within a one-year period shall be $250.00
and the penalty for each subsequent violation within a one-year period shall be $500.00.
As per statute, in cases where a violation is not contested, a "waiver fee" shall be paid in
the amounts of: $50.00 for the first offense, $125.00 for the second offense and $250.00
for each subsequent offense within a one year period. Each day that a violation
continues will constitute a separate violation of these Bylaws.
If the above enforcement strategy is not sufficient to deter violations, enforcement
proceedings may also be initiated pursuant to 24 VSA 4451, et. Seq. as they exist or are
hereafter amended or revised. These additional penalties may be up to $100.00 per day
(with each day constituting a separate violation), and issuance of injunctions.
For the purposes of Flood Hazard Prevention enforcement, if a structure is still
noncompliant after the opportunity to cure has passed, the Zoning Administrator shall
submit a declaration to the Administrator of the NFIP requesting a denial of flood
insurance. Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended,
authorizes FEMA to deny flood insurance to a property declared by a community to be
in violation of their flood hazard area regulations. The declaration shall consist of: (a)
the name of the property owner and address or legal description of the property
sufficient to confirm its identity or location, (b) a clear and unequivocal declaration that
the property is in violation of a cited State or local law, regulation, or ordinance, (c) a
clear statement that the public body making the declaration has authority to do so and a
citation to that authority, (d) evidence that the property owner has been provided notice
of the violation and the prospective denial of insurance, and ( e) a clear statement that
the declaration is being submitted pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968, as amended.

Effective 4/5/2017 Page 108
ARTICLE 7 - ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
7.13 NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW BOARD
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
the Development Review Board may grant a Variance and render a decision in favor of
the appellant, if all the following facts are found and the findings are specified in the
decision. The decision on an appeal for a Variance shall be rendered within forty-five
( 45) days of the date of the public final hearing.
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of these Bylaws
in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility
that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of
these Bylaws and that the authorization of a Variance is, therefore, necessary to
enable the reasonable use of the property.
3. That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
4. That the Variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or
permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property,
reduce access to renewable energy resources, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare; and
5. That the Variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum Variance that will
afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from these Bylaws
and from the Plan.
B. Variances to Flood Damage Prevention Standards. Variances shall be granted by
the DRB only in accordance with 24 V.S.A. §4469 and in accordance with the criteria for
granting variances found in 44 CFR, Section 60.6, of the National Flood Insurance
Program regulations.
1. Matters to be Considered in Variance Procedures. In passing upon such
applications, in addition to the requirements of said§ 4469, the DRB shall consider
all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these Bylaws , and:
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of
others;
b. The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
Effective 4/5/2017
ARTICLE 7 - ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
7.15 VARIANCE
Page 109
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
f. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage
and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
g. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the
community;
h. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
i. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not
subject to flooding or erosion damage;
j. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
k. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
I. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
m. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment of
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site; and,
n. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
o. Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of these Bylaws,
the DRB may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of these Bylaws.
2. Procedures for Variance Hearings. In addition to the requirements of 24 VSA
§4469, in considering variances to these flood hazard area Bylaws, the DRB shall
follow the following procedures, which include the procedures for the granting of
variances found in 44 CFR, Section 60.6, of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations:
a. No-Impact Certification within the Floodway. Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if any impact in flood conditions or increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. A No-Impact
Certification within the Floodway from A Vermont registered professional
engineer is required to satisfy this prohibition set forth in 44 CFR, Section
60.6(a)(1).
b. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvement
to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and
surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood
level, in conformance with the procedures set forth in 9B. 3, 4, 5 and 6 herein.
c. Variances shall only be issued when there is:
Effective 4/5/2017
ARTICLE 7 - ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
7.15 VARIANCE
Page 110
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
d. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
e. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and,
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property.
A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Zoning Administrator in the
Office of the Town Clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears
in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
f. The Zoning Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in
the community's annual or biennial report submission to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or State NFIP Coordinator upon request.
g. Historic Structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
"historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
"historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
h. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(1) The criteria of paragraphs 7.15(B)(2) (a) though (d) of this section above,
are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.

7.16 WAIVERS
A. Waivers for Subdivision Requirements. In accordance with§4418(2)(A) of the Act,
where the Development Review Board finds extraordinary and unnecessary hardship
may result from strict compliance with these Bylaws and/ or where there are special
circumstances of a particular Plat, it may waive portions of these Bylaws so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that such
waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Chester Town
Plan, or the municipal bylaws in effect.
In granting waivers, the Development Review Board may require such conditions as
will, in its judgment, secure the objectives of the requirements so waived. Such action
shall pertain to that particular subdivision and shall not set a precedent for similar
action relative to any other subdivision.
B. Waivers for Zoning Dimensional Standards. As allowed under 24. V.S.A. 4414(8), a
waiver of dimensional setbacks (front, rear and side yard requirements) from property
lines may be granted by the Development Review Board for any existing building
subject to the following provisions. Waiver requests are subject to the requirements and
review procedures under Section 4.8 for Conditional Uses.
1. Applicability. Waivers of dimensional setbacks are limited to:
a. Reduction to any required front, side or rear setback for legally existing
primary structures in order to accommodate:
i. ADA accessibility improvements;
ii. Life safety improvements;
iii. Unheated, open-sided additions (e.g. decks, stairways, entryways, etc.);
iv. Building systems (e.g. air conditioning, generators); or,
v. Renewable energy structures that could not be reasonably developed
without a waiver.
vi. To avoid encroaching into a seasonal stream buffer or to avoid building in
the Special Flood Hazard Area.
vii. In the event a property was rezoned in the October 8, 2014 Unified
Development Bylaws, the setbacks were made more restrictive and the
property has not changed ownership since the incorporation of said
Bylaws, the Development Review Board may allow the encroachment of
up to 10% of the setback dimension.
2. Review Criteria. The Development Review Board may approve a waiver
request upon finding that:
Effective 4/5/2017
ARTICLE 7 -ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
7.16 WAIVERS
Page 112
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
a. Granting a waiver will not result in an unsafe condition of the lot or to the public.
b. Incorporates design techniques (restricted height, lack of windows), screening
(fencing or plantings) or other remedies to reasonably limit impact or the
potential for impact upon the neighbors or public rights-of-way.
c. The waiver requested would not impair sight distances on or maintenance of
public or private roads or sidewalks.
d. The proposed work or construction does not encroach into the required front,
side or rear yard setbacks any more than necessary to accomplish the desired
results.
e. The proposed development is compatible in scale and design of structures and
· the overall existing development pattern of the surrounding area.
f. The waiver resolves a practical difficulty in developing the property and allows
reasonable use of the property;
g. In the case of historic properties, the waiver is essential to the preservation and
renovation of the historic building or the preservation of the historic pattern of
land use of the surrounding area.
3. Decisions & Conditions. The Development Review Board shall make its
decision on the request for waiver by applying the facts presented both in the
application and at the public hearing to the criteria listed herein. In approving a
waiver request, the Development Review Board shall determine and may impose
conditions to ensure that the waiver is the minimum required to afford relief and
represents the least deviation possible from the dimensional requirements.
These conditions may include, but need not be limited to, the following:
a. Limiting the size of the structure;
b. Requiring the mitigation of impacts to adjoining properties and/ or uses, to
public rights-of-way through building design (e.g. limiting window
placement), layout, landscaping or screening;
c. Reducing the encroachment into the required front, side or rear yard
setbacks;
d. Requiring that the project does not extend beyond an existing nonconforming
structure unless needed to accomplish the intended goal;
Effective 4/5/2017

7.16 WAIVERS
Page 113
CHESTER UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT BYLAWS
e. Reducing the waiver requested to ensure that the waiver represents the
minimum waiver that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation
possible from the zoning bylaw;
f. Controlling the location and number of vehicular access points;
g. Requiring site reclamation in the event the use of the renewable energy
structure(s) is discontinued for a period of 180 days. The site shall be restored
to its natural condition or returned to the site conditions prior to construction
of the facility;
h. Requiring the application to have professional site plans prepared by a
surveyor, engineer, architect or landscape architect licensed by the State of
Vermont.
4. Limitations of Waiver Approval. Any waiver granted under this section shall
be limited to the specific property to which it has been granted. A waiver on one
property shall not be construed as a general guideline or standard for any other
property.
7.17 PUBLIC NOTICE
A. In accordance with the Act [§4464 ], a warned public hearing shall be required for
