TELEPHONE COMPANY in the pursuit of its telecommunications business. The terms of this
Ordinance shall apply throughout the CITY, and to all operations of the TELEPHONE COMPANY

provision of telecommunications services in newly annexed areas upon the effective date of any
annexation.

for electric light or power wires or communications facilities or other systems not provided by the
TELEPHONE COMPANY to be attached to the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S poles or other
FACILITIES or placed in the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S conduit. If the CITY desires pole
attachments for electric light or power wires or communications facilities or other systems not
provided by the TELEPHONE COMPANY, or if the CITY desires to place communications
facilities or systems not provided by the TELEPHONE COMPANY in any TELEPHONE
COMPANY duct, then a further separate, noncontingent agreement shall be prerequisite to such

the CITY.
SECTION 7 - STREETS TO BE RESTORED TO PRE-EXISTING CONDITION

(b) The surface of any public street, avenue, highway, alley or public place disturbed by the
TELEPHONE COMPANY in the construction or maintenance of its telecommunications system
shall be restored within a reasonable time after the completion of the work to as good a condition as
before the commencement of the work. Should the CITY reasonably determine, within one year
from the date of such restoration, that such surface requires additional restoration work to place it in
as good a condition as before the commencement of the work, the TELEPHONE COMPANY shall
perform such additional restoration work to the reasonable satisfaction of the CITY. No public
street, avenue, highway, alley or public place shall be encumbered for a longer period than shall be
reasonably necessary to execute all work.
SECTION 8 - TEMPORARY REARRANGEMENT OF AERIAL WIRES

The right, license, privilege and permission is hereby granted to the TELEPHONE COMPANY,
its contractors and agents, to trim trees upon and overhanging the streets, avenues, highways, alleys,
sidewalks and public places of the CITY so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with the aerial wires, fiber or cables of the TELEPHONE COMPANY, and when so directed
by the CITY, said trimming shall be done under the supervision and DIRECTION OF THE CITY or
of any CITY official to whom said duties have been or may be delegated. In non-emergency
situations, three (3) days notice shall be given to the CITY where major new aerial facilities are
being constructed which require trimming work to be performed by the TELEPHONE COMPANY.
SECTION 10 - INDEMNITY
The TELEPHONE COMPANY shall indemnify and hold the CITY harmless from all costs,
expenses (including attorney's fees) and damages to persons or property arising directly or indirectly
out of the construction, maintenance or operation of the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S FACILITIES
located within the public RIGHTS-OF-WAY found to be caused solely by the negligence of the
TELEPHONE COMPANY. This provision is not intended to create a cause of action or liability for
the benefit of third parties but is solely for the benefit of the TELEPHONE COMPANY and the
CITY.
SECTION 11 - ADMINISTRATION OF ORDINANCE
(a) The CITY may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to this Ordinance and the
TELEPHONE COMPANY shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis by providing

SECTION 12 - COMPENSATION TO THE CITY
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 6 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
(a) As compensation for the use, occupancy, oversight, supervision and regulation of the CITY'S
RIGHTS-OF-WAY, and in lieu of and in full compensation for any lawful tax or license or charge or
RIGHT-OF-WAY permit fee or inspection fee, whether charged to the TELEPHONE COMPANY or
its contractor(s), or any RIGHT-OF-WAY easement or street or alley rental or franchise tax or
other character of charge for use and occupancy of the RIGHTS-OF-WAY within the CITY, except
the usual general ad valorem taxes, special assessments in accordance with State law or sales taxes
now or hereafter levied by the CITY in accordance with State law, the CITY hereby imposes a
Charge upon the Gross Receipts (as hereinafter defined) of the TELEPHONE COMPANY. The
amount of the Charge for the first year this Ordinance is in effect shall be $20,900.00. For the second
year the Charge shall be $28,700.00 increased by the Growth Factor as set forth in paragraph 12(c), if
applicable. For the third and subsequent years while this Ordinance remains in effect, the above
Charge is subject to adjustment by application of the Growth Factor set out in paragraph 12(c). This
adjustment for the Growth Factor will be made effective as of each anniversary date of this
Ordinance. In no event shall the Charge for subsequent years that this Ordinance is in effect be less
than the above amount stated for the second year of this Ordinance, except as provided in the case of
disannexation as set forth in paragraph 12(e), or as provided in Section 16 herein.
The TELEPHONE COMPANY will, according to tariff, bill such Charge to the customers billed
the customer service charges included within the term “Gross Receipts," as defined herein. Gross
Receipts, for purposes of this Charge, shall include only customer service charges which meet all
four of the following conditions:
(1) such charges are for TELEPHONE COMPANY services provided within the CITY; (2) such
charges are billed through the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S Customer Records Information
System ("CRIS"); (3) such charges are the recurring charges for the local exchange access rate
element specified in the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S tariffs filed with the PUC; and (4) such
charges are subject to an interstate end user common line ("EUCL") charge as imposed by the
Federal Communications Commission ("FCC").
The TELEPHONE COMPANY shall adjust its billings to customers to account for any
undercollection or overcollection of the Charge due the CITY.
(b) The Charge for each year shall be paid in four (4) equal payments. The dates shall be
February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, with the first payment under this Ordinance due
on the last day of the fifth month following the effective date hereof. In the event of any over or
undercollection from customers at the expiration of this Ordinance, the TELEPHONE COMPANY
may make a pro rata one-time credit or charge to the customer billing for affected customers who are
billed for a service included within Gross Receipts, as defined in paragraph 12(a). This will be
accomplished within 150 days following the date of expiration of this Ordinance. If however, it is
impractical to credit any overcollection to customers, then such overcollection shall be paid to the
CITY.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 7 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
(c) The Growth Factor shall be calculated by dividing the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S revenues
within the corporate limits of the CITY subject to state sales taxes ("Sales Tax Revenues") for the
twelve month period ending three (3) months prior to the next anniversary date of this Ordinance by
the Sales Tax Revenues for the twelve month period ending three (3) months prior to either the
initial effective date or the preceding anniversary date of this Ordinance as applicable. The Growth
Factor calculated by the method set forth in the preceding sentence, if greater than one, shall be
multiplied by the current year's Charge to determine the dollar amount of the Charge for the next
year. If the Growth Factor calculated above is one or less, the Charge for the next year shall be
equal to the current year's Charge. The TELEPHONE COMPANY will adjust its customer billing to
account for the Growth Factor calculated above.
Once the Growth Factor calculation is completed, the TELEPHONE COMPANY will provide
the CITY with the Sales Tax Revenues upon which the Growth Factor calculation was based.
The CITY agrees to rely upon audits by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts of state sales
taxes as reported by the TELEPHONE COMPANYwhich are performed in compliance with Sections
151.023 and 151.027 of the Texas Tax Code Annotated. The Growth Factor shall be recomputed to
reflect any final, nonappealable adjustments made pursuant to an audit finding by the Texas
Comptroller of an inaccuracy in the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S reports of revenues subject to state
sales taxes. The Charge shall be recalculated using the Growth Factor recomputed as specified in the
preceding sentence, and the recalculated Charge shall be used for all future calculations required by
this Ordinance. Any overpayment or underpayment resulting from such recalculation shall be
subtracted from or added to the first installment due the following year. If any overpayment or
underpayment shall be due during the final year of this Ordinance, then payment shall be made as
follows. In the case of overpayment by the TELEPHONE COMPANY, the CITY shall pay such
overpayment to the TELEPHONE COMPANY within 150 days following the expiration of this
Ordinance and, in the case of underpayment by the TELEPHONE COMPANY, the TELEPHONE
COMPANY shall pay such underpayment to the CITY within 150 days following the expiration of
this Ordinance.
(d) Such payments shall not relieve the TELEPHONE COMPANY from paying all applicable
municipally-owned utility service charges. Should the CITY not have the legal power to agree that
the payment of the foregoing Charge shall be in lieu of the taxes, licenses, charges, RIGHTS-OFWAY
permit or inspection fees, rentals, RIGHTS-OF-WAY easements or franchise taxes aforesaid,
then the CITY agrees that it will apply so much of such payments as may be necessary to the
satisfaction of the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S obligation, if any, to pay any such taxes, licenses,
charges, RIGHTS-OF-WAY permit or inspection fees, rentals, RIGHTS-OF-WAY easements or
franchise taxes.
(e) In the event that either (1) territory within the boundaries of the CITY shall be disannexed and
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 8 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
a new incorporated municipality created which includes such territory or (2) an entire, existing
incorporated municipality shall be consolidated or annexed into the CITY, then notwithstanding any
other provision of this Ordinance, the Charge shall be adjusted. To accomplish this adjustment,
within thirty days following the action effecting a disannexation/annexation as described
above, the CITY shall provide the TELEPHONE COMPANY with maps of the affected area(s)
showing the new boundaries of the CITY.
In the event of an annexation as described above, the Charge for the CITY will be adjusted to
include the amount of the payment by the TELEPHONE COMPANY to the existing incorporated
municipality being annexed. In the event that the annexed municipality had no ordinance imposing a
Charge or in the event of a disannexation, then the adjustment to the Charge will be calculated using
the effective date of the imposition of Local Sales Taxes as determined by the Texas Comptroller of
Public Accounts. The adjustment shall be the percent increase/decrease in the TELEPHONE
COMPANY'S Gross Receipts as defined herein for the CITY for the first calendar month following
the Local Sales Tax effective date compared to the last month prior to such effective date. This
adjustment to the Charge will be made on the first day of the second month following the Local Sales
Tax effective date and the adjusted Charge shall be prorated from that date through the remainder of
the payment year. The Charge as adjusted shall be used for all future calculations required by this
Ordinance.
SECTION 13 - ASSIGNMENT OF ORDINANCE
This Ordinance and any rights or privileges hereunder shall not be assignable to any other entity
without the express consent of the CITY. Such consent shall be evidenced by an ordinance which
shall fully recite the terms and conditions, if any, upon which such consent is given.
SECTION 14 - MUTUAL RELEASES
The CITY hereby fully releases, discharges, settles and compromises any and all claims which
the CITY has made or could have made arising out of or connected with Ordinance Number 83,
adopted August 29, 1962, and renewed or extended from time to time thereafter, and its predecessor
ordinances, if any, (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Ordinance 83"). This full and complete
release of claims for any matters under Ordinance 83 shall be for the benefit of Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company; its parent; its affiliates; their directors, officers and employees; successors and
assigns; and includes any and all claims, actions, causes of action and controversies, presently known
or unknown, arising directly or indirectly out of or connected with the TELEPHONE COMPANY'S
obligations to the CITY pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance 83. Southwestern Bell Telephone
Company, its parent, its affiliates, successors and assigns hereby fully release, discharge, settle and
compromise any and all claims, actions, causes of action or controversies heretofore made or which
could have been made, known or unknown, against the CITY, its officers or its employees, arising
out of or connected with any matters under Ordinance 83.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 9 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
It is the intent of the CITY and the TELEPHONE COMPANY to enter into the foregoing mutual
releases in order to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both the CITY and the TELEPHONE
COMPANY. This Ordinance and the mutual releases set forth in this Section represent a
compromise of each party's claims as well as each party's defenses, and is not intended to be and is
not an admission of liability or vulnerability by either party to the other with respect to either the
claims or the defenses asserted against the other.
SECTION 15 - REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES AND AGREEMENTS
Ordinance Number 83 adopted August 29, 1962, is hereby repealed; provided, however, such
repeal shall take effect at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the effective date specified in
the Section of this Ordinance entitled "ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT AND EFFECTIVE
DATE". All other ordinances and agreements and parts of ordinances and agreements in conflict
herewith are also repealed, which repeal shall take effect at the time and on the date specified in the
preceding sentence.
SECTION 16 - FUTURE CONTINGENCY
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance to the contrary, in the event that (a) this
Ordinance or any part hereof, (b) any tariff provision by which the TELEPHONE COMPANY seeks
to collect the Charge imposed by this Ordinance, or (c) any procedure provided in this Ordinance, or
(d) any compensation due the CITY under this Ordinance, becomes, or is declared or determined by
a judicial, administrative or legislative authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive,
unrecoverable, unenforceable, void, unlawful or otherwise inapplicable, in whole or in part, the
TELEPHONE COMPANY and CITY shall meet and negotiate a new ordinance that is in compliance
with the authority's decision or enactment and, unless explicitly prohibited, the new ordinance shall
provide the CITY with a level of compensation comparable to that set forth in this Ordinance
provided that such compensation is recoverable by the TELEPHONE COMPANY in a mutually
agreed manner permitted by law for the unexpired portion of the term of this Ordinance.
b) Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, the CITY and
TELEPHONE COMPANY agree that in the event this ordinance is submitted for review to any court
in which the currently existing case styled City of Port Arthur et al v. Southwestern Bell Telephone
Company, et al, Cause No. D142176 in the 136th Judicial Court, Jefferson County, Texas is pending,
the CITY and TELEPHONE COMPANY agree to take any and all actions reasonably necessary to
obtain approval and ratification of the ordinance by the court.
SECTION 17 - FUTURE AMENDMENTS
This ordinance governing street use may be amended at any time by the mutual agreement of the
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 10 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
CITY and the TELEPHONE COMPANY. It is understood that the TELEPHONE COMPANY is
currently in the process of negotiating similar ordinances with other cities throughout the state. It is
understood and agreed that if an ordinance governing street use with another city in this state
contains a provision which the CITY feels would be more advantageous to it than the terms hereof,
the CITY may require that that portion of this ordinance be reopened for negotiation. The intent of
the parties is that the City of Terrell Hills will be entitled only to treatment comparable to that which
was afforded under the ordinance with the other city giving due consideration to the contextual
meaning of the provision on which renegotiation is sought and the effect of the proposed amendment
on the meaning of the ordinance as a whole. Under no circumstance may an amendment result in a
higher level of compensation than that level produced by those methodologies utilized by the
TELEPHONE COMPANY to calculate compensation to other cities in Texas nor may an
amendment be applied retroactively.
SECTION 18 - GOVERNING LAW
(a) This Ordinance shall be construed in accordance with the CITY Charter and CITY Code(s) in
effect on the date of passage of this Ordinance to the extent that such Charter and Code(s) are not in
conflict with or in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States or the State of Texas.
b) This ordinance shall be construed and deemed to have been drafted by the combined efforts of
the CITY and the TELEPHONE COMPANY.
SECTION 19 - ACCEPTANCE OF AGREEMENT AND EFFECTIVE DATE
The CITY shall deliver a properly certified copy of this Ordinance to the TELEPHONE
COMPANY within three (3) working days of its final passage. The TELEPHONE COMPANY shall
have thirty (30) days from and after the final passage of this Ordinance to file its written acceptance
of this Ordinance with the CITY Secretary. This Ordinance shall become effective beginning the
first day of the quarter not less than thirty (30) days after its final passage by the CITY.

interest in this franchise shall be assigned, transferred, sold or disposed of and no sale, merger,
consolidation or transfer of controlling ownership interest in the Grantee shall be permitted without
the prior written consent of the City and then only upon such conditions as may be prescribed to

added thereto during the term of this franchise. The Grantee agrees to extend Cable Service to all
areas within the corporate limits of the City which have a housing density which is or becomes
twenty-five (25) dwelling units or more per street mile. The Grantee shall extend Cable Services to

months after the City notifies the Grantee that housing density in such area has reached twenty-five
(25) dwelling units per street mile in such areas.
SECTION 6. Use of Streets.
a. The Grantee shall have the right to use the streets of the City for the construction, operation
and maintenance of the Cable System as prescribed, regulated and limited by provisions of this
franchise and by local, Texas and federal law, as in effect from time to time.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 13 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
b. All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by the Grantee
within the legal boundaries of the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the
proper use of streets and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience
of property owners whose properties adjoin such streets.
c. In sections of the City where the cables, wires and other like facilities of public utilities are
placed underground, the Grantee shall place its cables, wires or other likes facilities underground.
d. The Grantee shall comply with all permitting requirements of the City, including the payment
of all permit fees and notice requirements, in connection with any proposed cut or disturbance of
City streets. In case of the disturbance of any street, paved area or landscaped area by the Grantee,
the Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City, replace and
restore such street, paved area and/or landscaped area to as good condition as before the disturbance.
If such restoration or replacement is not completed within thirty (30) days of the date of
disturbance, or if the completed work is found by the City to be unsatisfactory, the City may repair or
replace the inadequate work or complete the unfinished work and bill the Grantee for the cost of such
work, including but not limited to the cost of labor, materials, supervisions, and overhead. During
the term of this franchise, the Grantee shall maintain the integrity of any paved surface over the
Grantee's facilities, but only to the extent that such paved surfaces have been restored by the Grantee
or by the City on the Grantee's behalf.
e. If at any time during the period of this franchise the City shall elect to alter or change the
grade of any street or construct any other public works which will disturb the cables or other
facilities of the Grantee, the Grantee, upon reasonable notice by the City, shall remove, relay and
relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures, as the case may
be, at no expense to the City.
f. The Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the City or
the State of Texas, temporarily remove, raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings.
The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person
requesting the same, and the Grantee shall be authorized to require payment in advance. Such
payment shall not exceed the Grantee's cost. The Grantee shall arrange for such temporary wire
changes prior to the expiration of six (6) days from the date notice is given to the Grantee by the
person holding the moving permit.
g. The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging streets and
easements of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the
wires and cables of the Grantee, except that at the option of the City such trimming may be done by
the City or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the Grantee if the Grantee has failed
after two (2) weeks' notice by the City to perform such work. The City may at any time with the
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 14 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
Grantee's concurrence perform such work at the Grantee's expense.
h. If during the term of this franchise, the City grants approval of plats for new developments,
the City may notify the Grantee or advise the developer to notify the Grantee of the timing of
construction and location of trenching of rights-of-way and give the Grantee reasonable opportunity
to place cable in such trenches. The City will promptly provide the Grantee with copies of all plats
for new developments approved by the City during the term of this franchise.
i. If at any time during the term of the franchise, the Grantee's cables, wires or other equipment
or facilities should be damaged or destroyed, the Grantee shall promptly and (except for damage or
destruction resulting from the gross negligence of the City or its employees) at the Grantee's expense
and without cost to the City repair and restore such cables, wires or other equipment or facilities.
Nothing herein shall prevent the Grantee or the City from seeking recovery, reimbursement or
contribution from any third party which may have caused or contributed to the Grantee's or the City's
damages or expenses.
j. Whenever possible, the Grantee will bore, rather than trench, to minimize disturbance in
paved areas. The Grantee assumes responsibility for establishing to the City's reasonable

time period ending with the last audit period that reflected a deficiency in the Grantor's payments.

mutually agreed upon between the parties. Such an audit shall consist of a representation letter based
on an examination of the franchise fee payment schedule.

A. Grande will not grant any preference or advantage to any person, nor subject any person to any
prejudice or disadvantage as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations or other aspects of
its business practices. This does not prohibit Grande from establishing a graduated scale of charges
and classified rate schedules to which any customer corning within the classification would be
entitled. Grande will not deny access to cable service to any potential residential customer because
of the income of the customer or of residents of the area in which the customer is located. Grande

show its ability to operate and maintain Grande's facilities, its financial responsibility, and its ability
to comply with the terms of this Agreement.
Section 11. Payment of Franchise Fee to City; Audit.
A. General Compensation. The City Council finds that the City right-of-way to be used by Grande
in the provision of services in the City is valuable public property, acquired and maintained by the
City at substantial expense and obligations to City taxpayers. Without the rights granted by this
Agreement, Grande would be required to undertake substantial investments and obligations in
acquiring its own right-of-way and easements. Grande agrees to pay to the City as general
compensation a franchise fee consisting of three percent (3%) of Grande's gross revenue derived
within the City from cable service. It is the intent of the parties to include in the term "gross
revenue” the value of all consideration to Grande, cash and otherwise, that Grande derives from the
provision of cable service through and in connection with Grande's facilities, including:
1. all fees charged to Grande's customers for use of Grande's facilities;
2. all revenues generated from leasing Grande's facilities for the provision of services governed
by this franchise agreement.
3. advertising, including a prorata portion of national revenue attributable to Grande from the
operation of Grande's facilities in the City; and
4. sale or rental of customer lists.
"Gross revenue" does not include Grande's revenues from telecommunications services, nor does it
include revenue not actually received.
B. Calculation and Payment on a Quarterly Basis of Franchise Fee. Grande will make franchise fee
payments to the City each calendar quarter. Grande will make these payments to the office
designated by the City Manager by the 30th day following the close of each respective quarter.
Grande will make any necessary prorations. Each payment will be accompanied by a summary of the
data and calculations to support the amount of the payment, including a breakout by month.
C. The compensation in this section is in addition to all special assessments and taxes, including,
but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, right-of-way construction permits, inspection fees and
assessments for recovery of costs incurred by the City.
D. For any quarterly payment made after noon on the date due, Grande shall pay a late payment
charge of $100.
E. Grande's payment of compensation under this section does not limit or impair the privileges or
rights of the City, whether under this Agreement or otherwise. The City's acceptance of payment
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 32 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
will not be construed as an agreement that the amount paid is correct, nor will it be construed as a
release of any claim which the City may have.
F. Grande will file with the City Manager a statement of Grande's gross revenue for each fiscal year
not later than the 120th day after the end of Grande's fiscal year. The statement must contain a
detailed description of gross revenue and uncollectible accounts for the year.
G. Grande will keep complete and accurate records and books of accounts of its business and
operations in the City in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The City will
have the right to audit, inspect and copy all of Grande's books, accounts, maps and other records
reasonably required by the City to determine the amounts of franchise fee payments to be made by
Grande to the City.

and range and level of services, and Grande has the demonstrated ability and agrees, as expressed in

implementing improvements to Grande's facilities that are commercially feasible.
If the City Council elects to deny the extension of this Agreement, the City Manager will send
written notice of the reason for the denial to Grande by May 1, 2012.
C. The City Council may initiate a review of the performance of Grande under this Agreement at
any time. To determine satisfactory performance, the City will consider Grande's technical
performance, its customer service experience, and its compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

different time period set by the City Manager for good cause in the notice of default.
F. In the event the City terminates this Agreement, Grande will have 60 days from the date of receipt
of notice of termination to remove all of Grande's facilities from City right-of-way. The City may
remove and dispose of; or may assume ownership of and may use, any of Grande's facilities that are
not timely removed by Grande. The City may charge any costs for removal and disposal of Grande's
facilities to Grande.

Section 4.A. shall void this Franchise Agreement.
B. The Grantee may assign, mortgage or pledge its interest or equity in the Cable/Broadband
System authorized by this franchise, or any part thereof, in connection with the financing of
improvements or extensions to the Cable/Broadband System authorized by this franchise, or as a
general pledge of all the assets of its parent corporation, or those of its successors in interest, to
provide major funding for its parent corporation.
SECTION 5. Franchise Territory and Line Extension Policy.
This franchise shall be for the present territorial limits of the City and for any area hereafter
added thereto during the term of this franchise. The Grantee agrees to extend Cable Service to all
areas within the corporate limits of the City, which have a Residential Dwelling Unit density, which
is or becomes twenty-five (25) dwelling units or more per cable plant mile required to provide
service. The Grantee shall extend Cable Services to such areas and to areas annexed by the City
subsequent to the Effective Date within twelve (12) months after the City notifies the Grantee that
housing density in such area has reached twenty-five (25) Residential Dwelling Units per cable plant
mile in such areas.
SECTION 6. Use of Streets.
A. The Grantee shall have the right to use the streets of the City for the construction, operation
and maintenance of the Cable/Broadband System as prescribed, regulated and limited by provisions
of this franchise and by local, Texas and federal law, as in effect from time to time.
B. All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by the Grantee
within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 40 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners
who adjoin said streets. The installation and/or construction of above ground structures, lines and
equipment by Grantee shall require the prior approval of the City Manager for aesthetic and location
suitability, unless such structures, lines and equipment will be located on the same poles as existing
electric, telephone or other CATV plant facilities. City approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
C. In sections of the City where the cables, wires and other like facilities of public utilities and
other cable plant facilities are placed underground, the Grantee shall place its cables, wires or other
like facilities underground, now or in the future. In addition, if the City chooses to remove current
aerial facilities to be placed underground, Grantee will also be required to remove and place current
aerial facilities underground.
D. The Grantee shall comply with all permitting requirements of the City, including the
payment of all permit fees and notice requirements, in connection with any proposed cut or
disturbance of City streets. In case of the disturbance of any street, paved area or landscaped area by
the Grantee, the Grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City,
replace and restore such street, paved area and/or landscaped area to as good condition as before the
disturbance. If such restoration or replacement is not completed within thirty (30) days of the date of
disturbance, or if the completed work is reasonably found by the City to be unsatisfactory, the City,
after written notice to Grantee, may repair or replace the inadequate work or complete the unfinished
work and bill the Grantee for the cost of such work, including but not limited to the cost of labor,
materials, supervisions, and overhead if Grantee fails to repair or replace the inadequate or
unfinished work within a reasonable time. During the term of this franchise, the Grantee shall
maintain the integrity of any paved surface over the Grantee’s facilities, but only to the extent that
such paved surfaces have been restored by the Grantee or by the City on the Grantee’s behalf.
E. If at any time during the period of this franchise the City shall elect to alter or change the
grade of any street or construct any other public works which will disturb the cables or other
facilities of the Grantee, the Grantee, upon reasonable written notice by the City, shall remove, relay
and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures, as the case
may be, at no expense to the City.
F. The Grantee shall have the authority and duty to trim trees upon and overhanging streets and
easements of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the
wires and cables of the Grantee, except that at the option of the City such trimming may be done by
the City or under its supervision and direction at the expense of the Grantee if Grantee has failed
after two (2) weeks’ written notice to perform such work. City may at any time with the Grantee’s
concurrence perform such work at Grantee’s expense.
G. If during the term of this franchise, the City grants approval of plats for new developments,
the City shall notify the Grantee or advise the developer to notify the Grantee of the timing of
construction and location of trenching of rights-of-way and give the Grantee reasonable opportunity
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 41 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
to place cable in such trenches. The City will make available to the Grantee copies of all plats for
new developments approved by the City during the term of this franchise.
H. If at any time during the term of the franchise, the Grantee’s cables, wires or other
equipment or facilities should be damaged or destroyed, the Grantee shall promptly and (except for
damage or destruction resulting from the negligence of the City or its employees) at the Grantee’s
expense and without cost to the City repair and restore such cables, wires or other equipment or
facilities. Nothing herein shall prevent the Grantee or the City from seeking recovery,
reimbursement or contribution from any third party which may have caused or contributed to the
Grantee’s or the City’s damages or expenses.
I. Grantee’s use of City right-of-way will be subordinate to roadway, sidewalk and drainage
uses. If the City elects to install or alter the route, location, width or grade of any street, alley,
sidewalk, drainage, or related facility in a City right-of-way, Grantee will remove, relay or relocate
Grantee’s facilities that are affected at Grantee’s expense upon reasonable notice by the City. The
City will have the right to require Grantee to change the location of any of Grantee’s facilities at
Grantee’s expense when the public convenience requires that change, in the opinion of the City
Manager. In the event a City right-of-way is vacated or abandoned, Grantee will remove all of its
facilities from the right-of-way, and restore the premises without delay or cost to the abutting owners
or the City. If Grantee refuses or fails to remove, relay or relocate Grantee’s facilities after notice by
the City, the City will have the right to remove, relay or relocate Grantee’s facilities, and charge the
costs to Grantee, and any resulting interruptions in service to any of Grantee’s customers will be the
sole responsibility of Grantee. Grantee’s failure to pay any such costs to the City will constitute a
default by Grantee under this Agreement. Grantee will hold the City harmless for any damage to
Grantee’s facilities located in City right-of-way in the event Grantee’s facilities are damaged as a
result of construction or maintenance operations performed to the City’s roadways, sidewalks or
drainage facilities by the City or the City’s agents, employees or contractors.
J. Upon the determination of Grantee, whenever practical, the Grantee will bore, rather than
trench in the public rights-of-way, to minimize disturbance in paved areas. The Grantee assumes
responsibility for establishing to the City Manager or his designee reasonable satisfaction that
trenching, rather than boring, is the most practical means of equipment installation, taking into
account street construction and maintenance, due either to cost, maintenance or liability. The City
agrees that approval to trench will not be unreasonably withheld. The Grantee will perform work
involving the disturbance of paved areas following approval from the City Manager, whose approval
shall not be withheld or delayed unreasonably. The Grantee, upon prior notice before paving, shall
install conduit under street intersections during their construction and otherwise install cable during
the development of subdivisions to help avoid unnecessary subsequent cutting of streets.
SECTION 7. Franchise Fees.
A. In consideration of the grant of a franchise under this ordinance, the Grantee shall pay to the
City annually three percent (3%) of the Grantee’s gross revenues, defined as all revenues received by
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 42 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
the Grantee from all sources derived from or attributable to the operation of the cable television
system and the cable television connections authorized by this franchise, including but not limited to
installation fees, subscriber fees and pay television services but excluding any taxes or fees collected
by the Grantee as required by law and wholly transmitted to a city, state, or federal government.
Such payment shall be in addition to any other taxes, license fees or other fees or charges levied by
the City on the Grantee, or agreed upon contractually elsewhere in this franchise or by separate
agreement. The payment due to the City shall be computed and paid quarterly, based on the
Grantee’s fiscal year. The Grantee shall file with the City, within sixty (60) days after the close of
each of the Grantee’s fiscal quarters, a statement showing the gross revenues received by the Grantee
during the immediately preceding quarter and the amount of the franchise fee then due. Payment of
the franchise fee shall be remitted with such statement. A copy of the Grantee’s income statement
for the operation of the System herein authorized for the entire year, audited by an independent
Certified Public Accountant, shall accompany the fourth-quarter payment for each year.
B. Grantee agrees that if at any time during the term of this Franchise any court of final
determination rules that revenues derived from providing high-speed cable modem Internet services
over Cable/Broadband Systems is in fact a cable service, as defined by the rules of the Federal
Communications Commission, Grantee will, upon written request from Grantor, assess franchise
fees to subscribers receiving high-speed cable modem Internet services from Grantee and include
those assessed fees in other franchise fees collected and remitted to Grantor pursuant to Section 7a
herein.
C. The City shall have the right to inspect and audit the Grantee’s income records and the right
to re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under this franchise. An audit of any fiscal
year may be made at any time during the term of this franchise but limited only to the examination of
the Grantee’s books for the immediate preceding two (2) calendar years from the date of such audit
request. Any additional amount due as a result of such audit, together with interest at the maximum
interest rate permitted by law from the last day of the fiscal year from which such additional amount
is due, shall be paid to the City within thirty (30) days following written notice to the Grantee by the
City, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. The cost of such audit shall be borne by
the Grantee only if it is determined that franchise fees should be increased by three percent (3%) or
more of the City’s annual franchise fee received in the immediate preceding two (2) calendar years
from the date of such audit. The City shall have the right during the term of this franchise to conduct
a second audit examination of the Grantee’s books which may, at the Grantor’s option, extend to the
time period ending with the last audit period that reflected a deficiency in the Grantor’s expense by
an independent accounting firm to be mutually agreed upon between the parties. Such an audit shall
consist of a representation letter based on an examination of the franchise fee payment schedule.
D. Acceptance of any payment by the City shall not be construed as a release or as an accord
and satisfaction of any claim the City may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise
fee or for the performance of any obligation of the Grantee hereunder.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 43 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
SECTION 8. Liability and Indemnification.
A. The Grantee shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and all losses sustained by
the City on account of any tax, penalty, fine, costs, expense, suit, judgment, execution, claim or
demand whatsoever against the City resulting from the Grantee’s construction, operation or
maintenance of the Cable/Broadband System and/or any other negligent actions or omissions taken
or not taken by the Grantee in connection with this franchise. The Grantee may, and if requested in
writing by the City, undertake the defense of any claim, action or proceeding for which the City is
indemnified under this Section, and, thereafter, the Grantee shall not be liable to the City for any
legal or other expenses of the City other than reasonable costs subsequently incurred by the City at
the request of the Grantee in connection with the defense thereof. The Grantee shall not be liable for
the settlement of any such claim, action or proceeding effected without its prior written consent. The
City shall give the Grantee prompt notice of any claim, action or proceeding against it upon which
the City may seek indemnity hereunder.
B. The Grantee shall carry, throughout the term of this Franchise, personal and property
damage liability insurance with insurance companies qualified to do business in the State of Texas.
Such insurance shall show the City as an additional insured party. The amounts of such insurance to
be carried for liability due to property damage shall be $500,000 as to any one occurrence, and
against liability due to injury or death of a person $2,000,000 as to any one person and $5,000,000 as
to any one occurrence. A certificate or certificates of insurance shall be filed and maintained with
the City during the term of this franchise. The Grantee agrees that, at the end of the fifth and tenth
complete fiscal years following the Effective Date of this franchise, it will increase the amounts of
insurance required to be maintained by the Grantee under this Section 8.B. in accordance with an
opinion of a qualified insurance consultant agreed to by the City and the Grantee stating that such
amounts should be increased.
SECTION 9. Performance Evaluations.
The City Council shall have the right under this franchise at any time to review the performance
of the Grantee hereunder and to ascertain that all provisions of this franchise are being fully and
faithfully carried out. The City Council may conduct formal performance evaluations of the
Grantee’s Cable/Broadband System and the Cable Services on or about the fifth, ninth and thirteenth
anniversary of the Effective Date of this franchise. The City shall permit the Grantee to be involved
in and comment on establishing the method and format of such evaluation prior to the evaluation.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 44 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
SECTION 10. Revocation and Termination of Franchise.
A. The City shall have the right to revoke and terminate this franchise only if the Grantee has
(1) taken or permitted an act described in Section 14.C or committed material violations of this
franchise such as to indicate that the Grantee is unable or unwilling to comply with the material
terms of this franchise, and the Grantee has failed to take reasonable steps to correct or desist from
the violations within a reasonable time after due written notice has been given to the Grantee by the
City, or (2) if the Grantee files in any court a petition of voluntary bankruptcy or is involuntarily
adjudged bankrupt in any court of competent jurisdiction or is placed in receivership or trusteeship or
(3) if the Grantee’s title and interest in the Cable/Broadband System authorized by this franchise or
in this franchise is taken by judicial or nonjudicial execution or is forfeited or subject to forfeiture
before any court.
B. If at any time the City has reason to believe that the Grantee is in jeopardy of having this
franchise revoked and terminated for any reason, the City shall so notify the Grantee in writing, and
order the Grantee to show cause before the City Council within thirty (30) days of such notice why
such revocation or termination should not take place. If the Grantee fails to show cause, or in any
case if the City reasonably finds (1) that any of the causes set forth in Section 10a are applicable, (2)
that adequate notice has previously been given and (3) that the Grantee has failed to correct the
defects or violations as required, the City may, by majority vote of the City Council, declare this
franchise to be revoked and terminated.
SECTION 11. Customer Service Standards.
A. The Grantee shall maintain an office reasonably accessible to residents of the City who are
subscribers of the Cable/Broadband System and which shall be open during normal business hours,
have a listed telephone number and be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or
equipment adjustments may be received at any time. The Grantee shall provide for regular billing of
accounts.
B. The Grantee shall furnish to each new subscriber, at the time service is installed, a written
statement that clearly sets forth procedures for placing trouble calls or requesting equipment
adjustments, and an annual reminder that the subscriber can call or write the City if the Grantee fails
to respond to the subscriber’s request for installation, service or equipment adjustment within a
reasonable period of time.
C. The Grantee shall respond to requests for service on the same business day if the request is
received prior to 2:00 p.m. in the case of a system outage or service interruption. In no event shall
the response time for calls received later than 2:00 p.m. exceed twenty-seven (27) hours.
D. The Grantee may interrupt Cable/Broadband System service after 7:00 a.m. and before 1:00
a.m. only with good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations only
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 45 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
after giving notice to subscribers that Cable Service will be interrupted. Cable Service may be
interrupted between 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. for routine testing, maintenance and repair, without
notification, any night except Friday, Saturday or Sunday, or the night preceding a holiday.
E. Whenever service to any subscriber of the Cable/Broadband System is interrupted for any
period of time in excess of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, or the Grantee violates the service
standards then in effect recommended by the National Cable Television Association, and such
interruption or violation is known to the Grantee in addition to all other refunds and penalties due
pursuant to federal law or regulation, the subscriber, upon written request, shall receive a rebate of
one-thirtieth (1/30th) of his monthly subscription fee for each day or part thereof from the time
service is interrupted or service standards are violated until service is restored or corrected. For
purposes of this Section, “interruption of service” means that a subscriber is not receiving all
subscribed-for services.
F. The Grantee shall maintain records listing date and time of trouble and service complaints,
identifying the subscriber and describing the nature of each complaint and what action was taken by
the Grantee in response thereto. Such records shall be available for inspection by a representative of
the City at any time during regular business hours. Upon written request of the City, the Grantee
shall use its best efforts to develop a summary of such report for each fiscal quarter for inclusion
with the payment and report due under Section 7a.
G. The programming available on the Cable/Broadband System on the Effective Date are
identified on Exhibit A attached hereto. The Grantee shall file all changes in channel space
allocation and rates with the City at least thirty (30) days’ in advance of the effective date of such
change and shall provide customers of the Cable/Broadband System with at least thirty (30) days’
prior notice of channel space allocation and rate changes.
SECTION 12. Technical Standards and Reports.
A. Technical standards shall be maintained in compliance with Federal Communications
Commission Rules and Regulations 47 C.F.R., Part 76, Subpart K, as amended from time to time.
B. If, during the term of this franchise, Grantee develops, builds or obtains the ability to
provide other forms of cable television services not currently being provided, and such new services
are offered and provided to either residential or commercial subscribers in the City, and if such
services are subscribed to by residential or commercial subscribers, then, Grantee shall provide at
least one (1) service connection to provide such service to Grantor’s facilities as set forth in Section
18(a) herein. Provided however, that Grantee shall be under no obligation to continue to provide
such new service(s) to Grantor if Grantee ceases to offer or provide such new service(s) to either
resident or commercial subscribers in the City.
C. The Grantee shall advise the City with its quarterly report of any major changes in federal
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 46 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
and/or Texas law and regulation relating to the cable industry and any significant advances in
technology in the cable industry relating to the quality and quantity of services which may be
available and shall promptly inform the City of the implementation of any interconnect with another
Cable/Broadband System.
D. The Grantee shall arrange for its representatives to meet at least once each fiscal year with
representatives of the City to provide additional information, which the Grantee believes, is useful to
the City in connection with the Cable/Broadband System and to respond to inquiries from the City in
connection with the Cable/Broadband System and this franchise.
SECTION 13. Parental Control of Programs.
The City and the Grantee agree that public concern has been expressed regarding the reception
in subscribers’ homes of television programs that are offensive to some persons, that are intended for
viewing by adults and that are believed by some persons to be detrimental to the community’s
cultural values. Neither the City nor the Grantee wishes or intends to regulate the content of
television or radio programs, or any other services obtained from other sources and retransmitted
over the Cable/Broadband System. Nevertheless, the City and the Grantee agree that a public
interest exists and that there is a need for certain services to permit parents to exercise greater control
over the television programs watched by their children. Therefore, the Grantee agrees to provide a
locking device to any subscriber of the Cable/Broadband System, at the subscriber’s request, which
when locked electronically or by a key will prevent the television set from being tuned to any
channel designated by the subscriber. The Grantee shall have the right to charge an amount equal to
its cost of providing said locking device.
SECTION 14. Books and Records.
A. The Grantee’s books of account and records of its business and operations under and in
connection with this franchise shall be maintained and available at the Grantee’s office in San
Antonio, Texas.
B. The City shall have access upon reasonable advance written notice and at reasonable times
to review all of the Grantee’s books of account and records of its business and operations in Terrell
Hills to the extent reasonably necessary to enforce the terms of this franchise.
C. Any intentional false entry in the books of account or records of the Grantee or any
intentional false statement in the reports to the City as to a material fact, knowingly made by the
Grantee, shall constitute a major violation of this franchise. Unintentional errors in such books and
reports shall not constitute a violation.
SECTION 15. Severability.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 47 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
If any portion of this franchise is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction or is superseded or preempted by any State of Texas or federal law or
regulation, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and shall not
affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining portions hereof.
SECTION 16. Force Majeure.
When any provision or condition to be performed by the grantee under the terms of this
franchise is prevented, delayed or interrupted by lack of labor or materials caused by conditions
beyond the reasonable control of the Grantee, or by fire, storm, flood, war, rebellion, insurrection,
sabotage, riot or strike, or by failure of carriers to transport, make delivery or furnish facilities for
transportation, or as a result of some law, order, rule, regulation or necessity of governmental
authority, whether local, state or federal, or as the result of some law, order rule, regulation or
necessity of governmental authority, whether local, state or federal, or as the result of the filing of a
suit by the City against the Grantee (unless the Grantee is ultimately determined in such litigation to
have been in material violation of this franchise and Grantee has failed to cure such breach), in which
the Grantee’s franchise may be affected, or as a result of any cause beyond the reasonable control of
the Grantee, this franchise shall remain in full force and effect. The Grantee shall not be liable for
any breach of any express or implied covenant or obligation under this franchise when the same is
prevented, delayed or interrupted, provided that Grantee shall make a good faith effort to carry out or
complete, as the case may be, its duties and obligations hereunder in a timely manner.
SECTION 17. Regulation
The City shall automatically have all of the rights, benefits and powers granted to municipalities
under federal or State of Texas cable television laws or regulations in effect and as amended during
the term of this franchise, including specifically all powers or rights to regulate cable television rates,
services and programming, as if such laws and regulations were incorporated herein. Any other
matters permitted by such enactments or amendments shall be negotiated in good faith by the City
and the Grantee.
SECTION 18. Publicly Owned or Leased Facilities and Public Service Broadcasting.
A. The Grantee shall provide at least one service connection in each of the following locations:
5. all municipal buildings or facilities as may be now or hereinafter designated by the City
Manager or his agent;
6. all public and parochial school buildings as may be designated now or hereinafter by the
City Manager; and
Such service connections shall be provided to buildings as designated by the City Manager within at
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 4--Contracts
CHAPTER 48 4 CONTRACTS 4-28-03
least three (3) months of the date service is available to such building. In addition, a converter to
provide the capability of receiving basic and expanded basic service only shall be provided to each
such location. Connection and services provided hereunder shall be for public non-commercial use
only.
B. No charge shall be made by the Grantee for the installation, disconnection (when reasonably
requested) reconnection (when reasonably requested), monthly services and/or maintenance of
equipment authorized by Section 18.A., provided, however, Grantee shall not be required to make
such installations if line extension in excess of 300 feet would be required.
C. Grantee agrees to include in its Cable/Broadband System a regionally-operated Emergency
Broadcast System with the capability to introduce an audio and video message on the
Cable/Broadband System in times of public emergency, and to provide that such override may be
introduced from a City facility.
D. The Grantee shall provide locally-originated programming each week and shall meet or
exceed all such programming requirements or recommendations of the Federal Communications
Commission or applicable State of Texas or federal law or regulation. The Grantee may produce
such programming itself or may rely on local groups to produce such programming with technical
assistance from the Grantee. The Grantee agrees to permit the City, at its options, to participate in
the formation and operation of a broadly representative advisory board to help implement community
involvement in local origination production and use of public access channels. The Grantee shall
provide and maintain a studio in San Antonio, Texas or in another location at Grantee’s option
reasonably accessible to residents of the City for the purpose of local program production and
origination.
SECTION 19. Waiver
The waiver by either party of a breach or violation of any provision of this agreement shall not
operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of any provision of this
agreement. To the contrary, such conduct shall not be considered a waiver to either party to future
performance of any such provisions of this agreement, and the obligations of the parties to such
future performance shall continue in full force and effect.

the amount of three percent (3%) of CPS's gross receipts from the sale of electricity and gas within
the City. "Gross receipts" excludes uncollectibles. The payment for street rental shall be treated by

FLOOD.DOC 04-12-10
Sec. 8-1, Flood Damage Prevention
ARTICLE I
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS
SECTION A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
The Legislature of the State of Texas has in Sec. 16.315, Texas Water Code, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore,
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF TERRELL HILLS, TEXAS
as follows:
SECTION B. FINDINGS OF FACT
(1) The flood hazard areas of the City of Terrell Hills are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which
cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
SECTION C. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 8--Flood
2
FLOOD.DOC 04-12-10
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
SECTION D. METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood
waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
ARTICLE 2

person discharging storm water to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) or to waters of
the United States to determine if the discharger is complying with all requirements of this Chapter,
and with any state or federal discharge permit, limitation, or requirement. Dischargers shall allow the
City Manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and for the performance of any additional duties. Dischargers
shall make available to the City Manager, upon request, any SWPPP's, modifications thereto, selfinspection

records, reports, and other documents related to compliance with this Chapter and with any state or

clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make necessary arrangements with
its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the City Manager or his
authorized representative(s) will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of
performing his/her responsibilities.
b) The City Manager shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property, or require

conduct specified sampling, testing, analysis, and other monitoring of its storm water discharges,
and may specify the frequency and parameters of any such required monitoring.

borne by the discharger.
f) Unreasonable delays in allowing the City Manager access to the discharger's premises shall
be a violation of this Chapter.
Section 8-2.19. Inspection or Search Warrants
If the City Manager, or his/her authorized representative, has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this Chapter or any state or federal discharge permit,
limitation, or requirement, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this Chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community,
then the City Manager may seek issuance of an inspection or search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section, the City Manager, the Director of Public
Works, the Building Inspector, and the duly authorized representatives of these City departmental
Managers are declared to be "health officers," as that term is used in the Texas Code of Criminal
Procedure, Article 18.05.

42
FLOOD.DOC 04-12-10
this Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the City Manager may serve upon that person a written
Warning Notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the
discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending
discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the Warning Notice
in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt
of the Warning Notice. Nothing in this subsection shall require the City Manager to issue a Warning
Notice prior to taking any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action.
Section 8-2.21. Notification of Violation
When the City Manager finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the City Manager may serve upon that person a written
Notice of Violation. Within seven calendar days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the
violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of reoccurrence thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the alleged violator to the City Manager. If the
alleged violator denies that any violation occurred and/or contends that no corrective action is
necessary, an explanation of the basis of any such denial or contention shall be submitted to the City
Manager within seven calendar days of receipt of the notice. Submission of an explanation and/or
plan in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this subsection shall require the City Manager to issue
a Notice of Violation prior to taking any action, including emergency action or any other
enforcement action.
Section 8-2.22. Consent Orders
The City Manager may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance with
any provision in this Chapter or any order issued hereunder. Such documents may include specific
action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to this Chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
Section 8-2.23. Show Cause Hearing
The City Manager may order any person who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, to appear before the City Manager and show cause why
a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the alleged violator
specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the alleged violator show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified
mail (return receipt requested) at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 8--Flood
43
FLOOD.DOC 04-12-10
served on any authorized representative of the alleged violator. The hearing shall be conducted
pursuant to the rights and procedures specified in this Chapter. A show cause hearing shall not be a
bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the alleged violator.
Section 8-2.24. Compliance Orders
When the City Manager finds that any person has violated, continues to violate, or threatens to
violate, any provision of this Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the City Manager may issue an
order to the violator directing that the violator come into compliance within a specified time limit,
prior to commencement or continuance of operation, or immediately. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the MS4 and
waters of the United States. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established by a state or federal standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
Section 8-2.25. Remediation, Abatement, and Restoration Orders
When the City Manager finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, and that such violation has adversely affected the MS4, or
the waters of the United States, the City Manager may issue an order to the violator directing
him/her to undertake and implement any appropriate action to remediate and/or abate any adverse
effects of the violation upon the MS4, or the waters of the United States, and/or to restore any part of
the MS4, or the waters of the United States. Such remedial, abatement, and restoration action may
include, but not be limited to: monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of the adverse effects and
determination of the appropriate remedial, abatement, and/or restoration action; confinement,
removal, cleanup, treatment, and disposal of any discharged or released pollution or contamination;
prevention, minimization, and/or mitigation of any damage to the public health, welfare, or the
environment that may result from the violation; restoration or replacement of City property or
natural resources damaged by the violation. The order may direct that the remediation, abatement,
and/or restoration be accomplished on a specified compliance schedule and/or be completed within a
specified period of time. An order issued under this Subsection does not relieve the violator of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an order under this
Subsection shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against any
responsible party.
Section 8-2.26. Emergency Cease and Desist Orders
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 8--Flood
44
FLOOD.DOC 04-12-10
When the City Manager finds that any person has violated, continues to violate, or threatens to
violate, any provision of this Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past
violations are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) , or threatened violation(s), have
caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States
which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons or to the environment, the City Manager may issue an order to the violator
directing it immediately to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:
a) Immediately comply with all requirements of this Chapter; and
b) Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing
or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge. Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this Subsection shall
immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a
discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the City
Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the MS4 or
waters of the United States, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply, sewer
connection, or other municipal utility services. The City Manager may allow the person to
commence or recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City
Manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are
initiated against the discharger under this Chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence, to the City Manager within ten calendar days of receipt of the emergency
order. Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the violator.
Section 8-2.27. Stop Work Orders
Whenever the City Manager finds that any operator of a construction site has violated, threatens to
violate, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the City
Manager may issue a Stop Work Order to the operator, and require that a copy of the Stop Work
Order be posted at the construction site and distributed to all City departments and divisions whose
decisions affect any activity at the site. Unless express written exception is made by the City
Manager, the Stop Work Order shall prohibit any further construction activity, or any
commencement of construction activity, at the site and shall bar any further inspection or approval
by the City associated with a building permit, early grading release, or any other City approval
necessary to commence or continue construction or to assume occupancy at the site. Issuance of a
Stop Work Order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
violator.

when all such cases filed and pending under such ordinance or ordinances have been disposed of by
a final conviction or a finding not guilty or nolo contendere, or dismissal.
SECTION 5. Severability. That if any section, article, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word
in this ordinance, or application thereto any person or circumstance is held invalid or
unconstitutional by a Court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions of this ordinance; and the City Council hereby declares it would have passed
such remaining portions of the ordinance despite such invalidity, which remaining portions shall
remain in full force and effect.

(i) Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW
regional treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature
at the introduction into the regional POTW treatment plant which exceeds 40?C (104?F)
unless the regional POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such temperature.
Wastewater entering the City of Terrell Hills Wastewater Collection System cannot exceed
65.5?C (150?F) unless the quantity of heated discharge is of such volume that the manhole
does not exceed 40?C (104?F).
(j) Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.) released at a
flow and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or should have reason to know will
cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or, contain
concentration or quantities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen (15)
minutes more than five (5) times the average daily concentration, quantities, or flow during
normal operation.

enumerated substances in such quantities or concentrations so as to interfere with the operation or
performance of the POTW, the Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager, in conjunction with the
City Manager of the City of Terrell Hills, shall: (1) advise the users(s) of the impact of the indirect
discharge on the POTW; and (2) develop effluent limitation(s) for such users to correct the
interference with the POTW.
4.2 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. After the promulgation of the Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standard for a particular industrial subcategory, and upon expiration of any
compliance grace period, the Federal Standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this
ordinance for sources in that subcategory, shall supersede and replace the limitations imposed under
this ordinance for that particular industrial subcategory. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
that are more stringent than limitations imposed under this ordinance for sources in a particular
industrial subcategory, and are already in existence at the time this ordinance becomes effective,
shall also supersede and replace the limitations imposed under this ordinance as they apply to the
particular industrial subcategory so regulated. The Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager, in
conjunction with the City Manager of the City of Terrell Hills shall notify all affected users of the
modified applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Part 403, Section 403.12.
4.3 Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the City of San Antonio
regional wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by Federal
Pretreatment Standards, the City of San Antonio may apply to the Approval Authority for
modification of specific limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards. "Consistent removal" shall
mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the regional
wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the
system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40
CFR, Part 403, Section 403.7(c)(2), "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New
Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to the Act. The City of Terrell Hills may modify
pollutant discharge limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in the

ordinance when the State requirements are more stringent than either the Federal or City of Terrell
Hills standards and requirements.
4.6 Right of Revision. The City of Terrell Hills reserves the right to amend this ordinance at
any time to establish more stringent specific pollutant limitations or requirements on indirect
discharges to the Wastewater Collection System if deemed necessary by the City of Terrell Hills to
protect the regional POTW processes or to cure or prevent a regional effluent quality problem in
treated wastewater and/or resulting sludges. The City of Terrell Hills reserves the right to amend this
ordinance to comply with the general objectives and purposes presented in Section 2 of this
ordinance.
4.7 Prohibition of Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, unpolluted
water, surface water or stormwater or in any other way attempt to dilute either a direct or indirect
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
specific pollutant limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any
other specific pollutant limitations promulgated by the City of Terrell Hills and/or State and
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 11--Real Property

6.3 Monitoring Facilities. The City of Terrell Hills, in conjunction with the City of San Antonio
may require monitoring facilities that allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the
discharge point and/or internal drainage systems located on private property. These facilities shall be
provided by the user and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user's premises, but the City of Terrell Hills may, when such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not create a public safety hazard nor be obstructed
by structures, landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to safely allow for
inspection personnel to position sampling equipment and prepare field samples for analysis.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be
provided in accordance with the Regional System requirements and all applicable local construction
standards and specifications.
6.4 Inspection and Sampling. The City of San Antonio Industrial Waste Subsection personnel
are hereby delegated authority to inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of
this ordinance is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Employers and employees
of premises where industrial wastewater is generated or discharged shall allow authorized City of
San Antonio representatives displaying proper identification ready access to the premises at all
reasonable times for the purpose of: inspecting wastewater generating operations and processes;
wastewater flow monitoring and sampling; and examination of business records pertinent to
wastewater volume and quality. Where a user has safety and/or security measures in force which
require user issuance of special safety equipment and/or proper identification and clearance before
allowing entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security
guards or similar personnel, so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the
City of Terrell Hills, the City of San Antonio, the State, or EPA will be permitted to enter, without
delay, for the purpose of performing responsibilities reasonably associated with those stated above
and reasonably required to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this ordinance.
Concentration and constituent analyses of wastewater from samples collected from any industrial
user may be determined by the City of San Antonio or its authorized agent, the Approving Authority,
a Registered Professional Engineer contracted by the discharger, or by any other qualified party
approved by the City of San Antonio. If the discharger elects to contract with a Registered
Professional Engineer for sampling and analysis of wastewater, the report submitted should contain a
statement that the samples collected and values determined are based on daily composite sampling
representative of the establishment's flow. The volume of wastewater may be determined by
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 11--Real Property
35 01-29-14
methods similar to those typically used to calculate monthly "general service customer" sewer
service charges in the City of San Antonio.
6.5 Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with
this ordinance and to achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within
compliance schedule requirements as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any
facilities required to pretreat wastewater to quality Standards required by the City of Terrell Hills, in
conjunction with input from the City of San Antonio or Approving Authority shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities
and an outline of the pretreatment facility operating procedures shall be prepared by a Registered
Professional Engineer and submitted to the Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager for review. All
plans shall be approved by the Regional Manager before construction of the facility. The user shall
insure that construction of said treatment facility is accomplished within the time period specified by
the Regional Manager. A schedule for completion with periodic progress reports may be required.
The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from
the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City
of Terrell Hills under the provisions of this ordinance. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or their method of operation shall be reported to and be reviewed for approval by the
Regional Manager prior to the user's initiation of the changes. All records relating to compliance
with Pretreatment Standards shall be made available to officials of the City of Terrell Hills, City of
San Antonio, the EPA or the State of Texas upon request and shall be retained by the user for a
minimum of three (3) years or until any ongoing litigation involving the pretreating user, and related
to compliance with this ordinance, has been resolved.
6.5.1 Initial Compliance Report. Within thirty (30) days following the initial date required,
pretreatment facilities are operational, or required modification of production processes affecting the
quality of wastewater discharge are complete, or, in the case of a new source, the commencement of
the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements shall submit to the Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager a report indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are
limited by Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. The report will include average and maximum
daily flows for these process units in the user facilities which are limited by such Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and
maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into Compliance with the applicable
Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the industrial user, and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer. For
industrial users not falling under Categorical Standards, certain reporting requirements may be
modified as deemed appropriate.
6.5.2 Periodic Compliance Reports.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 11--Real Property
36 01-29-14
(1) Any user subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard requiring pretreatment facilities
shall, in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 403, submit to the Regional Wastewater Facilities
Manager brief reports indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent
which are limited by such Pretreatment Standards. These brief reports will be submitted at
least twice annually or as required by the Regional Manager. In addition, these reports shall
include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily
flow reported in Sections 6.2.1(e) and 6.2.3(c) of this ordinance. At the discretion of the
Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager and in consideration of such factors as local peak or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Regional Manager may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
(2) The Regional Manager may impose mass limitations on users, which become a part of the
permit, in cases where the imposition of such mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall indicate the mass of pollutants
in the effluent of the user regulated by Pretreatment Standards. Mass limitations are expressed
for a pollutant in terms of the permissible mass discharge in pounds or kilograms per day or in
pounds or kilograms per unit measure of product produced by the industrial process being
regulated. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge,
including the flow, nature, and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
Regional Manager, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
Pretreatment Standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the Industrial
Wastewater Discharge Permit or in the applicable Pretreatment Standard. All analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to Section
304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other
test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance
with techniques approved by the Administrator.
6.6 Confidential Information. User information and data obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit application, permits, and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to both
the City of Terrell Hills and the City of San Antonio, TDWR and EPA without restriction.
Regarding distribution of the above described information to other interested parties, including the
general public, unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City of Terrell Hills, and the City of San Antonio that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the
user, the information will be made available to the public.
When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the general public but
shall be made available, upon written request, to TDWR and EPA for uses related to this Ordinance,
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System permit
and/or the Pretreatment Program; provided, however, that such sensitive portions of a report shall be
available for use by the State or EPA in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 11--Real Property
37 01-29-14
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics in the indirect discharge
will not be recognized as confidential information.
SECTION 7. Enforcement.
7.1 Dangerous Discharges. The City Manager of the City of Terrell Hills, after consultation(s)
with Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager may order the suspension of water and/or wastewater
service(s) to any user in order to prevent or eliminate an indirect discharge which would, in the
professional engineering judgment of the Regional Manager, cause imminent, serious endangerment
to the health or safety of any person, significant damage to the environment, significant interference
with the POTW, or violations of the City of San Antonio NODES permit conditions.
Concurrent with ordering such a suspension, the City Manager of the City of Terrell Hills, in
conjunction with the Regional Manager shall issue a brief written letter report containing information
and investigative data upon which the City Manager relied in ordering the suspension of service(s).
A copy of this report will be expeditiously forwarded to the affected user(s) and to the Regional
Industrial Wastewater Review Board.
The City Manager shall order reinstatement of any discontinued water and/or wastewater
service(s) upon presentation to him by the user of written registered professional engineering proof
or other written proof acceptable to both the City Manager and Regional Manager that the dangerous
discharge has been eliminated and that recurrence is not possible.
Cost incurred by the City of Terrell Hills and/or the City of San Antonio or their agents in
detecting, investigating, monitoring, measuring and eliminating the dangerous discharge, along with
any disconnect and reconnect fees, shall be reimbursed to the appropriate City by the user(s)
responsible for the dangerous discharge. Any property damages to the POTW or its appurtenant
structures resulting from the dangerous discharge shall also be borne by the user(s) responsible for
the dangerous discharge.
Because of the urgent public need to immediately abate such dangerous discharges, the affected
user is not afforded an administrative review hearing before the regional Industrial Wastewater
Review Board prior to the City Manager ordering suspension of water and/or wastewater service(s).
Subsequent to an order to suspend service(s), the City Manager shall issue a notice of alleged
violation to the affected user in accordance with Section 7.2 below. This action will afford the
affected user an opportunity for administrative procedural review of an alleged violation of this
ordinance and/or the Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit.
7.2 Notice of Alleged Violations. Whenever, the City Manager of City of Terrell Hills, after
consultation with the Regional Wastewater Facilities Manager, believes that a user has violated or is
violating this ordinance and/or an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit, the City Manager or his
designated representative may serve (either personally or by registered or certified mail return receipt
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 11--Real Property
38 01-29-14
requested) upon such user a written notice stating the nature of the alleged violation. The recipient
of an alleged violation notice must respond in writing to the City Manager or his designated
representative within fifteen (15) working days of the mailing date or personal delivery date of such
notice.
7.3 Response by User to Notice of Alleged Violation. The user responding to receipt of an
alleged violation notice shall file written response in substantially one of the two following forms:
7.3.1 Should the user admit his or her responsibility for the alleged violation, the user must
submit a letter report to both the City Manager and the Regional Manager.
If the nature of the violation of either the Permit or this ordinance involves an indirect discharge
of industrial waste that is prohibited, or exceeds quantity, quality, or concentration limitations, the
letter report shall contain information regarding the time, date, location, cause, source, quantity,
quality and concentration of the discharge and the corrective measures actually taken, or to be taken,
by the user to prevent any similar recurrent discharges.
If the nature of the violation of either the Permit or this ordinance involves an administrative or
procedural noncompliance, the letter report shall contain information regarding corrective measures
and time schedules the user has adopted to assure expeditious compliance.
7.3.2 Should the user deny his or her responsibility for the alleged violation, the user must submit
a letter report to both the City Manager and the Regional Manager.
Regardless of the nature of the alleged violation (be it substantive regarding specific discharge(s)
of industrial waste, or administrative or procedural) the letter report may request an administrative
hearing before the Regional Industrial Wastewater Review Board to address the alleged violation.
In the alternative, the user may waive his or her right to an administrative hearing before the
Regional Industrial Wastewater Review Board and defend against any legal action taken by either the
City of Terrell Hills or the City of San Antonio in the appropriate court of jurisdiction.
Within ten (10) working days of the receipt by the Regional Manager of any written request for a
hearing, the Regional Manager or his designated representative shall respond in writing to the user
notifying the user of the date, time, and location of the hearing. All hearings shall take place within
thirty (30) working days of the receipt by the Regional Manager of the written request for such
hearing.
7.3.3 Should the recipient of an alleged violation notice fail to respond in writing to the Regional
Wastewater Facilities Manager within the initial fifteen (15) working days response period as
outlined above in 7.2, 7.3, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, the recipient user is deemed to have waived his or her right to
request an administrative hearing before the Regional Industrial Wastewater Review Board and may
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 11--Real Property
39 01-29-14
be sued or prosecuted by either the City of Terrell Hills or the City of San Antonio for the
consequences of the violation(s) cited in the notice of alleged violation at a legal proceeding in the
appropriate municipal, county, district, or federal court.
7.4 Regional Industrial Wastewater Review Board Hearing. The purpose and intent of the Review
Board hearing process is to afford a user requesting the hearing a non-litigative forum at which
alleged ordinance or Permit violations may be reviewed and/or resolved. Recommendations by the
Board to either the City Manager of City of Terrell Hills or the Regional Manager are not a required
prerequisite to, nor are they binding upon, either Official's actions or their recommendations to their
administrative superiors, legal counsel, or the City Manager regarding this ordinance or an Industrial
Wastewater Discharge Permit. The Regional Industrial Wastewater Review Board may issue
notices requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and experts familiar with alleged
violations. The Board may also call for the production of evidence relevant to the alleged violation.
At the hearing, a majority of the Regional Industrial Wastewater Review Board shall receive
evidence and testimony from appropriate public officials and the user in both written and oral form.
At the conclusion of the hearing the Board members present shall prepare a written summary report
of the proceedings for submittal to the entire Board for their review. After the entire Board has
reviewed the summary report it will adopt by a minimum 2/3 vote of the Board members present on
a designated day of decision, a formal recommendation to be presented to the respective public
officials addressing topics such as: suggested enforcement or legal actions, if any; compliance
schedules; proposed amendments or modifications to either this ordinance or an Industrial
Wastewater Discharge Permit; discontinuance of water or wastewater services; changes in
administrative or enforcement staff procedures; suggested pretreatment facilities for a user or class of
user; etc.

by notice affixed to the front door of the premises, that if the delinquent account is not paid in

views expressed by interested parties. The Council shall render a final decision concerning the
reasonableness, propriety, or existence of any sanitary sewer charges assessed to the user requesting

6. After it has been determined by the Council that the hearing process has been exhausted or
waived by the user, and that the user is delinquent in payments owed for sanitary sewer service, and
where the premises receive metered water service from a water purveyor under contract with the City
to collect sewer charges, the Council shall direct that utility to discontinue water service to the
delinquent sewer user.
7. After it has been determined by the Council that the hearing process has been exhausted or
waived by the user, and that the user is delinquent in payments owed for sanitary sewer service, and
where the premises do not receive metered water service, the Council shall direct the Secretary-
Manager to physically disconnect the delinquent user's sewer service lateral from the main.
8. Once sanitary sewer service has been disconnected as hereinabove provided, it shall not be
reinstated until all charges shown on the sewer bill, plus the reasonable cost of disconnecting the
sewer lateral and the reasonable cost of reconnecting the sewer lateral are paid in full. In addition,
the City shall require the user to make a reasonable security deposit with the City or water purveyor
to assure future timely payment of sanitary sewer charges. This security deposit shall be collected,
deposited and refunded in accordance with State law governing such deposits.
9. When any user liable for sewer charges shall leave the premises to which such charge is
applicable, the user shall not be furnished sewer service at the premises occupied by the user within

The construction, placement, or maintenance of a fence, wall, vegetation, ground sign, or any
other object that partially or totally obstructs the vision of the operator of a motor vehicle upon
exiting a driveway onto a street or at the intersection of two or more streets, creates a hazardous

SECTION III. Notice To Abate And Service Of Notice
Upon receiving a complaint of a hazardous visual obstruction as described, the Chief of Police,
or his designee, shall examine the named lot or intersection and determine whether or not such a
hazard exists.
If the Chief of Police or the designee finds that a fence, wall, vegetation, ground sign, or other
object is, in fact, a hazardous visual obstruction, notice to abate the hazard shall be given to the
owner of such lot or parcel of real estate. Abatement shall occur no later than 30 days after notice is
received; however, if the hazard is an imminent threat to public safety, the Chief of Police may order
its immediate removal. Written notification to abate may be made by means of a Police Officer
delivering the notice to said owner in person or by attaching the notice to the front door or by mailing
the notice to same by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested. If the correct address of the owner
of the lot or parcel of real estate cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort, notice may be served

to remove the hazard and to charge the cost and expense of such work to the property owner. Such

statement of the cost thereof shall be sent to the owner of said lot or parcel of real estate for payment
within ten days of the mailing of such statement.

A Person is subject to police power regulation of the City to manage its Public Right-of-way in connection
with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of Facilities in the Public Right-ofway,
pursuant to the City's rights as a custodian of public property, based upon the City's historic rights
under state and federal laws. Such regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) At the City's request, a Person shall furnish the City accurate and complete information
relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of
Facilities performed by the Person in the Public Right-of-Way.
(2) A Person may be required to place certain Facilities within the Public Right-of-Way

Person that, in any specific instance, this requirement is not reasonable or feasible nor is it equally
applicable to other similar users of the Public Right-of-Way.
(3) A Person shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the Public Right-of-
Way in accordance with all applicable City requirements, including the obligation to use trenchless
technology whenever commercially economical and practical and consistent with obligations on
other similar users of the Public Right-of-Way. The City shall waive the requirement of trenchless
technology if it determines that the field conditions warrant the waiver, based upon information
provided to the City by the Person. All excavations and other construction in the Public Right-of-
Way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. A
Person shall follow all construction directions given by the City in order to minimize any such
interference.
(4) A Person must obtain a permit, as required by applicable City codes, prior to any excavation,
construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the Person's
Facilities. Once a permit is issued, the Person shall give to the City a minimum of forty-eight (48)
hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of
the above listed activities on its Network in, on, or under the Public Right-of-Way. The failure of
the Person to request and obtain a permit from the City prior to performing any of the above listed
activities in, on, or over any Public Right-of-Way, except in an emergency as provided for in
Subsection ( I I ) below, will subject the Person to a stop-work order from the City and enforcement
action pursuant to the City's Code of Ordinances. If the Person fails to act upon any permit within
90 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the Person will be required to
obtain another permit.
(5) When a Person completes construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or
other work, the Person shall promptly restore the Right-of-Way in accordance with applicable City
requirements. A Person shall replace and properly relay and repair the surface, base, irrigation

reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the Person's Facilities within thirty
(30) calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing standards of the City in
effect at the time of the work.
(6) Upon failure of a Person to perform any such repair or replacement work, and five (5) days
after written notice has been given by the City to the Person, at the sole cost and expense of the
Person, the City may repair such portion of the Public Right-of-Way as may have been disturbed by
the Person, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the City, the Person shall pay
the City for the costs so incurred within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the City invoice.

proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction at least fifteen (15) days before beginning
construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the Public
Right-of-way. A Person may not begin construction until the location of new Facilities and
proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings
have been approved in writing by the City, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the Facilities and
routing.

additional users, may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law.
(C) If the City authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public
street, alley, or Public Right-of-Way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights
of the previously authorized user of the Public Right-of-Way. If the City closes or abandons a
Public Right-of-Way that contains a portion of a Person's Facilities, the City shall close or
abandon such Public Right-of-Way subject to the rights of the Person.

for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its Facilities. All tree trimming shall be
performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the City. Should the Person, its contractor
or agent fail to remove such trimmings within twenty-four (24) hours, the City may, at the sole cost
and expense of the Person, remove the trimmings or have them removed, and upon receipt of a
bill from the City, the Person shall promptly pay the City for all costs incurred within thirty (30)

insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Texas acceptable to the City throughout
the term of a Municipal Consent conveyed under this Chapter. A Person shall furnish the City with
proof of insurance at the time of the request for building permits. The City reserves the right to
review the insurance requirements and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the
City Manager determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the
industry or the Person require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the City will
accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the State of Texas or letters written by the Person in
those instances where the State does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as
required herein. However, for the City to accept such letters the Person must demonstrate by
written information that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably
determined by the City, based on financial information requested by and furnished to the City. The

provisions are established by a law or regulation binding the City, the Person, or the underwriter. If
the City requests a deletion, revision or modification, a Person shall use reasonable efforts to
accomplish the change, which change shall be made at the person’s sole cost and expense.

A. In the A or A-1 Residential Districts, the intent is to create development standards that limit
height and bulk to:
1. Assure that buildings are compatible in mass and scale with those of buildings seen
traditionally in residential neighborhoods of Terrell Hills;
2. Maintain the traditional scale of buildings as seen along the street;
3. Minimize visual impacts of new construction of larger buildings and additions to
existing structures on adjacent existing buildings and properties;
4. Promote access to light and air between adjacent properties;
5. Reduce the visual impacts of impervious surfaces in the front yard setback area;
6. Maintain the perception of the natural slope, promote stepping of building forms to
follow site contours in areas with substantial topographic relief, and reduce the visual
impact of cut and fill on adjacent properties; and
7. Preserve and enhance the existing mature tree canopy in front yards.
SECTION IV. SCOPE OF REGULATIONS
This ordinance shall apply to all private property located in the Residential A Zoning
District within the jurisdiction of the City of Terrell Hills.

(2) Bulk Plane. In order to minimize the impact of larger structures, the following standards shall
apply:
(i) For all lots, a bulk plane shall begin at a point located at the maximum wall
plate height at the minimum side yard setback. The bulk plane shall continue upward one foot for
every foot it steps in toward the center of the site as shown in Figure G. This shall continue until it
reaches the maximum allowed height for the site or it intersects the bulk plane as taken from the
opposite side of the lot. The maximum permitted wall plate height shall rise one foot for every one
foot that the wall steps toward the center of the site from the minimum side yard setback.
(ii) All buildings must fit within the bulk plane as shown in figure H with the
exception of the following architectural elements:
(a) The end of a gable roof may protrude through the bulk plane by a
maximum of 8 feet as shown in Figure J.
(b) Dormers meeting the criteria set forth in Section (d)(3) are
excepted from the bulk plane as shown in Figure K.
(iii) For lots 115 feet or less in width, an exception shall be made to raise the
maximum permitted wall plate height at the minimum side setback to 20 feet for the first 40 feet to
the rear of the front setback on one but not both sides of the lot as shown in Figure I. The maximum
wall plate height at the minimum side setback will be 10 feet on all other portions of the lot. The side
of the lot where this exception will apply shall be at the property owner’s discretion.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 14--Zoning
10 ZONING-3.DOC.WPD 04-08-14
(iv) A rear bulk plane shall apply in order to minimize the impact of looming
structures on properties to the rear. The rear bulk plane shall begin at a wall plate height of 10 feet at
the minimum rear yard setback and shall continue upward one foot for every foot it steps inward
towards the front of the site. This shall continue until it reaches the maximum allowed height for the
site as shown in Figure H and Figure I.

30% of width of the front wall plane.
(5) Vehicle Use Area. Paving of the front yard for vehicle access and parking shall be limited to
30% of the total square footage of the front yard as calculated by the total parcel width multiplied by
the distance between the front property line and the required minimum setback line as shown in
Figure M. In addition,
(i) If a circular drive or paved parking area, which is located in the front
setback, exceeds 30% of the area of the front yard setback, it shall be paved with a high grade asphalt
and include a decorative edger or shall be paved with a decorative paving material such as unit stone,
or other modular pavers, scored and dyed concrete, or brick.
(ii) The amount of surface paving may increase to 40% if a 10-foot
landscaped buffer containing a buffer of not less than 36-inches in height is located within, adjacent

constructed based on a radius which shall not exceed 6 feet or a flair which may not extend further
than 3 feet from each side of the drive at the curb and must intersect the drive within 6 feet of the
curb.
(vi) For all lots, any portion of a driveway or apron that extends across a
right-of-way easement shall lie within the side property lines of the lot as though the property lines
extended to the curb.
(vii) For non-corner lots less than 80 feet in width, one curb cut is allowed
along the primary street. Where an alley exists, an additional curb cut may be used to access the alley
for a total of two curb cuts.

(7) Front Yard Shade Tree. For new construction, for new additions altering the existing front
wall plane, and for new site/paving improvements within the front yard setback, shade trees shall be
provided in the required front yard setback area. The number of required shade trees is dependent
upon the width of the parcel. Parcels less than 80 feet in width shall be required to install one new
shade tree prior to issuing building occupancy permit. Parcels measuring 80 feet or more shall be
required to install two new shade trees prior to issuing building occupancy permit. The tree shall
have a minimum size of 2.5-inch caliper at time of planting. A list of recommended tree species is
available in the City planning office. Credit shall be provided for:
(i) Existing shade trees in the required front setback, which are listed on the
recommended species list and are at least 4-inch caliper;
(ii) Existing evergreen trees in the required front setback that are at least six
feet tall; and
(iii) Existing trees planted within the public right-of-way.
(8) Fences and Walls. In order to assure that new fences and walls maintain views from the

(9) Cut and Fill. In order to minimize the impact of cut and fill on sloped sites of 10% or more,
the following regulations shall apply:
(i) Develop a site plan that seeks to limit the amount of cut and fill required
for site improvements.
(ii) The maximum amount of unfinished exposed foundation shall not
exceed four feet at any point, from natural or finished grade, whichever is the most restrictive.
(iii) It is the intent of the City for new development to minimize the amount
of cut and fill required for installation of a new or improved driveway. To the extent feasible, a new
driveway shall follow existing topographic contours. Any resulting road cuts 18” or greater must
integrate a combination of a finished retaining wall and plant material.
(iv) Where a site retaining wall is necessary, it shall blend with the natural
features of the landscape and convey a scale and texture similar to traditional materials found within
the neighborhood and complimenting the primary structure. Limit the height of a retaining wall to
less than four feet. Where greater heights in a retaining wall must occur, use a series of terraced or
stepped walls. The width of a retaining terrace shall not be less than three feet. The City may vary the
retaining wall height and width requirements depending on site conditions (see paragraph (d)(8) (i)
above).

following architectural elements: perforations that impact the solid-to-void ratio such as doors or
windows and a 2 foot offset for every 40 feet of façade.
SECTION VII. ORDINANCE REVIEW
The City shall conduct a review of the effects of the ordinance 18 months after their adoption.
Listed below are exceptions adopted by the City prior to August 13, 2007 that are not in conflict
with the new provisions regulating Residential Zone District A. If any of the following
exceptions are found to be inconsistent with the ordinance, the specific provision shall overrule a
general provision.
a. EXCEPTION 1: On the following Auburn Place area lots, zero lot line dwellings
will be permitted so long as such dwellings are located at least twenty-five feet (25') from the
front property line and ten feet (10') from either the side street property line or the opposite
property line, whichever is applicable, and provided that only one such dwelling shall be
erected on a boundary line separating two lots, to wit:
Lots 1A through 14A (or any portions thereof), Block 20,CB5742, bounded on the
north by a thoroughfare known as State Spur 368 ("Austin Highway"), as such lots
presently exist or as they may be subsequently replatted.
All other setback requirements provided for in this Ordinance which are not inconsistent with
this Exception shall be applicable to such lots; provided further, private garages, whether
attached or detached from the main dwelling may be located as close as three feet (3') from
the rear property line, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Ordinance to the
contrary.
b. EXCEPTION 2: On the following Auburn Place area lots, dwellings may be located
as near as thirty-five feet (35') to the front property line (i.e., the minimum front building
setback line for dwellings erected on such lots shall be thirty-five feet (35')) to wit:
Lots 1A through 3A, Block 21, CB5742, as such lots exist or as they may be
subsequently replatted.
All other setback requirements provided for in this Ordinance which are not inconsistent with
this Exception shall be applicable to such lots.
City of Terrell Hills Code Chapter 14--Zoning
19 ZONING-3.DOC.WPD 04-08-14
c. EXCEPTION 3: On the two (2) lots resulting from a replatting of Lot 16H, CB5526,
the dwellings hereafter erected on such replatted Lots shall face each other. The front lot line
for dwelling setback purposes shall be deemed to be the common boundary of such replatted
lots.
d. EXCEPTION 4: On the four (4) lots resulting from replatting lots 19, 20, and 21,
Block 22, County Block 5742, hereafter referred to as the “Waterford Villas lots”, zero lot
line dwellings will be permitted so long as such dwellings are located at least twenty (20')
from the front property line and five feet (5') from either the side street property line or the
opposite property line, whichever is applicable, and provided that only one such dwelling
shall be erected on a boundary line separating two lots.
