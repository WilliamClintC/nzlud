1.14.010 Findings.

A. RCW 42.56.070(1) requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of various public records.

B. RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reason why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

C. The city is comprised of numerous departments, their divisions and subdivisions, many if not all of which maintain separate databases and/or systems for the indexing of records and information.

D. Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations, and in multiple computer systems and databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records.

E. The city produces or receives an uncountable number of records each day and maintains an uncountable number of records in numerous city files.

F. The development and maintenance of a central index would be extremely costly and would provide little benefit to the public compared to the expense in maintaining the index.

G. The city’s revenues and operations do not allow for the addition, revision, or reassignment of duties of existing personnel, or additional staff, so that an index may be developed and maintained.

H. Pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW, the city will disclose all public records, including any indexes that are maintained by the city to the extent such records or indexes are not exempt from disclosure pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable laws. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.020 Public records index – Order – Maintenance not required.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the city council orders the following:

A. The city is not required to maintain a current index of public records due to findings of the city council that the requirement to do so is unduly burdensome and would interfere with city operations and such a list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain; and

B. Pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW, the city shall disclose all public records and any indexes of public records maintained by the city to the extent such records are not exempt from disclosure pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable laws. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.030 Public records disclosure – Purpose.

A. The purpose of the Public Records Act is to provide the public with full access to information concerning the conduct of government, mindful of individuals’ privacy rights and the desirability of efficient administration of government. The Public Records Act provides a statutory framework by which to administer access to public records. The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedure for obtaining public records from the city as required by Chapter 42.56 RCW, as currently enacted or hereafter amended.

B. The information contained in this document is designed to aid both those requesting public records and those responding to records requests. The document should assist in guiding expectations of requesters and providing notice of a mechanism by which to appeal a records decision, if necessary. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.040 Reference.

A. Chapter 42.56 RCW, Public Records Act.

B. Chapter 44-14 WAC, Public Records Act – Model Rules. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.050 Public records officer – Responsibility/authority.

A. The city clerk is the designated public records officer. The city’s public records officer will oversee compliance with the Public Records Act and these procedures. The city’s public records officer may delegate the responsibilities of processing requests to other staff. Departments may also designate records coordinators within specific departments to facilitate access to public records within that department, so long as each coordinator is identified to the public records officer.

B. City staff will provide assistance to requesters, reasonably ensure that public records are protected from damage or disorganization and prevent fulfilling public records requests from causing excessive interference with essential functions of the city. Assigned city staff will be responsible and held accountable to meet the city’s responsibilities of this policy. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary actions. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.060  Definitions – Adoption by reference.

The definitions set forth in Chapter 42.56 RCW, as presently adopted and as may be subsequently amended, are hereby adopted by reference, together with all amendments and additions provided in this chapter. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.070 Municipal services and central office.

The city provides a full range of traditional municipal services through various departments. City Hall, the central office, is located at 350 N Market Blvd, Room 101, Chehalis, WA 98532, and several field offices exist throughout the city. A city organizational chart is included under CMC 1.14.230. Any person wishing to request access to public records from a single department may make the request to that individual department’s records coordinator or may make a request to the public records officer. Any person seeking assistance in making a request which includes more than one department should contact the public records officer:

City Clerk – Public Records Officer 

City of Chehalis

350 N Market Blvd., Room 101

Chehalis, WA 98532

Phone: 360-345-1042

Fax: 360-748-0651

cfoley@ci.chehalis.wa.us

[Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.080 Availability of public records.

A. Many records are available on the city’s website at www.ci.chehalis.wa.us. Requesters are encouraged to view the documents available on the website prior to submitting a records request.

B. Public records are generally available for inspection and copying during normal business hours of Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., excluding legal holidays. Records must be inspected at a city office. Requesters are prohibited from removing records from city offices.

C. The city will maintain its records in a reasonably organized manner, and take reasonable actions to protect records from damage and disorganization. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.090 Making request for public records.

A. While requesters are not required to specifically name the Public Records Act, they must give reasonable notice that the request is being made pursuant to the Act.

B. Requesters must request identifiable records or classes of records that the city can reasonably locate even though they are not required to specifically state the exact record sought. For example, using inexact phrases such as “relating to” a topic (such as “all records relating to the property tax increase”) will need clarification from the requester to determine what records fairly and directly address the topic.

C. Any person wishing to inspect or request public records of the city shall make the request in writing on the city’s request form. A form is available for use by requesters at the office of the public records officer and online at http://ci.chehalis.wa.us/forms/cityclerk. Requests may be made in person, by mail, by fax, or by email to the designated records officer set forth in CMC 1.14.070. Email requests must include the following information:

1. Name of requester;

2. Date of request;

3. Phone, mailing address, and email address of requester;

4. Adequate identification of the public records being requested (e.g., title/dates, if known);

5. Location (department) of the requested records, if known;

6. Whether the requester intends to inspect the records or obtain copies of the records; and

7. Method by which the city should contact requester.

D. City staff will request that a public records request form be completed. The public records request form is available at http://ci.chehalis.wa.us/forms/cityclerk. However, if the request is by telephone or the requester is in need of assistance, responding staff will confirm receipt of the information and the substance of the request in writing by entering the request information into the city’s tracking system on the requester’s behalf.

E. If the record(s) requested is not easily identified, may be kept by multiple departments, or the requester is unsure of where to file the request, the requester should direct the request to the city clerk’s office.

F. Affected staff will be advised by records coordinators to retain possession of records covered by public records requests, including any records that may be scheduled for destruction. City staff may not destroy or otherwise delete covered records until the request is fulfilled.

G. A requester is not typically required to state the purpose of the request. However, in instances where additional information is required by law or in an effort to clarify or prioritize a request and provide responsive records, the public records officer or designee may inquire about the nature or scope of the request.

H. The city may deny a bot request that is one of multiple requests from the requester to the city within a 24-hour period, if the city establishes that responding to the multiple requests would cause excessive interference with other essential functions of the city. A “bot request” is a request for public records that the city believes was automatically generated by a computer program or script. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.100 Processing public records requests.

The public records officer or designee will process requests promptly in the order allowing the most requests to be processed in the most efficient manner.

A. Within five business days of receipt of the request (day one is the first working day after the request is received), the public records officer or designee will do one or more of the following:

1. Provide the records;

2. Provide the records for inspection and copying;

3. Provide an internet address/link to the city website where the records can be accessed. Requesters who cannot access the internet must be provided copies of the record or allowed to view the record on a city computer;

4. Acknowledge receipt of the request and provide a reasonable estimate of time when the records will be available;

5. Acknowledge receipt of the request and ask for clarification if the request is unclear, and provide, to the greatest extent possible, a reasonable estimate of time to respond to the request if it is not clarified; or

6. Deny the request. The city will provide a written statement of the specific reason for a denial of public records.

If the city does not respond in writing within five business days of receipt of the request for disclosure, the requester should consider contacting the public records officer to determine the reason for the failure to respond.

B. In the event that the requested records contain information that may affect rights of others and/or may be exempt from disclosure, the public records officer may, prior to providing the records, give notice to those persons. Such notice should be given to make it possible for those receiving the notice to seek an order from a court to prevent or limit the disclosure. The notice to the affected persons will typically include a copy of the request.

C. Some records are exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part. If the city believes that a record or portion of a record is exempt from disclosure and should be withheld, the public records officer or designee will state the specific exemption and provide a brief explanation of why the record or a portion of the record is being withheld. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.110 Inspection of public records.

A. The city will provide space for persons to inspect public records. No member of the public may remove a document from the viewing area or disassemble or alter any document. The requester shall indicate which documents he or she would like copied.

B. Requesters wishing to inspect electronic records will first be directed to an internet address where the records can be accessed, if available. Records may be provided electronically or on a storage device. If the requester cannot access records in these ways, the city will provide hard copies or allow the requester to view copies on a city computer.

C. The requester must make arrangements to claim or review the assembled records within 30 days of notification that the records are available for inspection or copying.

D. If the requester fails to claim or review the records within the 30-day period or make other arrangements, the city may close the request and refile the assembled records. In the event the requester submits a new request for the same or almost identical records, the process will begin anew. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.120 Providing copies of public records.

After inspection is complete, the public records officer or designee shall make the requested copies or arrange for copying. The requester shall pay any applicable deposit prior to copies being made. Full payment for copies must be received prior to delivery of the requested copies. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.130 Providing records in installments.

A. When the request is for a large number of records or when a portion of responsive records is more readily available than others, the public records officer or designee may provide access for inspection and copying in installments if he or she reasonably determines that it would be practical to provide the records in that way.

B. If, within 30 days, the requester fails to inspect the available installments, the public records officer may discontinue his/her search for the remaining records and close the request. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.140 Completion of response to inspect public records.

When the search for requested records is complete and all requested records are provided for inspection, the public records officer or designee will indicate that the city has completed a reasonable search for the requested records and made any located, nonexempt records available for inspection. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.150 Closing withdrawn or abandoned requests.

When the requester either withdraws the request or fails to fulfill his or her obligation to timely inspect the records or fails to pay the required amount due for requested copies, the public records officer will close the request and indicate to the requester that the city has closed the request. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.160 Later-discovered documents.

If, after the city has informed the requester that it has provided responsive records, the city becomes aware of additional responsive documents existing at the time of the request, it will promptly inform the requester of the additional documents and provide them as soon as possible. However, a public records request is not continuing in nature. If a requester desires additional records created or obtained by the city after the date of the original request, the requester must submit a new request. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.170 Completion of request.

The city’s response to a request shall be deemed completed upon the requester’s inspection of the records or upon notification that copies of all the requested records are available for payment and delivery or pick up, or that no responsive records exist. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.180 No duty to create new records.

The city is not obligated to create new records to satisfy a records request; however, the city may, at its discretion, create such new records to fulfill the request where the city deems that method of response more expedient. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.190 Process of public records request – Electronic records.

A. The process for requesting electronic records is the same as for requesting public records in paper copy.

B. When a requester seeks records in an electronic format, the public records officer will provide the nonexempt records or portions of such records that are reasonably locatable in an electronic format that is used by the city and is generally commercially available, or in a format that is reasonably translatable from the format in which the city keeps the record.

C. Electronic mail (email) is an informational transfer system which uses computers for sending and receiving messages. Email messages are public records when they are prepared, owned, used, or retained by the city and relate to the conduct of government or performance of any governmental or proprietary function. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.200 Exemptions.

A. The Public Records Act provides that a number of types of documents are exempt from public inspection and copying. In addition, documents are exempt from disclosure if any “other statute” exempts or prohibits disclosure. Requesters should take note that there are many exemptions contained outside of the Public Records Act that may restrict the availability for inspection or release of some documents. Many such exemptions are listed under CMC 1.14.230. This list is for informational purposes only and failure to list an exemption shall not affect the efficacy of any exemption.

B. The city is prohibited by statute from disclosing lists of individuals for commercial purposes. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.210 Costs of providing copies of public records.

A. The city finds that calculating the actual costs it charges for providing records would be unduly burdensome and therefore adopts the following charges for copying public records:

1. Copying Records. There will be no charge for the first 100 pages for photocopies of public records, or printed copies of electronic public records. Fifteen cents per page will be charged if the request exceeds 100 pages (e.g., 101 pages will cost $15.15).

2. Scanning Records. There will be no charge for the first 100 pages for public records scanned into an electronic format. Ten cents per page will be charged if the requests exceed 100 pages (e.g., 101 pages will cost $10.10).

3. Waived Fees. The following charges shall be waived:

a. For victims or persons involved in an incident pertaining to police records; and

b. The uploading and/or transmission of scanned records.

4. Storage Media, Supplies, Postage. The city may charge for the actual costs of any digital storage media or device, any container or envelope, and/or any postage or delivery charges.

5. Outside Copying Services. If, at the city’s discretion, materials need to be copied by an outside source, the requester will be charged the actual amount invoiced to the city by the copying vendor.

6. Customized Access. The city may include a customized service charge if a request requires the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations or provide customized electronic access services when such services are not used by the city for other city purposes. Said charge may reimburse the city up to the actual cost of providing the services in this section. The city may not assess said charge unless a requester has been notified that said charge is to be applied to the request, including an explanation of why said charge applies, a description of the specific expertise, a reasonable estimate cost of the charge, and provide the requester the opportunity to amend his or her request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of a customized service charge.

B. The charges in this section may be combined to the extent that more than one type of charge applies to copies produced in response to a particular request.

C. A requester may ask the city to provide, and if requested the city shall provide, a summary of the applicable charges before any copies are made. The requester may revise the request to reduce the number of copies to be made and reduce the applicable charges.

D. In the event a request is estimated to exceed $50.00, the city may require a deposit in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of providing copies for a request, including a customized service charge. If the city makes a request available on a partial or installment basis, the city may charge for each part of the request as it is provided. If an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.

E. No fee shall be charged for the inspection of public records, locating public documents and making them available for copying, or for access to or downloading of records that are available on the city’s website, unless the requester specifically requests that the city provide copies of such records through other means.

F. Payments may be made by cash, check, or money order payable to the city of Chehalis. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]


1.14.220 Review of denials of public records.

A. Any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing to the public records officer for a review of that decision. The petition must include a copy of or shall reasonably identify the written statement by the public records officer or designee denying the request.

B. The public records officer or designee will immediately consider the petition and either affirm or reverse the denial within two business days following the public records officer’s receipt of the petition, or within such time as the city and the requester mutually agree. [Ord. 989B, 2018.]

2.88.030    Alternative sanctions as a privilege.

2.88.040    Policies and procedures.

2.88.050    Referrals to other agencies for EHM services.


2.88.010 Findings.

The city council of the city of Chehalis has considered the risks and benefits associated with utilizing a combination of supervised and unsupervised alternatives to incarceration and have determined that the benefits of such programs outweigh the risk that some misdemeanants will commit offenses that might have been prevented if they were incarcerated. In making this decision, the city council finds that the majority of misdemeanants sentenced by the Chehalis municipal court have committed nonviolent offenses and serve jail sentences of less than a week; that the misdemeanants routinely schedule a date to report to jail that is several weeks after the date of sentencing; and that the primary purpose of imposing jail sentences is to punish prior misconduct and to discourage future misconduct (recidivism) and not to prevent the commission of new offenses by removing the misdemeanant from society. The city council also recognizes that an alternative sanctions program presents an inherent risk of shortcomings or errors in the selection and monitoring of misdemeanants in the alternative sanctions program. Nevertheless, the city council concludes that an alternative sanctions program will help to reduce the costs incurred for incarceration of misdemeanants sentenced by the Chehalis municipal court while still serving the purpose of punishment and reducing recidivism. [Ord. 873B § 1, 2011.]


2.88.020 Definitions.

The following words, terms, and phrases shall have the following meanings:

A. “Sentence monitor” shall mean the administrative staff in the municipal court that monitors sentences imposed by the judge of the municipal court including EHM compliance.

B. “Alternative sanctions” shall mean incarceration other than confinement in the jail such as electronic home monitoring.

C. “Defendant” shall mean a person whose case has been adjudicated through the municipal court.

D. “Electronic home monitoring (EHM)” shall mean the monitoring of a defendant in a private residence, or another qualifying residence, subject to an acceptable system of electronic surveillance. [Ord. 873B § 2, 2011.]


2.88.030 Alternative sanctions as a privilege.

Participation in the alternative sanctions program is discretionary and the defendant shall have no right to participate in such a program rather than serving the entire jail sentence imposed by the court. There shall be no guarantee to any defendant that he or she will be permitted to participate in any program even after a date for participation is established. [Ord. 873B § 3, 2011.]


2.88.040 Policies and procedures.

The municipal court administrator shall establish policies and procedures for the sentence monitoring judicial assistant who currently administers the EHM program in the municipal court. These policies and procedures will include the following:

A. Establish fees for participation based on the cost of administering the program.

B. Provide guidelines establishing the qualifications of a defendant to participate in the EHM program.

C. Provide guidelines for noncompliance with the EHM program.

D. Establish the number of defendants that may participate in the EHM program. [Ord. 873B § 4, 2011.]


2.88.050 Referrals to other agencies for EHM services.

The court recognizes that, in order to adequately monitor defendants enrolled in its EHM program, it must limit the number of defendants that can be monitored at one time. Therefore, there may be times when a defendant is referred to an outside agency for EHM services. The court may maintain a list of agencies, approved by the municipal court judge, that provide EHM services. [Ord. 873B § 5, 2011.]

1. A book-entry system of recording the ownership of the bond or obligation on the books of the registrar, whether or not a physical instrument is issued; or

The following terms shall have the following meanings, except where the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is intended and except where any section of this chapter concerning a particular business contains a specific provision to the contrary. Terms not defined herein shall have their accepted and usual meaning.

“BLS” is the Business Licensing Service within the Washington State Department of Revenue providing business licensing services to the city.

“Business” includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the person engaging therein or to another person or class, directly or indirectly, including any activity conducted for the sale of goods or providing of services for a profit.

“DRC” means the city development review committee.

“Engage in business” means to commence, conduct, or continue in business, or to exercise corporate or franchise powers as well as to liquidate a business when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting such business. For out-of-city businesses, “engage in business” shall refer to the point of sale, not the point of delivery.

“License” shall include and be used interchangeably with the term “permit” and shall mean the official approval or authorization of the city to engage in business or to carry on or conduct a special event within the corporate limits of the city for which a license or permit is required pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

“Person” shall include and be used interchangeably with the terms “company,” “corporation,” “individual,” “owner,” “partnership,” “proprietorship,” and “sole proprietorship” and shall mean any individual, receiver, administrator, executor, assignee, trustee in bankruptcy, trust, estate, firm, joint venture, club, business trust, association, society, or group of individuals acting as a unit, whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal, religious, profit, nonprofit, or otherwise.

“Standard business” means to engage in a business in the city for a continuous period of 30 days or more.

“Temporary business” means to engage in business for a period of less than 30 days or to operate a business out of a vehicle, truck, trailer, other mobile unit, or from a building, structure, or leasehold improvement which is not taxed as a part of the real property on which the business is located. [Ord. 992B, 2018.]


5.04.020 License required.

The threshold does not apply to regulatory license requirements or activities that require a specialized permit.

C. This section sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the city and establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimis business activities in the city without having to pay a business license fee. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business.” If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the city shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and applicable law.

D. Without being all inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker, or another acting on its behalf, constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:

11. Delivering goods in vehicles owned, rented, leased, used, or maintained by the person or another acting on his/her behalf.

E. The city expressly intends that engaging in business include any activity sufficient to establish nexus for purposes of applying the license fee under the law and the constitutions of the United States and the state of Washington. Nexus is presumed to continue as long as the taxpayer benefits from the activity that constituted the original nexus-generating contact or subsequent contacts. [Ord. 992B, 2018.]

B. This chapter shall not be interpreted as limiting the number of licenses that may be issued or as limiting the number of businesses of any particular kind that may be operated within the corporate limits of the city.

C. Any business in the city, whether or not properly licensed, may be inspected by city officers and employees authorized to enforce provisions of ordinances relating to such business or to the premises upon or within which such business is conducted.

Immediately upon arriving at a place of business for the purpose of making an inspection, the city officer or employee making the inspection shall identify himself or herself and shall state that the purpose of the visit is to make an inspection. No person having control of any business premises shall refuse to permit a city officer or employee to enter for the purpose of making an inspection. If entry is refused, the city officer or employee shall leave and pursue appropriate legal action relating to the specific circumstance. Refusal by any applicant or licensee to allow inspection of any business premises shall be grounds to deny any related business license application and to revoke any previously issued business license.

D. No city ordinance relating to business licenses shall be interpreted as granting or attempting to grant to any city officer or employee any discretionary authority to issue a license or to refuse to issue a license. The license shall be issued to each applicant complying with all applicable Washington State laws and city ordinances and a license shall be refused for any applicant failing to comply with all such laws and ordinances.

E. No person shall be issued a city business license if the laws and regulations of the state of Washington or the United States government require such person to have a license or permit under state or federal law or regulation and such person does not possess such state or federal license or permit.

[Ord. 992B, 2018.]


5.04.080 Exemptions.

5.04.130 Parades, athletic events, and other special events.

A. Definitions.

“Special events” include any activity which is to be conducted on public property or on a public right-of-way; any event held on private property which would have a direct significant impact on traffic congestion; or traffic flow to and from the event over public streets or right-of-way; or which would significantly impact public streets or right-of-way near the event; or which would significantly impact the need for city-provided emergency services, such as police, fire, or medical aid. It is presumed that any event on private property which involves an open invitation to the public to attend or events where the attendance is by private invitation of 100 or more people are each presumed to be an event that will have a direct significant impact on the public streets, right-of-way or emergency services. Special events might include but are not limited to: fun runs/walks, athletic competitions, auctions, bike-a-thons, public fundraisers, parades, carnivals, festivals, shows or exhibitions, film/movie events, circuses, block parties, and fairs.

“Special events protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments” include any event involving political or religious activity intended primarily for the communication or expression of ideas.

“Use” shall mean to construct, erect, or maintain in, on, over, or under any street, right-of-way, park, or other public place any building, structure, sign, equipment, or scaffolding, to deface any public right-of-way by painting, spraying, or writing on the surface thereof, or to otherwise occupy in such a manner as to obstruct the normal public use of any public street, right-of-way, park, or other public place within the city, including a use related to special events.

B. Permit Required. A special event permit or authorization from the city is required for any event in a park, public place, or on private property where it will significantly impact public sidewalks, roadways, or services. A safety plan is required to be submitted with a special event permit. Such special event permit and safety plan shall be in addition to any street or park use, or other regular permits as may be required by ordinance.

Event permit applications for use of public parks must be made to and approved by the city’s recreation department; however, any impact to the right-of-way occasioned by the use of the parks may also require a right-of-way permit.

Primary traffic routes through the city such as Market Boulevard, Chehalis Avenue, State Street, Main Street, and National Avenue, as well as primary traffic routes around the core downtown business area, will only be considered for closure when the event is organized by a recognized community organization and the event serves a broader community purpose. For example, the summer festival organized by local nonprofit organizations and the holiday parade held by the Chamber of Commerce.

When such an event will be an exercise of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the application shall be processed promptly, without charging a fee for political or religious activities or imposing terms or conditions that infringe upon constitutional freedoms, and in a manner that respects the liberty of applicants and the public.

A special event permit may not be required for the following:

1. Parades, athletic events, or other special events that are fully sponsored or conducted in full by the city (a review process through the DRC may still be applicable in these instances).

3. Groups required by law to be so assembled.

4. Gatherings of 30 or fewer people in a city park, unless merchandise or services are offered for sale or trade.

Waiver of Application Deadline. Upon a showing of good cause or at the discretion of the DRC or city, the city shall consider an application that is filed after the filing deadline if there is sufficient time to process and investigate the application and obtain police and other city services for the event. Good cause can be demonstrated by the applicant showing that the circumstance that gave rise to the permit application did not reasonably allow the participants to file within the time prescribed, and the event is for the purpose of exercising rights under the First and/or Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.

C. Grounds for Denial of Application. The city may deny an application for a special event permit if:

1. The applicant provides false or misleading information.

2. The applicant fails to complete the application or to supply other required information of documents or the applicant declares or shows an unwillingness or inability to comply with the reasonable terms or conditions contained in the proposed permit.

3. The proposed event would conflict with another proximate event, interfere with construction or maintenance work in the immediate vicinity, or unreasonably infringe upon the rights of abutting property.

4. The proposed event would unreasonably disrupt the orderly or safe circulation of traffic and would present an unreasonable risk of injury or damage to the public.

5. There are not sufficient safety personnel or other necessary city staff to accommodate the event.

In the event subsection (C)(3) or (4) of this section applies, the city shall offer the applicant the opportunity to submit an alternative date or place for the proposed event before denying the application.

If an applicant wishes to appeal the DRC decision, a written notice shall be given to the DRC listing the reasons approval for the permit should be granted. The DRC shall review at the next meeting and issue a decision.

Should the applicant wish to appeal the DRC decision, a written notice of appeal shall be filed with the city manager within three business days after receipt or personal delivery of a notice of denial or permit conditions from the city. The written notice of appeal shall set forth the specific grounds for the appeal and attach any relevant documents for consideration.

1. Indemnification Agreement. Prior to the issuance of a permit for a special event not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the permit applicant and authorized officer of the sponsoring organization must agree to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by it in repairing damage to city property and indemnify, defend, and hold the city, its officers, employees, volunteers, and agents harmless from all causes of action, claims, or liabilities occurring in connection with the permitted event, except those which occur due to the city’s sole negligence.

a. Upon approval of an application for a permit for a special event not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the DRC shall provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of providing city personnel and equipment. The applicant/sponsor of the event shall be required to prepay these estimated costs for city services and equipment 10 days prior to the special event. City services and equipment may include the use of police officers and public employees for traffic and crowd control, pickup and delivery of traffic control devices, picnic tables, extraordinary street sweeping, and any other needed, requested, or required city services and the cost of operating the equipment to provide such services.

b. If the actual cost for city services and equipment on the date(s) of the event is less than the estimated cost, the applicant/sponsor will be refunded the difference by the city in a timely manner.

c. Permit fees and fees for the use of city services and equipment may be waived in part or in full by the city if in review of the application it is found that the event is of sufficient public benefit to warrant the expenditure of city funds without reimbursement by the applicant/sponsor and would not result in the private financial gain of any individual or “for-profit” entity.

The applicant/sponsor of an event, not protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, involving the sale of food or beverages for immediate consumption, erection of structures, horses or other large animals, water aid stations, or any other event likely to create a substantial need for cleanup, may be required to provide a cleanup deposit prior to the issuance of a special event permit.

The cleanup deposit may be returned after the event if the area used for the permitted event has been cleaned and restored to the same condition as existed prior to the event.

If the property used for the event has not been properly cleaned or restored, the applicant/sponsor shall be billed for the actual cost by the city for cleanup and restoration. The cleanup deposit shall be applied toward the payment of the bill.

H. Revocation of Permits. Any permit issued under this chapter may be summarily revoked by the city at any time when, by reason of disaster, public calamity, riot, or other emergency or exigent circumstances, the city determines the safety of the public or property requires such immediate revocation. The city may also summarily revoke any permit issued pursuant to this chapter if the city finds that the permit has been issued based upon false information or when the permittee exceeds the scope of the permit or fails to comply with any condition of the permit. Notice of such action revoking a permit shall be delivered in writing to the permittee by personal service or certified mail at the address specified by the permittee in the application or by any means approved by the applicant, such as email or telephone.

I. Violation – Penalty. It shall be unlawful for any person to sponsor or conduct a special event requiring a special event permit pursuant to this chapter unless a valid permit has been issued and remains in effect for the event. It is unlawful for any person to participate in such an event with the knowledge that the sponsor of the event has not been issued a required, valid permit or with knowledge that a once valid permit has expired or been revoked.

The special event permit authorizes the permittee/sponsor to conduct only such an event as is described in the permit, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit.

2. If the owner or agent of any premises has actual or constructive knowledge of the maintenance on or in their premises of any nuisance, as defined in this chapter, they shall be deemed one of the persons in control of the premises.

3. Any person creating, keeping, or maintaining any nuisance, or permitting, allowing, or suffering any nuisance to be maintained, who neglects or fails to abate or remove the nuisance within 24 hours next after so creating, keeping, or maintaining the nuisance or permitting, allowing, or suffering the same to be maintained, may, for each 24 hours thereafter during which the nuisance is continued, be charged with a separate violation of maintaining a public nuisance.

4. Any person creating, keeping, allowing, or maintaining any nuisance condition subsequent to any notice issued by the city to abate such nuisance condition shall be subject to abatement at the discretion of the city.

5. In the case of any violation of subsection (A)(1)(h) of this section (grass, weed or vegetation violation), the required abatement shall consist of mowing, plowing or otherwise removing such nuisance condition to not more than four inches above finished grade.

C. Violation.

1. Any action of any person, agent, firm, or corporation in violation of any provision of this chapter, or failure of any person, agent, firm, or corporation to perform any action or duty required pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall constitute a public nuisance and an infraction or a misdemeanor as defined in subsections (A)(1) and (2) of this section, and may be abated by the city as provided in this chapter. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from issuing a citation for such violation concurrent with any abatement action.

2. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from exercising its authority to protect the public peace and welfare by summarily abating any nuisance condition determined to be detrimental or an imminent threat to the public peace and welfare, or to protect the welfare of any person, animal, or property, without notice to any person.

3. Any citation written for the violation of any provision of this chapter shall contain an identification number or component to reflect the level of penalty established in subsection (F) of this section, consistent with the capability of the municipal court system.

D. Abatement.

1. Order. Upon the discovery of a nuisance, the community development director may order the owner or other person creating, keeping, maintaining, or permitting the same to abate it, and in default thereof to undertake the abatement on behalf of the city. At least 10 days before abatement commences, save in those cases of immediate necessity, the community development director shall notify the person creating, keeping, maintaining, or permitting the nuisance, the property owner, and any person in possession of the property, if known, of the city’s intentions. The notice shall be served personally or by some type of mail requiring a return receipt, and shall describe with particularity the nature of the violation and the sections of this chapter or other laws which are being violated, and shall specify a reasonable time within which the abatement must be accomplished.

2. Immediate. Whenever any nuisance condition is located within a public right-of-way or public easement, or of such a character and so situated that it can be abated without the invasion or destruction of private property, or the prejudice of any right thereof, the community development director and/or the public works director may summarily and immediately abate and remove the nuisance condition without further notice to any party.

3. By City – Safeguards. In any case where a nuisance is to be abated by the director, it shall be the duty of the community development director to proceed with due care and without unnecessary destruction of property. He shall in all cases be authorized to employ such assistance and adopt such means as may be necessary to effect the entire abatement of the nuisance, including access to private property reasonably necessary to abate such nuisance condition.

4. Costs. Every person, firm, or corporation maintaining a nuisance or permitting, allowing, or suffering a nuisance to be maintained, as prohibited by this chapter or otherwise, shall be liable for all costs and expenses for abating the same when the nuisance has been abated by the community development director. The costs and expenses will be assessed as a part of any prosecution against the party liable and may be recovered as other costs are recovered after they have been assessed; provided, that in such cases, the city shall have been liable in the first instance to pay all costs of the abatement. In all cases where the community development director abates any nuisance, he shall keep an account of all expenses attending such abatement. The community development director shall forward such costs to the finance manager, who shall certify them to the county treasurer for assessment on the tax rolls, and, in addition to other powers given in this chapter to collect such other costs and expenses, may forthwith bring suit for recovery of the costs in any court of competent jurisdiction, in the name of the city, against the person maintaining, keeping, creating, permitting, allowing, or suffering the nuisance abated, and, upon the collection of the costs by such suit, he shall pay the same to the finance manager.

E. Administrative Search Warrants. In the event the community development director has been denied access to any structure, dwelling unit, building, or property pursuant to existing city ordinances, he can at that time of denial of access obtain from the Chehalis municipal court a search warrant for the structure, dwelling unit, building, or property. Before an administrative search warrant is issued by the municipal court judge, the community development director must set forth by affidavit, under oath, the ordinance or ordinances upon which he is proceeding and state the circumstances upon which he is seeking the search warrant. If the municipal court judge finds that the community development director is proceeding under city ordinance, he shall issue an administrative search warrant for the search of the structure, dwelling unit, building, or property.

F. Penalties.

d. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from issuing a citation for such violation concurrent with any abatement action as authorized by this chapter.

2. The following sections of the MTO are not adopted by reference and are expressly deleted:

B. The term “public highway,” as used in RCW Title 46, shall include, but not be limited to, all public and private parking lots within the city limits.

C. “Parking space” shall mean any space which is duly designated for the parking of a single motor vehicle by lines painted or otherwise durably marked on the curb or on the surface of the street.

D. Blocking or Obstructing Alleys, Driveways, Sidewalks, or Traffic. The following traffic codes shall be in addition to the “Washington Model Traffic Ordinance,” Chapter 46.90 RCW. A person who violates any portion or subsection of this subsection is guilty of a traffic infraction.

1. Parking in Driveway Entrance or Alley Entrance. No person shall stand or park a vehicle in front of a public or private driveway within a street or alley or in front of, or in, an alley entrance or within five feet of the end of a constructed driveway return or alley entrance return, or if none, within five feet of the projection of the edge of the driveway or alley. Violation of this section constitutes a parking violation rather than a moving violation.

2. Parking in Alleys. No person shall stand or park any vehicle, except an authorized emergency vehicle, in any alley or alleyway for a period of time longer than is necessary for the expeditious loading, unloading, pick-up or delivery of materials from such vehicle.

Nor shall any person exit such vehicle when traffic will be unreasonably obstructed thereby, or when, in areas designated for angle parking, the vehicle is of such a length as to obstruct the sidewalk or the adjacent moving traffic lane. Proof that such traffic was blocked, obstructed, or interfered with shall be prima facie evidence that such blocking, obstructing, and interference were needless, unnecessary, and unwarranted. Violation of this section constitutes a parking violation rather than a moving traffic violation.

4. Blocking or Obstructing Traffic or Sidewalk – Occupied Vehicle. No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle and remain therein upon or along any street or highway in the city when traffic will be unreasonably obstructed. Violation of this section constitutes a moving violation rather than a parking violation (RCW 46.61.560).

B. A verification process is an independent method of determining that a signal from an automatic alarm system reflects a need for immediate police response. The verification process shall not take more than five minutes calculated from the time that the alarm signal has been accepted by an alarm system monitoring business until a decision is made whether to call for a police dispatch. The means of verification may include one or more of the following:

1. The establishment of voice communication with an authorized person at or near the premises who may indicate whether or not a need for immediate police response exists;

8.24.120 Suspension of police response.

A. As a penalty for continuous false alarm dispatches at a particular alarm site, alarm users may be subject to suspension of police response to future alarm activations.

After five false alarms within any 12-month period, the alarm administrator shall send written notification by regular mail to the alarm user that will contain the following information:

1. That five false alarms have occurred within a 12-month period;

a. Renovation of the alarm system by an alarm business or authorized service personnel;

b. Installation of new system; or

c. Material changes to the existing alarm system so as to reduce the number of false alarm activations.

B. Reinstatement of the alarm user, by written approval from the chief, shall nullify the previous five alarms and shall initiate a new 12-month period for purposes of calculating the number of false alarms pursuant to this chapter.

C. Unless there has been written approval by the chief reinstating the alarm user, the alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user upon the occurrence of the sixth false alarm by certified mail of the suspension of police response. The suspension of police response to an alarm user shall begin 10 days after the date of the written notification.

D. For purposes of this section, under a master alarm permit, each individual apartment unit will be considered a separate alarm site.

E. The order of suspension of police response may be appealed to the chief as set forth in this chapter. [Ord. 655B, 1999.]

B. Said document shall be used to provide consistent guidance to developers and property owners interested in developing or improving properties within the city, its urban growth area, and other associated service area boundaries. Said document shall delineate development processes, standards and requirements related to public utilities and infrastructure as established by city policies, codes and other adopted standards. [Ord. 785B § 14, 2005; Ord. 739B, 2003.]


12.04.020 Administration – Enforcement.

The administration and enforcement of this chapter, and the regulations adopted hereby, shall be as specified and provided within the adopted regulations. [Ord. 739B, 2003.]


12.04.030 Modification.

A. As regulations change or are enacted and conditions dictate, it is recognized that this document will have to be modified and changed from time to time to reflect the needs or requirements of the city.

B. Periodically, the public works director shall conduct a review and evaluation of conditions and standards. When it is determined that changes to this document are in order, the public works director shall present recommended changes to the city council for its consideration. [Ord. 739B, 2003.]


12.04.040 Standards.

The city adopts, by reference, “The Standard Specifications for Municipal Public Works Construction,” prepared by the Washington State Department of Transportation and the Washington State Chapter of the American Public Works Association as now enforced, or hereafter amended, as the official specifications for municipal public works construction for the city, and incorporates such standard specifications into the development engineering standards adopted by this chapter. [Ord. 739B, 2003.]

Article II. Administration


12.04.050 Applicability.

The guidelines and standards addressed in this document will apply to construction and improvement activities that take place within the right-of-way, or that impact the water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, sidewalk, street or transportation system, or other such activities within the city of Chehalis and the urban growth area (UGA) (see definitions). These standards will be considered reasonable minimum regulations unless a variance request is granted by the director of public works.

At this time, the city has no permitting, inspection or regulatory authority over the activities within the UGA except as they pertain to water and sewer service. However, the guidelines and standards addressed in this document are still applicable to development projects affecting public utilities and infrastructure within the UGA. In addition, the guidelines may be enforced at the time of annexation by the city for all new construction and improvement projects undertaken when these standards were in effect. An exception may be made if the nonconforming utility or infrastructure remains under private ownership rather than being accepted by the city.

These guidelines and standards will prevail in the event a conflict is found or identified with any other city practice or policy. [Ord. 785B § 14 (1.01), 2005.]

b. New single-family developments that are not part of contiguous, multiple single-family lots under sole ownership or that do not have existing frontage improvements abutting the property in question.

c. Any conversion or change in use of a development where the area being converted is less than 1,000 square feet and the change in use is not likely to result in 25 percent more vehicle trips during the peak traffic hours. Trip generation rates will be determined on the basis of the methodology set forth elsewhere in these standards.

d. Any remodeling of an existing building or development if no change in use or additional gross floor area results and the cost of the improvements or alterations is less than 25 percent of the value of the existing structures on the property.

e. Any cumulative addition of less than 1,000 square feet of gross floor area to a building or development as it existed on January 1, 2000.

E. Deferrals.

1. For all projects that are granted a deferral of any frontage improvement, the property owner of record will be required to enter into an agreement with the city to install the deferred improvements at some future date (refer to subsection (E)(4) of this section). This agreement will be recorded with the property to ensure the city’s ability to enforce the deferral regardless of changes in property ownership and will be enforceable as allowed by law. The property owner will execute and record a covenant document, as supplied by the city, ensuring participation of the subject property owner(s) in the construction of frontage improvements. The agreement will be effective for a period of 10 years from the date of recording, as allowed by RCW 35.42.182.

2. Any redevelopment project, regardless of location, that is necessitated by fire, flood, other natural disaster, or act of the public enemy will be granted a deferral from the installation of frontage improvements under the following conditions:

a. The redevelopment project is of the same size, type, and usage as existed on the property prior to the damage.

b. There are no negative impacts to the health, safety, or welfare of the public or environment that will be created or perpetuated by the delay of the frontage improvements.

c. If the property is located on a street requiring mandatory frontage improvements as defined in these standards, the deferral will be for a period of three years from the time of completion of the redevelopment project. At that time, the property owner will install the deferred improvements.

3. In certain circumstances it may not be appropriate to require the installation of frontage improvements at the time a development occurs. The director of public works may authorize a deferral of any or all required frontage improvements, as defined by these standards, provided one or more of the following conditions are met:

a. The design grade and alignment of the abutting street cannot be determined at the time of construction of the development.

b. The installation of frontage improvements required for the development would create or intensify a hazard to public safety or health.

c. The installation of required frontage improvements would be inconsistent with the city’s long-range street or utility master plans.

d. The cost of the frontage improvement construction is greater than 25 percent of the entire development project cost, unless necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public or environment. (The costs will be calculated by the owner’s representative and approved by the director of public works.)

4. The city will initiate deferred frontage improvements under the following specific guidelines:

a. Deferred frontage improvements will be initiated by the city no sooner than three years from the date the deferral is granted, unless the property in question is part of a local improvement district (LID) formed for the purpose of constructing the deferred improvement or a health or safety issue comes to exist as a result of the need for the deferred improvement.

b. If the city or other entity initiates a project in the vicinity of the property where the improvement was deferred, the improvement may be initiated if related to the work that will be performed.

c. The deferral is valid for a period of 10 years. If the improvement is not initiated within that period, the deferral will lapse and the property owner will no longer be bound by the conditions of the deferral. A lapsed deferral does not exclude a property owner from participation in an LID. [Ord. 819B § 14, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.07), 2005.]


12.04.120 Variances.

A. Purpose. Any applicant may seek modification of the provisions of these standards where it appears that extraordinary conditions of topography, access, location, shape, size, drainage or other physical features of the site or adjacent development exist.

B. Application Procedure. Any development plan that includes a request for a variance to one or more of the requirements of these standards must be accompanied by a statement detailing any such variance(s) and the reasons therefor. Variance requests must include the technical aspects of a specific project that necessitates the need for a variance. A variance from the development engineering standards will not be granted based solely on financial or convenience issues. Upon receiving a variance request, the director of public works will review the information presented and make a determination as to the merits of the request. Upon completion of the review, the petitioner will be notified in writing of the director’s decision.

C. Conditions. No variance will be authorized that would have the effect of granting a special privilege not shared by other properties in the same vicinity. To grant a variance(s), the director of public works will determine whether the following conditions have been met:

1. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions that apply only to the property referred to in the application and not to other properties in the vicinity. These include, but are not limited to, size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings. The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights of the petitioner.

2. The granting of the application will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, adversely affect the health or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the property referred to in the application and will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood or adversely affect the comprehensive plan. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.08), 2005.]


12.04.130 Latecomers agreements.

A. Any person who constructs a water or sewer main extension or other public improvement in excess of that which is required to meet minimum development engineering standards and the needs of the development may, with the approval of the city council, enter into a contract with the city which will allow the developer to be reimbursed for the portion of the construction cost that benefits other adjoining properties and/or is in excess of the minimum standards. This contract is commonly termed a “latecomers agreement.” The latecomers agreement should be submitted for review prior to plan approval. However, a latecomers agreement may be presented during the project as long as it is presented prior to any water and/or sewer connection application approvals. Latecomers agreements will not be accepted after any water and/or sewer connection application related to the project has been received and the fees paid. Latecomers agreements will be valid for a period of time as established by the Revised Code of Washington (RCW).

B. The developer is responsible for initiating, executing and, after council approval, filing the latecomers agreement. Any application for a latecomers agreement shall contain:

1. A legal description of the applicant’s property;

2. A legal description of all benefiting properties;

3. Maps of the applicant’s property, the benefiting properties and the location of the improvement and/or improvements;

4. Estimated itemized cost documentation.

C. The city will collect the approved latecomers fee from persons connecting to the water or sewer extension and subsequently forward payment to the developer. The city will only allow the reimbursement of “reasonable” construction costs. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.09), 2005.]


12.04.140 Standards enforcement.

A. Plan Review. All plans and reports are to be submitted to the community development department. All necessary easements, dedications, contracts, agreements or bonds will be submitted for review along with the plans. The development review committee (DRC) will check the plans for completeness against the plan checklist. If plans meet the minimum checklist requirements, they will be routed to appropriate city staff and the plan review process will begin. Two plan reviews will be conducted at no additional charge as part of the plan review process.

If plans require a third submittal, additional fees may be levied as established by resolution of the city council. “Third submittal” will mean the third and any subsequent submittals of construction drawings, specifications, drainage calculations or other information requiring additional plan checking pertaining to public facilities or any applicable construction or development in the right-of-way. New review comments provided by the city, not related to changes/corrections from the engineer, will not trigger “third submittal” requirements.

Upon approval of the plans, the engineer will be requested to submit the original drawings for signature by the director of public works, or his duly appointed representative. Approved plans will be returned only to the engineer and only after all applicable fees have been paid. The plan approval will typically be valid for one year. During that time, the project proponent will not be responsible to update the plans in accordance with any new standards that may be developed, other than as necessary to preserve the health and welfare of the public. If a project has not been initiated and substantially completed upon plan expiration, any new requirements that have been adopted by the city will be applicable.

Plans that have been approved more than one year prior to construction beginning (i.e., a preconstruction meeting scheduled and inspection fees paid) will be subject to subsequent review and additional fees may be levied as established for a “third submittal.”

B. Inspection. All construction or work within the scope of this code and all construction or work for which a permit is required will be subject to inspection by the public works department or designated consultant or duly appointed designee, in accordance with and in the manner provided by this code.

It is the responsibility of the contractor to notify the engineering division two business days in advance of the commencement of any authorized work. Failure to provide sufficient advance notice as noted in these standards may lead to a delay in the start of construction. In such cases, the city accepts no liability for construction delays.

All specific tests and inspections required by these standards or necessitated by the unique nature of a project will be performed at the contractor’s expense. In addition, one reinspection will be granted at no cost. Noncompliant or unsatisfactory work may result in additional inspection(s) and additional fees as established by resolution.

C. Construction Control. Work performed for the construction or improvement of city streets and utilities, whether by or for a private developer, by city forces, or by a city contractor, will be done in accordance with approved plans. No work is to begin until such plans have been approved. The director of public works and the public works department or designated consultant must approve any revision to such plans prior to implementation. Failure to receive prior approval of plans and/or revisions may result in removal or modification of construction at the expense of the contractor or developer.

D. Violations. It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, convert, equip, use or maintain any frontage improvements/public utilities or cause or permit the same to be done in violation of this code.

E. Abatement. All frontage improvements and infrastructure that are determined, after inspection by the city, to not comply or meet minimum standards as defined in this code, will be abated by repair, rehabilitation or removal. A correction notice may be issued by the city to define the work that must be adjusted.

F. Appeals. In order to provide for reasonable interpretation of the provisions of this code and to hear appeals provided for hereunder, appeals must initially be addressed to the director of public works. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 810B § 6, 2006; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.10), 2005.]


12.04.150 Permits.

A. A right-of-way permit will be obtained from the engineering division before any person, firm or corporation will:

1. Commence any work to alter, construct, or repair any facilities within a public right-of-way or easement, including but not limited to: pavement, sidewalk, utilities, conduits, vaults, or any other structure, utility or improvement located over, under or upon a public right-of-way or easement in the city of Chehalis; or

2. Place any structure, building, barricade, or materials tending to cause a dangerous situation or obstruct, damage, or disturb the free use of the right-of-way or any improvement situated therein.

B. A separate permit will be obtained for each separate project. The timeline for a right-of-way permit will depend upon the needs of the project. However, the city will also factor the health, safety, and welfare of the community when determining the allowable time for a permit to remain valid. In no case will right-of-way permits be issued for longer than one year. Upon expiration of a permit, a new permit request may be submitted for consideration by the engineering division.

C. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans, specifications, and computations will not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this code or of any other ordinance of the jurisdiction. Permits appearing to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code or other ordinances of the jurisdiction will not be valid.

D. The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications, and other data will not prevent the engineering division from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications, and other data, or from preventing operations being carried on when in violation of this code or of any other ordinances of this jurisdiction.

E. The city may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of this code.

F. Much of the work covered under these standards will require multiple permit authority reviews and approvals. Several types of permits and approvals require prior approval from the authority before a building or other permit can be issued. Any questions regarding information about permits, approvals and agreements should be directed to the community development director. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.11), 2005.]


12.04.160 Design standards.

A. Detailed plans prepared by a licensed engineer must be submitted to the engineering division for review and approval prior to the commencement of any construction. The applicant’s engineer will be a professional engineer registered as such in the state of Washington. All plans must be signed and stamped by the applicant’s engineer prior to submittal for plan review. The city will review all submittals for general compliance with these standards. An acceptance by the city does not relieve the applicant or the applicant’s engineer from the responsibility of ensuring that all facilities are safe and that calculations, plans, specifications, construction, and as-built drawings comply with normal engineering standards, these standards, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and codes.

Final plans must be signed and approved by the director of public works prior to the start of construction. The applicant will provide the city with two full-sized copies, and two 11-inch by 17-inch copies. Plans will be clearly marked as record documents with no disclaimers and conform to CMC 12.04.170, Drafting standards. An electronic or digital copy in an AutoCAD-readable format will be submitted with the mylar plan set. It is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure that a signed and approved set of plans and all necessary permits are on the job site whenever work is being performed.

The director of public works must also approve any subsequent revisions to the plans deemed significant by the engineering division. Failure to secure director approval for plan modifications may lead to corrective actions undertaken at the expense of the developer. The city may seek reimbursement for staff and material costs associated with any rework necessitated by unapproved modifications.

B. Materials proposed for use in construction of publicly owned or maintained utilities must be in conformance with approved material standards in place at the time of submittal. Alternate materials will not be evaluated or considered during the plan review period.

C. Four copies of plans must be submitted along with a completed plan checklist. All drawings will be either a 22-inch by 34-inch or 24-inch by 36-inch sheet size.

D. Plan and profile drawings are required for all proposed transportation-related improvements; street illumination; traffic signalization; storm drainage facilities; or sewer and water improvements. For specific minimum requirements, see the plan checklist at the end of this article. On occasion, the scope of a project (i.e., installation of a driveway, replacement of sidewalk, or replacement of sanitary side sewer) may not require engineered plans and can be handled via a right-of-way permit, as determined by the the public works department or designated consultant.

E. Specifications will be required and submitted with the plans if general notes do not adequately cover the project requirements. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.12), 2005.]


12.04.170 Drafting standards.

A. All plans submitted for either design approval or permanent record will be free of photographs or stick-ons. Shading or hatching may be acceptable if the pattern is not excessively dense and does not compromise readability.

B. Design drawings will be submitted on clean, legible blue or black line format. Half-size drawings may be submitted for design review if prior authorization is granted by the public works department or designated consultant. Half-size drawings will be 11 inches by 17 inches and will be in a format that can be scaled using a standard engineer’s scale.

C. As-built drawings will conform to the plan checklist and be submitted on static-free four-mil mylar with permanent image, and three sets of blue line copies. Sheet size will be 22 inches by 34 inches or 24 inches by 36 inches. No sepia will be accepted.

D. Plans will be prepared with the understanding that each may be microfilmed. Minimum nominal text size will be one-eighth inch.

E. No engineering plans will be accepted with architect’s scale.

F. Street drawings will be either one inch equals five feet, one inch equals 10 feet, one inch equals 20 feet, or one inch equals 30 feet horizontal with vertical not to exceed one inch equals 10 feet. Utility drawings may be accepted at one inch equals 50 feet or one inch equals 40 feet if they are legible and able to be microfilmed.

G. Plans will show all existing and proposed monuments. All monuments will be described using current city of Chehalis coordinates. Centerline of roadways, easements (with type and dimensions), and other pertinent data will be referenced to existing monuments.

H. All existing features (pipes, curbs, power poles, etc.) are to be produced with a small pen or half-tones. Proposed features will be distinguished by a larger or bolder line weight.

I. Different line types will be used to distinguish different features. For example: centerline and right-of-way will have different line types.

J. It will be noted that the preceding guidelines should not be construed to be the only requirements for completed drawings, but rather an outline of minimum requirements for submitting complete drawings for the city’s review. Particular care should be exercised in the preparation of the plans to ensure their completeness and clarity that will facilitate a timely response following the city’s review. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.13), 2005.]


12.04.180 Fees.

Fees, charges or bonding requirements will be as established by an ordinance passed by the city council except where specifically set forth in the CMC. The city council will further set the dollar penalty for failure to pay said fee or charge in a timely manner by passage of such ordinance.

All plan check fees are due prior to the release of approved plans and all inspection fees are due at the time of the preconstruction meeting. In addition, there are various miscellaneous service and connection fees and charges. Applicants should request an estimate of these fees and charges from the city’s community development director as soon as practical.

Prior to physical connection to and use of city water and sewer systems, all public works improvements must be completed and approved and all applicable fees paid. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.14), 2005.]


12.04.190 Bonding.

A. Bonds or other allowable securities may be required by the city to guarantee the performance or maintenance of required work. The type and amount of security will be consistent with the required work and approved by the city attorney. Types of securities include, but are not limited to, a bond with a surety qualified to do a bonding business in this state, a cash deposit, an assigned savings account, or a set-aside letter.

B. Performance Bond. No development permits will be issued until all required improvements are reflected in the approved civil engineering plans. Exceptions to this requirement must be submitted in writing to the director of public works. Upon completion of building construction and with the approval of the director of public works, appropriate surety for minor civil work may be accepted and a performance bond posted with the city. The performance bond must be in an amount equal to 150 percent of the cost of the improvements. [Ord. 785B § 14 (1.15), 2005.]


12.04.200 Utility locations.

A. Utilities within a right-of-way or easement on new roads or in roadways where existing utilities are not in conflict will be located in accordance with these standards as approved by the public works director. Where existing utilities are in place, new utilities will conform to these standards as nearly as practical and yet be compatible with the existing installations. All deviations of location must be approved by the director of public works. Existing utilities will be shown using the best information available. This verification may require exploration/excavation (potholing) if utilities are in conflict with proposed design. The contractor/developer will be responsible for utility locations in conjunction with their project.

B. All new utilities other than those located on private property will be installed underground by the utility owning said facility and new and existing facilities will comply with provisions as set forth in these standards and/or in the applicable franchise agreement.

C. A right-of-way permit is required of any utility, except city-owned facilities and utilities, with a franchise agreement with the city for all work done within the right-of-way. The utility will comply with all provisions as set forth in these standards. [Ord. 785B § 14 (1.16), 2005.]


12.04.210 Utility extensions.

See CMC 12.04.370, 12.04.570, 13.04.520 and 13.08.530. [Ord. 858B § 1, 2010; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.17), 2005.]


12.04.220 Easements.

A. Publicly owned utilities on privately owned lands are generally not permitted unless a benefit to the public or the utility system can be demonstrated. Where public utilities and/or their conveyance systems are permitted to cross private lands, an easement must be granted to the city. The engineering division will generally process, record and file all easements. If the property is platted, the easement may be conveyed when the short plat or final plat is filed. All easements not shown on a plat must be prepared by a land surveyor or engineering firm, licensed by the state of Washington, and able to perform such work.

B. Easement widths will typically be 20 feet. Construction easements will be a minimum of 30 feet wide, including the permanent easement. Under special circumstances, the public works department or designated consultant may require alternate easement widths.

C. Easements are required to be submitted in draft form, unsigned, for review and approval prior to plan approval. Signed copies are required prior to final acceptance of the project and issuance of certificate of occupancy. Any change in design that places an amenity, i.e., water, sewer, sidewalk, etc., outside of the easement may necessitate stopping of construction until plans and easements can be resubmitted and approved. Easements will be filed by the city upon satisfactory completion of the work. [Ord. 819B §§ 13, 15, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.18), 2005.]


12.04.230 Annexation agreement requirement.

Owners of properties lying outside city boundaries must sign an annexation agreement that legally commits their property to eventual annexation prior to being served by city utilities (Resolution Nos. 7-76 and 8-81). This annexation agreement requirement will be applied to all extensions of city utilities to areas outside the city limits. [Ord. 785B § 14 (1.19), 2005.]


12.04.240 Traffic control.

A. The contractor/developer will be responsible for interim traffic control during construction on or along traveled roadways. Traffic control will follow the guidelines of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications. All barricades, signs, coning and flagging will conform to the requirements of the MUTCD. A traffic control plan will be submitted and approved by the public works department prior to the start of construction.

City utilities constructed within the Lewis County right-of-way will follow all traffic control requirements set forth by the Lewis County department of public works and MUTCD.

Signs must be legible and visible and will be removed at the end of each work day if not applicable after construction hours.

All necessary and/or required traffic control devices will be in place prior to the beginning of project construction, or on a daily basis during project construction.

B. When road closures and detours cannot be avoided, the contractor/developer will notify the public works department and the engineering division a minimum of two business days in advance. The city may require that a detour plan be prepared and submitted for approval prior to closing any portion of a city roadway. The engineering division will notify the fire department of potential road closures.

C. A right-of-way permit is required and must be obtained before any work in the street can commence. [Ord. 785B § 14 (1.20), 2005.]


12.04.250 Call before you dig.

All contractors/developers are responsible for timely notification of all utilities in advance of any construction in the right-of-way or utility easements. The Utilities Underground Location Center telephone number is 1-800-424-5555. A minimum of two business days’ advance notice is required. The contractor/developer must provide separate notification to any utility not participating in or using the Utilities Underground Location Center. [Ord. 785B § 14 (1.21), 2005.]


12.04.260 Plan checklist.

The plan checklist in this section provides a list of the information that is to be included on the plans submitted to the engineering division for review. Although the list is not all-inclusive, it should serve as a general guide for reference purposes. Not all items listed will apply in all situations. The checklist should be completed by the applicant and included with all plan submissions.

[Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (1.22), 2005.]

Article III. Transportation


12.04.270 General considerations.

This article provides minimum development standards supplementing the applicable standards as set forth in Article II of this chapter, and to encourage uniform development of an integrated, fully accessible public transportation system that will facilitate present and future travel demands with minimal environmental impact to the community as a whole. [Ord. 785B § 14 (2A), 2005.]


12.04.280 Streets.

A. General. City streets are classified as arterials, collectors and local access streets in accordance with regional transportation needs and the functional use each serves. Function is the controlling element for classification and will govern right-of-way, street width, and street geometries. The public works department or designated consultant will determine the classification of new streets.

Street design must provide for the maximum loading conditions anticipated. The width and grade of the pavement must conform to specific standards set forth herein for safety and uniformity. See Table I, Minimum Street Standards.

B. Design Standards. The design of streets and roads will depend upon their type and usage. The design elements of city streets will conform to these standards as set forth herein and current design practices as set forth in Article II of this chapter.

The layout of streets will provide for the continuation of existing principal streets in adjoining subdivisions or of their proper projection when adjoining property is not subdivided. Minor streets, which serve primarily to provide access to abutting property, will be designed to discourage through traffic. See Table I, Minimum Street Standards.

Table I. Minimum Street Standards

	*Maximum superelevation – 6%.

**Any grade exceeding 12% must be located on straight sections of street.

***Standard curb is required if sidewalk is within eight feet of EOP, otherwise no curb requirement.

1. Alignment of major arterials, minor arterials and collectors will conform as nearly as possible with that shown in the comprehensive plan.

2. Grade. Street grade should conform closely to the natural contour of the land. In some cases the public works department or designated consultant may require a different grade. The minimum allowable grade will be one-half percent. The maximum allowable grade will be eight to 15 percent depending on the street classification.

3. Width. The pavement and right-of-way width will depend on the street classification. Table I, Minimum Street Standards, shows the minimum widths allowed.

The general notes that follow will be included on any plans dealing with street design in addition to all other applicable requirements.

General Notes (Street Construction)

1.    All workmanship and materials will be in accordance with city of Chehalis standards and the most recent edition of the State of Washington Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction.

2.    The contractor will be responsible for all traffic control in accordance with MUTCD. Prior to disruption of any traffic, traffic control plans must be prepared and submitted to the city for approval. No work will commence until all approved traffic control plans are in place.

3.    All curb and gutter, street grades, sidewalk grades, and any other vertical and/or horizontal alignment will be staked by an engineering or surveying firm capable of performing such work.

4.    Where new asphalt joins existing, the existing asphalt will be cut to a neat vertical edge and tacked with asphalt emulsion type CSS-1 in accordance with the Standard Specifications. The new asphalt will be feathered back over existing to provide for a seal at the saw cut location and the joint sealed with grade AR-4000W paving asphalt.

5.    Compaction of subgrade, rock and asphalt will be in accordance with the Standard Specifications.

6.    Form and subgrade inspection by city inspectors is required before pouring concrete. Twenty-four hours’ (one work day) advance notice is required for form inspection.

7.    Testing and sampling frequencies are described in these standards.

8.    The public works department will install or oversee the installation of street name and regulatory signs at the contractor’s and/or the developer’s expense. All street name and regulatory signs will be requested and approved by the city prior to the start of construction.

C. Naming. Streets will be designated according to specific criteria. All streets north of Main Street and west of Market Boulevard/National Avenue are designated as Northwest (N.W.). All streets north of Main Street and east of Market Boulevard/National Avenue are designated as Northeast (N.E.). All streets lying south of Main Street and west of Market Boulevard are designated as Southwest (S.W.). All streets south of Main Street and east of Market Boulevard are designated as Southeast (S.E.). “Streets” and “avenues” usually lie perpendicular to each other.

“Avenues” generally run north/south and “streets” run east/west. “Drives” are irregular or diagonal streets over two grid blocks in length not conforming to the grid pattern. “Places” run north/south, parallel to but between avenues. “Ways” run east/west, parallel to but between streets. “Courts” are cul-de-sacs that cannot be extended. “Lanes” are private streets.

An address number will be assigned to all new buildings at the time a building permit is issued. It is then the development permit holder’s responsibility to make sure that the numbers are placed clearly and visibly at the main entrance to the property or at the principal place of ingress.

The developer must check with the community development director regarding the naming of streets. This should be done at the time the preliminary plat is submitted and again upon approval of the final plat. This will ensure that the name assigned to a new street is consistent with city policy.

D. Signing and Striping. Street signs are defined as any regulatory, warning, or guide signs. The developer is responsible for the cost of all street signs. Street signs will comply with the latest edition of the U.S. Department of Transportation Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

Pavement markings and street signs, including poles and hardware, will be paid for by the developer, but will be designed, furnished and installed by the city or by the developer under the city’s direction, to establish and maintain uniformity. The public works department will determine whether pavement markings and street signs will be provided by the city or by the developer. If the work is to be performed by the city, the developer must submit a written request to public works and the developer will then be billed upon completion of the work.

1. Standards for Sign Post Material.

	Post	2" x length x 14-gauge perforated square tube

	Anchor	2-1/4" x 36" x 12-gauge

	Sleeve	2-1/2" x 12" x 12-guage

	Corner bolt with 2 bends and nut

	Aluminum drive rivets – 3/8" for mounting signs

2. Standards for Pavement Markings.

a. Legends, arrows, symbols and crosswalks must be heat-fused preformed thermoplastic Hot Tape or Premark.

b. Striping Material.

i. Arterial streets – Dura-Stripe;

ii. Collector streets – Paint.

E. Right-of-Way. Right-of-way is determined by the functional classification of a street. Refer to Table I, Minimum Street Standards.

Right-of-way requirements may be increased if a traffic impact analysis indicates that additional lanes, pockets, transit lanes, bus loading zones, operational speed, bike lanes, utilities, or other such improvements are required.

Right-of-way will be conveyed to the city on a recorded plat or by a right-of-way dedication deed.

F. Private Streets.

1. Private streets may be allowed under the following conditions:

a. Permanently established by tract or lot providing legal access to serve not more than four dwelling units or businesses on separate parcels, or unlimited dwelling units or businesses situated on a single parcel and sufficient to accommodate required improvements, to include provisions for future use by adjacent property owners when applicable; and

b. Have a minimum 20-foot paved surface, and a sidewalk five feet in width of such a design that prevents parking on the sidewalk; and

c. Accessible at all times for emergency and public service vehicle use; and

d. Will not result in the land-locking of present or future parcels nor obstruct public street circulation; and

e. Covenants have been approved, recorded, and verified with the city that provide for maintenance of the private streets and associated parking areas by the owner or homeowners’ association or other legal entity.

2. Acceptance as Public Street. Acceptance of private streets as public streets will be considered only if provision is made for the street(s) to meet all applicable public street standards, including right-of-way widths.

G. Street Frontage Improvements.

1. All commercial and residential (including multifamily) development, plats, and short plats will install street frontage improvements at the time of construction as required by the standards. Such improvements may include curb and gutter; sidewalk; street storm drainage; street lighting system; traffic signal modification, relocation or installation; utility relocation; landscaping and irrigation; and street widening per these standards. Plans will be prepared and signed by a licensed civil engineer registered in the state of Washington.

2. All frontage improvements will be made across full frontage of property and on all sides that may border a city right-of-way.

3. Exceptions. See CMC 12.04.110(D), Exceptions.

H. Cul-de-Sac. Streets designed to have one end permanently closed will be no longer than 400 feet. At the closed end, there will be a widened “bulb” having a minimum paved traveled radius as shown in Table I, Minimum Street Standards.

I. Half-Street.

1. A half-street is an otherwise acceptable roadway section modified to conform to limited right-of-way on the boundary of property subject to development. A resulting minimum 20-foot-wide paved surface is required.

2. A half-street may be approved by the director of public works when all of the following conditions are met:

a. There is reasonable assurance of obtaining the prescribed additional right-of-way from the adjoining property suitable for completion of a full-section roadway; and

b. Such alignment is consistent with or will establish a reasonable circulation pattern; and

c. The right-of-way width of the half-street will equal at least 30 feet or 50 percent of the required right-of-way (whichever is greater); and

d. The traveled way will be surfaced the same as the designated street classification to a width not less than 24 feet; and

e. The half-street will be graded consistent with the centerline of the ultimate roadway section along the property line; and

f. Property line edge of street will be finished with permanent curb and gutter to ensure proper drainage, bank stability and traffic safety; and

g. Required frontage improvements will be installed in conjunction with the half-street.

J. Medians. A median will be in addition to, not part of, the specified roadway width except on a road classified as a boulevard. Medians will be designed so as not to limit turning radius or sight distance at intersections.

K. Intersections.

1. Traffic control will be as specified in the most recent edition of the MUTCD or as modified by the director of public works as a result of appropriate traffic engineering studies.

2. Street intersections will be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. Sharp-angled intersections will be avoided. For reasons of traffic safety, a “T” intersection (three-legged) is preferable to the crossroad (four-legged) intersection for local access streets. For safe design, the following types of intersection features should be avoided:

a. Intersections with more than four intersecting streets;

b. “Y” type intersections where streets meet at acute angles;

c. Intersections adjacent to bridges and other sight obstructions;

d. Offset intersections that are not conducive to side traffic flow.

In no case will the angle of the intersection be less than 60 degrees nor greater than 120 degrees. The preferred angle is 90 degrees.

3. Spacing between adjacent intersecting streets, whether crossing or “T,” should be as follows:

	When highest classification involved is:	Minimum centerline offset should be:

	Major arterial	350 feet

	Minor arterial	300 feet

	Commercial collector	200 feet

	Neighborhood collector	200 feet

	Local access	150 feet

When different classes of streets intersect, the higher standard will apply on curb radii. Deviations may be allowed if the public works department or designated consultant determines that strict compliance with the standards is impractical or unreasonable in the circumstance.

4. On sloping approaches at an intersection, landings will be provided with a grade not to exceed a one-foot difference in elevation for a distance of 30 feet approaching any arterial, or 20 feet approaching a collector or local access street, measured from the nearest right-of-way line (extended) of intersecting street.

L. Driveways.

1. All abandoned driveway areas on the same frontage will be removed and the curbing and sidewalk or shoulder and ditch section will be properly restored.

2. All driveways will be constructed of Portland cement concrete (PCC) or asphalt from the right-of-way line to the edge of the street. PCC driveways will be subject to the same testing and inspection requirements as curb, gutter, and sidewalk construction. Residential PCC driveways will have a nominal concrete thickness of six inches. All other PCC approaches will be eight inches thick.

3. Joint-use driveways serving two adjacent parcels may be built on their common boundary with a formal written agreement between both property owners and with the approval of the city. The agreement will be a recorded easement for both parcels of land specifying joint usage.

4. Grade breaks, including the tie to the roadway, will be constructed as smooth vertical curves. The maximum change in driveway grade will be eight percent within any 10 feet of distance on a crest and 12 percent within any 10 feet of distance in a sag vertical curve.

5. No commercial driveway will be approved where backing onto the sidewalk or street would occur.

6. Driveways will be separated by 20 feet of straight curb between each driveway providing access to a parcel or parcels of land unless the public works department or designated consultant determines that strict compliance with the standards is impractical or unreasonable in the circumstance.

7. No driveway will be built within 15 feet of the end of any curb return or within five feet of any property line unless the public works department or designated consultant determines that strict compliance with the standards is impractical or unreasonable in the circumstance.

8. Driveway Widths.

a. The maximum driveway width for a single driveway onto an arterial or collector will be:

	Frontage Width	Residential	Commercial	Industrial

	Up to 50 feet	24 feet	24 feet	24 feet

	50 to 75 feet	24 feet	30 feet	30 feet

	More than 75 feet	30 feet	30 feet	35 feet

b. The maximum driveway width for each of two driveways onto an arterial or collector will be:

	Frontage Width	Residential	Commercial	Industrial

	Up to 50 feet	not permitted	not

permitted	not permitted

	50 to 75 feet	20 feet	20 feet	24 feet

	More than 75 feet	20 feet	24 feet	24 feet

c. The maximum driveway width for a single driveway onto a local access street will be:

	Frontage Width	Residential	Commercial	Industrial

	Up to 50 feet	24 feet	26 feet	not permitted

	50 to 75 feet	24 feet	26 feet	not permitted

	More than 75 feet	24 feet	26 feet	not permitted

d. The maximum driveway width for each of two driveways onto a local access street will be:

	Frontage Width	Residential	Commercial	Industrial

	Up to 50 feet	not permitted	not

permitted	not permitted

	50 to 75 feet	20 feet	20 feet	not permitted

	More than 75 feet	20 feet	24 feet	not permitted

e. The maximum driveway width for one-way driveways will be:

	Frontage Width	Residential	Commercial	Industrial

	Up to 50 feet	14 feet	22 feet	22 feet

	50 to 75 feet	14 feet	22 feet	22 feet

	More than 75 feet	14 feet	22 feet	22 feet

f. A road approach or wider driveway may be approved by the director of public works or designated consultant when a substantial percentage of oversized vehicle traffic exists, when divisional islands are desired, or when multiple exit or entrance lanes are needed.

9. Arterial Street Access.

a. No driveway may access an arterial street within 75 feet (measured along the arterial) of any other such access to the street on either side of the travel way but may be allowed at locations directly opposite another point of access.

b. No driveway access will be allowed to an arterial street within 150 feet of the nearest right-of-way line of an intersecting street.

c. Within the limitations set forth above, access to arterial streets within the city will be limited to one driveway for each tract of property separately owned. Properties contiguous to each other and owned by the same person are considered to be one tract.

d. Driveways giving direct access onto arterials may be denied if alternate access is available. The director of public works may permit deviations from this requirement if sufficient justification is provided.

e. Road approaches and/or ingress and egress tapers may be required in industrial and commercially zoned areas as directed by the director of public works. Tapers will be designed per the most recent edition of “Transportation and Land Development” by V.G. Stover and F. Koepke.

M. Sight Obstruction.

1. The following sight clearance requirements take into account the proportional relationship between speed and stopping distance.

2. The sight distance area is a clear-view triangle formed on all intersections by extending two lines of specified length (A) and (B) as shown in subsection (M)(3)(b) of this section, Uncontrolled Intersection, from the center of the intersecting streets along the centerlines of both streets and connecting those endpoints to form the hypotenuse of the triangle. Refer to Standard Drawing 2-1 at the end of this chapter. The area within the triangle will be subject to said restrictions to maintain a clear view on the intersection approaches.

3. Sight Distance Triangle.

a. Stop- or Yield-Controlled Intersection. Providing adequate sight distance from a street or driveway is one of the most important considerations to ensure safe street and driveway operation. The intersection sight distance criteria given in the following table is based on line B-1 shown in Figure IX-40 of “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets” published by AASHTO. This table applies to all intersections as well as driveways with an ADT greater than 20. For driveways with an ADT of 20 or less, the stopping sight distance in Table III-1 of the AASHTO publication can be used.

	Operating Speed (MPH)	Sight Distance

	Intersection Sight Distance	Stopping Sight Distance

	2 Lanes	4+ Lanes

	20	210	230	125

	25	255	280	150

	30	310	340	200

	35	355	390	250

	40	410	450	325

Other factors such as vertical and horizontal curves and roadway grades also need to be taken into account. Such factors can require necessary modification to the intersection sight distance given in the above table.

Sight distance is measured from a point on the minor road or driveway 15 feet from the edge (extended) of the major road pavement (or nearest traffic lane if parking is permitted) and from a height of 3.50 feet on the minor road to a height of object of 4.25 feet on the major road.

b. Uncontrolled Intersection.

	Operating Speed (MPH)	Sight Distance

	Major Street (A)	Minor Street (B)

	20	90	90

	25	110	110

	30	130	130

	35	155	155

	40	180	180

c. Vertical Clearance. The area within the sight distance triangle will be free from obstructions to a motor vehicle operator’s view between a height of two and one-half feet and 10 feet above the existing surface of the street.

d. Exclusions. Sight obstructions that may be excluded from these requirements include: fences in conformance with this chapter, utility poles, regulatory signs, trees trimmed from the base to a height of 10 feet above the street, places where the contour of the ground is such that there can be no cross-visibility at the intersection, saplings or plant species of open growth habits and not in the form of a hedge that are so planted and trimmed as to leave a clear and unobstructed cross-view during all seasons, buildings constructed in conformance with the provisions of appropriate zoning regulations and preexisting buildings.

N. Surfacing Requirements. The following are the surfacing requirements for each application listed:

1. Asphalt Pavements. The minimum pavement sections listed in Standard Drawing 2-2 are in lieu of pavement design and are based on a subgrade California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of three. Alternate pavement designs will be accepted based on soil tests to determine the actual CBR value and completion of the worksheet on Standard Drawing 2-3 at the end of this chapter. Soil tests and a completed worksheet for each road classification will accompany plans submitted if other than the structures shown below and pavement sections in Standard Drawing 2-2 are used. One soil sample per each 500 linear feet of centerline, with a minimum of three per project, representative of the roadway subgrade, will be taken to determine a statistical representation of the existing soil conditions.

An engineering firm that specializes in soils analysis will perform the soil tests. The report, signed and stamped by a professional engineer licensed by the state of Washington, must be based on actual soils tests and submitted with the plans. All depths indicated are minimum compacted depths.

Existing pavement restoration: for utility or street-widening projects requiring restoration of existing pavement, additional information and design calculations will be required to ensure that the pavement will need minimal maintenance for five to seven years. The information required may include:

a. Pavement cores representative of typical pavement sections; and

b. Statement of existing pavement condition and discussion of how it will “match up” to the new pavement section.

2. Sidewalks.

a. Surfacing: four inches commercial concrete;

b. Base: two inches crushed surfacing top course or well-graded sand;

c. Asphalt sidewalks will not be permitted.

3. Concrete Driveway.

a. Surfacing: six inches commercial concrete for residential; eight inches commercial concrete for all others;

b. Base: two inches crushed surfacing top course or well-graded sand.

4. Asphalt Driveway.

a. Surfacing: three inches Class B asphalt concrete for residential; six inches Class B asphalt concrete for all others;

b. Base: four inches ballast.

O. Temporary Street Patching. Temporary restoration of trenches will be accomplished by using two inches Class B asphalt concrete pavement (when available) or two inches medium-curing (MC-250) liquid asphalt (cold mix), two inches asphalt treated base (ATB), or steel plates.

ATB used for temporary restoration may be placed directly into the trench, bladed and rolled. After rolling, the trench must be filled flush with asphalt concrete pavement to provide a smooth riding surface. Prior to beginning street trenching work, the contractor will ensure that all necessary material for temporary patching is stockpiled at the project site, both for completing and maintaining the patch.

The contractor will maintain all temporary patches until such time as the permanent pavement patch is in place. Patches not properly maintained by the contractor will be repaired by the city at the developer’s, contractor’s and/or private utility’s expense.

P. Pavement Restoration. Trench cuts in roadways greatly degrade the condition of the pavement, as well as reduce its design life. The most significant damage can be seen in newer pavements. Pavement restoration should result in the pavement being as good as, or better than, the pre-trench cut condition. This can be achieved by the prevention of trench cuts, thorough utility coordination, and high-quality pavement restoration.

1. Trench Cuts in New Pavements. Trench cuts are not permitted in pavements that have been constructed or rehabilitated within five years. “Rehabilitation” includes all surface treatments such as chip seal, slurry seal, and asphalt overlay.

If there is no other option but to cut into new pavement, prior approval will be obtained from the director of public works. Pavement must then be restored in accordance with the standards of subsection (P)(3) of this section.

2. Transverse utility crossings must be bored or completed by another trenchless method. Bore pits must be restored in accordance with the standards of subsection (P)(3) of this section.

3. Pavement Restoration Requirements. Trench cuts, bore holes, and miscellaneous pavement repairs will be made in accordance with Standard Drawings 2-5 and 2-6 at the end of this chapter. Pavement will be restored across the entire lane. In addition, the patch will be made perpendicular to the closest affected road edge with a single, straight, continuous cut along the entire width of the required restoration. Minimum restoration width is five feet.

4. Lane Width Restoration Requirements. For longitudinal utility trench cuts in pavements over five years old, a minimum two-inch overlay or full-depth pavement reconstruction is required for the following widths:

a. One-lane overlay or reconstruction – When trench cut or patch is within one travel lane.

b. Two-lane overlay or reconstruction – When trench cut or patch is within two travel lanes.

c. Additional overlay or reconstruction – When the remaining pavement area to the edge of existing pavement on either side is less than one travel lane. No longitudinal joints will be allowed in the wheel path.

All trench and pavement cuts will be made uniformly by wheel or saw cutting. The cuts will be a minimum of one foot outside the trench width. If the edge of the trench line degrades, ravels or is nonuniform, additional saw cutting will be required prior to final patch or paving.

All trenching will be backfilled with crushed surfacing materials conforming to Section 4-04 of the most recent edition of WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications. The subgrade will be compacted to 95 percent maximum density, as described in Section 2-03 of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications.

All granular backfill material will conform to Section 9-03.19 of the current edition of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications.

If the existing material is determined by the city to be suitable for backfill, the contractor may use the native material except that the top eight inches of trench will be two and one-half inch minus ballast. All trench backfill materials will be compacted to 95 percent density.

When the trench width is 18 inches or less and is within the travel way, the trench will be backfilled with control density fill (CDF) Class B, as defined by the Washington Aggregates and Concrete Association. The aggregate will be three-eighths-inch minus. CDF may be required in wider trenches within the travel way if site conditions dictate.

Backfill placement and compaction will be performed in six-inch lifts.

Replacement of the asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete will conform to the most current edition of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications.

5. Tack Coat. Tack will be applied to the existing pavement along the edge of cut and will be emulsified asphalt grade CSS-1 as specified in the most recent edition of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications. Tack coat will be applied as identified in Section 5-04 of the most recent WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications.

6. Asphalt Concrete Class B. Asphalt concrete Class B will be placed on the prepared surface by an approved paving machine and will be in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 5-04 of the most recent edition of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications, except that longitudinal joints between successive layers of asphalt concrete will be displaced laterally a minimum of 12 inches, unless otherwise approved by the director of public works. Fine and coarse aggregate will be in accordance with Section 9‑03.8 of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications. Asphalt concrete over two inches thick will be placed in equal lifts not to exceed two inches each.

The preferred means of connection to existing asphalt at the centerline, lane edges, and overlay ends is through grinding. Grinds can be a few inches off centerline to avoid existing stripping. Feathering may be used when grinding is not feasible, with the approval of the director of public works. The affected surfaces within the trenching area will be feathered and shimmed to an extent that provides a smooth-riding connection and expeditious drainage flow for the newly paved surface.

Surface smoothness will be per Section 5-04 of the most recent edition of WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications. The paving will be corrected by removal and repaving of the trench only.

Asphalt concrete pavement for wearing course will not be placed on any travel way between October 15th and April 1st without written approval of the director of public works.

Asphalt for prime coat will not be applied when the temperature is lower than 50 degrees Fahrenheit without written approval of the director of public works.

7. Final Patch. The final patch will be completed as soon as possible but no later than 30 calendar days after the trench is first opened. Time extensions due to inclement weather or other adverse conditions will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, any delays must have prior approval of the director of public works.

8. Staking. All surveying and staking will be performed by an engineering or surveying firm licensed by the state of Washington and capable of performing such work.

A preconstruction meeting will be held with the public works department and the engineering division prior to commencing staking. All construction staking will be inspected by city inspectors prior to construction.

The minimum staking of curb, gutter and sidewalk will be as follows:

a. Stake centerline alignment every 25 feet (50 feet in tangent sections) with cuts and/or fills to subgrade.

b. Stake top of ballast and top of crushed surfacing at centerline and edge of pavement every 25 feet.

c. Stake top back of curb at a consistent offset for vertical and horizontal alignment every 25 feet (50 feet in tangent sections).

d. Staking will be maintained throughout construction.

9. Testing. Testing will be required at the developer’s or contractor’s expense. The developer or contractor is responsible to order all required testing. The testing lab will be approved by the public works department or designated consultant prior to the commencement of any testing. Testing will be done on all materials and construction as specified in the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications and with the frequency as specified herein.

In addition, the public works department and the engineering division will be notified before each phase of street construction commences (i.e., staking, grading, subgrade, ballast, base, top course, and surfacing). A minimum of two business days’ advance notice is required before the start of each phase. All test results and documentation will be submitted to the public works department and the engineering division prior to final approval of the project.

Q. Traffic-Calming Devices. Traffic calming is used in Chehalis neighborhoods to improve residential livability by reducing the speed and impact of vehicular traffic in localized areas. This is accomplished through the incorporation of traffic-calming devices on local residential streets. Traffic-calming measures will be considered on a site-specific basis.

A petition signed by at least 67 percent of the affected property owners may be required prior to the consideration of traffic-calming devices in an existing neighborhood. Additional information along with a traffic analysis and engineering calculations may also be required by the director of public works prior to the consideration of traffic-calming devices in an existing neighborhood. In new developments, traffic-calming devices may be required by the city or may be requested by developers if these standards are met.

1. Speed berms have been approved for installation as a traffic-calming device when approved by the director of public works and installed in accordance with Standard Drawing 2‑25.

Speed berms will be placed 400 to 600 feet apart with a minimum spacing of one per block.

Pavement marking design and materials will conform to the most current edition of the MUTCD.

2. Additional Measures. Other traffic-calming measures will be considered on a site-specific basis and must be approved in writing by the director of public works. [Ord. 819B §§ 13, 19, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (2B), 2005.]


12.04.290 Sidewalks, curbs and gutters.

A. General. Sidewalks are to be installed as designated in Article II of this chapter. Sidewalks are to be constructed along all streets that abut the property. Curbs and gutters will also be included with such sidewalk construction, unless otherwise authorized by the director of public works. Sidewalks will be designed to accommodate any necessary traffic control signs while still providing a minimum five-foot unobstructed walking area.

Typical sidewalk, curb, and gutter location will be at the edge of proposed or existing pavement. The sidewalk will be aligned in a relatively straight configuration and make smooth transitions around curves and corners. Alternate locations may be proposed, including the incorporation of parking and planting strips. The public works department or designated consultant may approve such alternative after he determines that strict compliance with the standards is impractical or unreasonable in the circumstance.

The owner of the property that abuts a sidewalk is responsible for all repair, maintenance, and upkeep of said sidewalk. The city is not liable for any damage or injuries caused by a sidewalk in need of repair (see CMC 12.40.020).

B. Design Standards. Plans for construction of sidewalks, curbs and gutters are to be submitted as part of the street plans when applicable.

The city has set forth minimum standards that must be met in the design and construction of sidewalks, curbs and gutters. A traffic impact analysis may indicate that other design configurations would be preferable for a given project. Such alternatives may be required by the city if the public works department or designated consultant determines that strict compliance with the standards is impractical or unreasonable in the circumstance.

Sidewalks must also meet all ADA requirements including Truncated Domes; see Standard Drawing No. 2-27.

1. Sidewalks will be constructed of commercial concrete four inches thick except in a driveway section, at which point the concrete thickness must meet driveway standards. The minimum width of sidewalk will be five feet. When the sidewalk, curb and gutter are contiguous, the width of the sidewalk will be measured from the back of the curb and gutter to the back of the sidewalk. In commercial areas, sidewalks may be required to extend from the curb to the property line.

2. Arterial Streets. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters will be required on both sides of arterial streets interior to the development. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters will also be required on the development side of arterial streets abutting the exterior of said development.

3. Local Access Streets. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters will be required on both sides of local access streets interior to the development. Sidewalks, curbs and gutters will also be required on the development side of local access streets abutting the exterior of said development including cul-de-sacs.

4. Design and Construction. The design and construction of all sidewalks, curbs, gutters and walkways will meet the following minimum standards:

a. The width of sidewalks will be as shown in the street design drawings. Design of all sidewalks will provide for a gradual rather than an abrupt transition between sidewalks of different widths or alignments.

b. Form and subgrade inspection by a city inspector is required before the sidewalk is poured.

c. Monolithic pour of curb, gutter and sidewalk will not be allowed without specific approval from the director of public works.

5. Driveways. See CMC 12.04.280(L).

6. Curbs and Gutters. Cement concrete curbs and gutters will be used for all street edges unless otherwise approved by the public works director. All curbs and gutters will be constructed in accordance with Standard Drawing 2-7.

7. The face or top of all new curbs will be embossed one-fourth inch into the cement to denote the location of water and sewer service crossings. Water services will be marked with a “W” and side sewers will be marked with an “S.” The markings will be at least three inches in height and clearly legible.

8. Access Ramps. Sidewalks will be constructed to provide for access ramps in accordance with state law. Access ramps will be constructed of commercial concrete. Form and subgrade inspection by a city inspector is required before the access ramp is poured.

C. Staking. All surveying and staking will be performed by an engineering or surveying firm licensed by the state of Washington and capable of performing such work.

A preconstruction meeting will be held with the public works department and the engineering division prior to commencing staking. All construction staking will be inspected by the public works department prior to construction.

The minimum staking of curb, gutter and sidewalk will be as follows: stake top back of curb at a consistent offset for vertical and horizontal alignment every 25 feet (50 feet in tangent sections).

D. Testing. Testing will be required at the developer’s or contractor’s expense on all materials and construction as specified in the most recent edition of WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications.

At a minimum, one slump test and two test cylinders will be taken once per day. All other testing frequencies will be as specified in the testing and sampling frequency guide table in CMC 12.04.280(P)(9). In addition, the city will be notified before each phase of sidewalk, curb and gutter construction commences. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (2C), 2005.]


12.04.300 Illumination.

A. General. New commercial or residential subdivisions, short plats or property development along the locations designated in Article II of this chapter will provide streetlights in accordance with these standards for such improvements of the city and they will be owned and operated by the city.

B. Design Standards. A street lighting plan submitted by the applicant and approved by the director of public works or designated consultant will be required for all streetlight installations. Type of installation will be as set forth in the most recent edition of WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications, the illumination standards table in this section, and as directed by the city.

All public streetlight designs will be prepared by an engineering firm, licensed by the state of Washington, and capable of performing such work. All developments will submit the lighting plan on a separate plan sheet. After the system is completed and approved, a set of as-built mylars will be submitted to the city as a permanent record.

Streetlights will be located in accordance with the design criteria contained herein, and as approved by the director of public works or designated consultant. In addition, intersections will be illuminated to one and one-half times the highest foot-candle requirement of the streets surrounding the intersection. Exception: in residential and intermediate classes, local and collector streets intersecting other local and collector streets will not be subject to the one and one-half times illumination factor, provided a luminaire is placed at the intersection. Energy-efficient fixtures will be incorporated into the streetlight system whenever practical. Poles will be opposite across the roadway or on one side of the roadway.

For the purposes of this section, area classes are determined by zoning as follows:

	Commercial

The pole will also be equipped with a dedicated 120V, 20 AMP circuit with a recessed weatherproof GFI power receptacle, that meets all applicable guidelines and standards. The receptacle will be located 13 feet above the base of the pole.

All luminaires will be flat lens, medium cut off, IES Type II distribution and will comply with all standards as established by Public Utility District No. 1 of Lewis County. Unless otherwise required by PUD No. 1, luminaires will be: 200 watt, catalog No. GEMDCL2OSA11FMC31. Higher wattage luminaires may be considered if necessary to achieve lighting requirements.

All streetlight electrical installations including wiring conduits and power connections will be located underground.

New street lighting will be designed and installed in such a way as to blend with any utility pole-mounted lighting that may exist along the frontage of adjacent properties, but also to accommodate future integration of conforming streetlights along the roadway. To this end, when streetlight(s) are required along a property, conduit(s) and junction box(es) will be installed along the entire frontage, as appropriate, to allow for the interconnection of future streetlight installations. This requirement may be waived with approval of the director of public works, based on the site-specific conditions of the property in question.

Alternate streetlight designs may be allowed or required by the city to accommodate the unique characteristics of a particular street or neighborhood. For example, special lighting may be deemed appropriate along a street that is part of a designated historic district. The use of any alternate street lighting must be approved in writing by the director of public works or designated consultant.

The general notes that follow will be included on any plans dealing with streetlight design, in addition to all other applicable requirements.

1. Street Type: Major Arterial, Minor Arterial, Bus Routes and Truck Routes. A pre-cast concrete monument with cast iron monument case and cover installed per these standards is required.

2. Street Type: Commercial Collector, Neighborhood Collector, and Local Access. A cast-in-place concrete surface monument with sufficient ferrous metal embedded to allow for detection by a magnetic detection device per these standards is required. Cap will be “Berntsen RB Series” or brass plug marker.

3. Required Monument Locations.

a. All intersections;

b. At the PC and PTs of all horizontal curves;

c. At PI of all horizontal curves of streets where the PI lies within the limits of the traveled roadway;

d. At all corners, control points and angle points around the perimeter of subdivisions as determined by the city;

e. At all section corners, quarter corners, and sixteenth corners within the right-of-way.

f. The monument case will be installed after the final course of surfacing has been placed.

F. Bus Pullouts and Shelters.

1. General. Nothing in these standards will preclude the local transit provider from conducting on-street drop-offs and pickups. The intent of these provisions is to provide general guidelines for the installation of new bus facilities and ensure their proper design and integration with the city’s transportation network. They must also meet the needs of the transit provider and the community at large.

When bus pullouts and/or shelters are deemed necessary in accordance with the provisions provided herein, the installation of these facilities will be the responsibility of the developer or builder.

2. Frequency and Spacing for Public Transit Stops. The city and local transit provider will consider the following general guidelines to determine frequency and spacing of improved stops on any given public transit route:

a. When determining the physical location of a bus pullout and/or shelter, consideration will be given to vehicle and pedestrian safety, impacts to adjacent property owners, and operational efficiency of the transit service.

b. Bus pullouts can be initially located at an average of four to six stops per route-mile along local residential segments of a route.

c. Additional stops may be added if warranted, but will not exceed the basic stop spacing guidelines of eight to 10 stops per mile and no two stops may be located within 600 feet of one another.

d. Site designs for businesses, residential subdivisions, and multifamily developments along transit routes will accommodate transit use. This may include the location of a building entrance near a transit stop, pedestrian walkways, sheltered or unsheltered transit stops, and/or a bus pullout.

3. Placement and Design of School Bus Stops. The city and the Chehalis School District will use the following criteria to jointly determine the placement and design of school bus stops:

a. A school bus stop will be required for each new residential subdivision or apartment complex where school children are to be boarding or disembarking, unless it is determined that adjacent facilities already exist for the site.

b. Location of school bus stops will be designed with safety as a paramount concern. Major arterials with high traffic counts should be avoided when possible and only used when bus pullouts are available and significant protection is provided for children.

c. School bus stops will be designed to complement the residential environment and provide convenient location and access for neighborhood children including sidewalk access.

d. Every effort will be made to make school bus stops and sidewalk access to school bus stops a safe and friendly pedestrian environment.

e. The local transit provider and the Chehalis School District should make every effort to coordinate the location of bus stops. However, separate bus facilities may be necessary for both service providers.

4. Physical Location Requirements. The physical location of all bus pullouts will be primarily determined by the following considerations: maximizing safety, operational efficiency, and minimizing impacts to adjacent property. Bus pullouts may be required on all arterial and commercial collector roads for safe bus berthing and to minimize impacts of bus stops on traffic flow. Additionally, bus pullouts may be required on local access roads if road geometry requires, such as determined by the public works department. Maintaining adequate separation between driveways/intersections and bus pullouts can increase the safety and efficiency of both the roadway and the transit service. When locating a bus pullout in reference to existing driveways or a driveway in reference to an existing bus pullout, the following guidelines will be taken into consideration:

a. On local roads, bus pullouts will be located a minimum of 55 feet (75 feet preferred) from any driveway as measured from the closest driveway edge to the pullout loading area. On arterial roadways, bus pullouts will be located in accordance with the site distance requirements noted in CMC 12.04.280(M). These location requirements will serve as a general guide for bus pullout installations.

Alternative distances may be considered if sufficient engineering data is provided demonstrating that adequate site distance is maintained, pedestrian safety is protected and vehicular traffic is not hindered. The final determination for a bus pullout location must be approved by the director of public works.

b. Bus pullouts should not be located where the transit vehicle will block sight distance from a driveway or intersection.

c. Driveways should not be located within the taper of the pullout.

5. Transit and School Bus Stop Signage. All designated public transit and Chehalis School District bus stops will be identified in some fashion. This may include pavement marking and bus stop signs. Contact the local transit provider for details on their sites.

6. Shelters. Passenger shelters may be required at bus pullouts and transfer centers. Shelters may also be required at bus stops as determined by the local transit provider and the public works department.

Passenger shelters for public transit sites and Chehalis School District sites will be transparent for passenger visibility and safety, provide protection from the elements, and be reasonably vandalism-resistant for easy maintenance.

7. Shelter Installations. When bus shelters are required, they will be installed in the following manner:

a. The developer/builder will provide a concrete pad approximately 12 by 10 feet and six inches thick. The pad will extend in from the curb or edge of the pavement at a specific location designated by the city. The pad will be constructed in accordance with the design standards for sidewalks as noted in CMC 12.04.290.

b. Upon completion of the pad, the local transit provider will construct the shelter. The developer/builder will be responsible for all appropriate costs associated with the shelter installation. A final certificate of occupancy will not be issued until all shelter costs have been reimbursed to the transit provider.

8. Design Standards. A pedestrian-friendly environment will be designed into all bus stop locations and surrounding service area to make it user-friendly and safe. The following criteria will be applied to bus stop facilities for new developments:

a. Provide paved walkways with a hard all-weather surface linking various sections of subdivisions and developments to peripheral streets with bus stops.

b. Provide access ramps and other facilities consistent with barrier-free design standards along walkways leading to bus stops.

c. Separate roads and parking areas from pedestrian pathways by grade separations, landscaping, and other devices. A minimum four- to six-foot planting strip will be provided to buffer sidewalks or walkways from streets and parking areas around bus stops and shelters.

d. Provide pedestrian-friendly features such as lighting, signs, and trash receptacles as warranted by anticipated use.

e. New development street systems should be designed to minimize pedestrian travel to bus stops.

G. Mailboxes. During construction, existing mailboxes will be accessible for the delivery of mail or, if necessary, moved to a temporary location. Temporary relocations will be coordinated with the U.S. Postal Service. The mailboxes will be reinstalled at the original location or, if construction has made it impossible, to a location as outlined below and approved by the U.S. Postal Service.

Location:

1. Bottom or base of box will be 36 to 42 inches above the road surface.

2. Front of mailbox will be 18 inches behind vertical curb face or outside edge of shoulder.

3. New Developments. Clustered mailboxes are required (contact the U.S. Postal Service for details). Refer to Standard Drawing 2-18.

4. Mailboxes will be set on posts strong enough to give firm support, not to exceed four-by-four-inch wood or one-and-one-half-inch-diameter pipe, or a material and design with comparable breakaway characteristics.

H. Guard Rails. For purposes of design and location, all guard rails along roadways will conform to the criteria of the Department of Transportation Design Manual, as may be amended or revised.

I. Retaining Walls.

1. General. Rock walls may be used for erosion protection of cut or fill embankments up to a maximum height of eight feet in stable soil conditions that will result in no significant foundation settlement or outward thrust upon the walls. For heights over six feet or when soil is unstable, structural wall of acceptable design stamped by a licensed structural engineer will be used.

In the absence of such a rock wall design, walls having heights over six feet or walls constructed in conditions where soil is unstable are required to be a preengineered structural wall having a design approved by the public works department (or the community development director if outside the right-of-way). Structural walls will be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington and qualified in retaining wall design. Structural walls require issuance of a building permit from the community development department prior to construction.

Any rock wall over 30 inches high in a fill section will require the design of a geotechnical engineer. The geotechnical engineer will continuously inspect the installation of the wall as it progresses and submit inspection reports, including compaction test results and photographs taken during construction, documenting the techniques used and the degree of conformance to the geotechnical engineer’s design.

Terraced walls will be reviewed and approved on a site-specific basis. Use of terraced walls in the right-of-way must be approved by the public works department or designated consultant.

2. Material. The rock material will be as rectangular as possible. No stone will be used which does not extend through the wall. The rock material will be hard, sound, durable and free from weathered portions, seams, cracks and other defects. The rock density will be a minimum of 170 pounds per cubic foot.

3. Foundation. The rock wall will be started by excavating a trench with a depth below subgrade of one-half the base course or one foot, whichever is greater.

4. Rock Placement. Rock selection and placement will be such that there will be minimum voids and, in the exposed face, no open voids over six inches across in any direction. The final course will have a continuous appearance and will be placed to minimize erosion of the backfill material. The larger rocks will be stable and have a stable appearance. The rocks will be placed in a manner such that the longitudinal axis of the rock will be at right angles or perpendicular to the rockery face. The rocks will have all inclining faces sloping to the back of the rockery. Each course of rocks will be seated as tightly and evenly as possible on the course beneath. After setting each course of rock, all voids between the rocks will be chinked on the back with quarry rock to eliminate any void sufficient to pass a two-inch square probe.

5. Backfill. The wall backfill will consist of one-and-one-half-inch washed rock or as specified by a licensed engineer. This material will be placed to a 12-inch minimum thickness between the entire wall and the cut or fill material. The backfill material will be placed in lifts to an elevation approximately six inches below the top of each course of rocks as they are placed, until the uppermost course is placed. Any backfill material on the bearing surface of one rock course will be removed before setting the next course.

6. Drainage. Perforated drainage pipe and filter fabric will be installed as per Standard Drawing 2-23. This pipe requirement may be waived by the director of public works if the developer is able to demonstrate, to the city’s satisfaction, that no subsurface water problems exist.

J. Street Trees. In order for developers or property owners to plant trees, shrubbery or other vegetation that may attain a height of more than 30 inches within the right-of-way, they must first apply for and obtain a right-of-way permit from the city. The application must include information on the type of tree or plant and the proposed location placement.

Certain varieties of trees are prohibited from being planted within a city right-of-way. Such trees are excluded from the right-of-way to protect utilities and infrastructure or to minimize visual obstructions and interference. Trees not to be planted within a city right-of-way specifically include the following:

Alder; apple (fruiting); ash, mountain; birch, white; cherry (fruiting); chestnut; cottonwood; elm, American; hawthorne; London plane; maple, big leaf; maple, Oregon; maple, silver; oak, pine; pagoda; pear (fruiting); plum (fruiting); poplar; sycamore; walnut; willow; and any other species of tree with a propensity to produce large or extensive root systems that may interfere with or damage underground utilities or public infrastructure including streets, curbing, and sidewalks.

Also prohibited from being planted within the right-of-way are any other species of plants or trees that will create an obstruction or potential obstruction to traffic, pedestrian visibility or safe public use of the right-of-way.

K. Parking Lots. A right-of-way permit is required prior to surfacing a nonsurfaced designated parking area that will access a public right-of-way.

Storm water retention will be provided and will follow the criteria as set forth in the storm water management plan and as addressed in Article IV of this chapter.

Parking lot circulation and signing needs will be met on site. The public right-of-way will not be utilized as part of a one-way parking lot flow.

All requirements for construction of parking lots will be determined through the development plan review process, including capacity and configuration. Parking lot ingress and egress will be evaluated to determine traffic controls necessary to ensure vehicle safety to and from the public right-of-way.

Parking lot surfacing materials must meet the requirements for a permanent all-weather surface. Asphalt concrete pavement and cement concrete pavement satisfy this requirement and are approved materials. Gravel surfaces are not acceptable or an approved surface material type. Combination grass/paving systems are approved surface material types; however, their use requires submittal of an overall parking lot paving plan showing the limits of the grass/paving systems and a description of how the systems will be irrigated and maintained. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 810B § 6, 2006; Ord. 785B § 14 (2F), 2005.]


12.04.330 Traffic impact analysis.

A. General. A traffic impact analysis (TIA) is a specialized study of the impacts that a specific type and size of development will have on the surrounding transportation system. The TIA is an integral part of the development review process. It is specifically concerned with the generation, distribution, and assignment of traffic to and from a new development or a redevelopment. “New development” is defined as any site action involving SEPA. This may include previous development on a site with consideration to cumulative impacts for the purpose of making a SEPA threshold decision. Redevelopment will include expanded or increased development, or use or occupancy of a building or site that has been dormant for a period of more than five years.

For the purposes of this document, the term “proposed project” will be used to refer to both new development and redevelopment.

These guidelines have been prepared to establish the requirements for a TIA. If a TIA is required for a project, the public works department or designated consultant will be the city contact for matters relating to the TIA. The public works department or designated consultant will also be responsible for reviewing and accepting TIAs as well as approving measures to mitigate impacts.

B. When Required.

1. The need for a TIA will be based on the size of the proposed development, existing street and intersection conditions, traffic volumes, accident history, community concerns, and other pertinent factors associated with the proposed project.

2. A TIA will be required if a proposed development meets one or more of the following conditions:

a. The proposed project generates more than 10 vehicles in the peak direction of the peak hour on the adjacent streets and intersections. This includes the summation of all turning movements that affect the peak direction of traffic.

b. The proposed project generates more than 25 percent of the site-generated peak hour traffic through a signalized intersection or “critical” movement at a nonsignalized intersection.

c. The proposed project is within an existing or proposed transportation benefit area. This may include transportation benefit districts (TBD), local improvement districts (LID), or local/state transportation improvement areas programmed for development reimbursements.

d. The proposed project may potentially affect the implementation of the street system outlined in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan, the six-year transportation improvement program, or any other documented transportation project.

e. If the original TIA was prepared more than two years before the proposed project completion date.

f. The increase in traffic volume as measured by ADT, peak hour, or peak hour of the “critical” movement is more than 10 percent.

3. Even if it is determined that a TIA is not required, the director of public works or designated consultant may require the developer to have a trip generation study (TGS) conducted. TGSs will be used to forecast project-generated traffic for an established future horizon.

C. Qualifications for Preparing TIA Documents. The TIA will be prepared by an engineer licensed in the state of Washington and with special training and demonstrated experience in traffic engineering. The applicant will provide the public works department or designated consultant with the credentials of the individual(s) selected to perform the TIA for approval prior to initiating the analysis.

D. References. In conducting TIAs and TGSs, the method for determining capacity will be as described in the most recent version of the “Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity Manual,” and the method for determining project-generated traffic volumes will be as forecasted using the most recent edition of “Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual.”

E. Scope of Work. The level of detail and scope of work of a TIA may vary with the size, complexity, and location of the proposed project. A TIA will be a thorough review of the immediate and long-range effects of the proposed project on the city’s transportation system. The analysis will include the following elements, as applicable:

1. Provide a reduced copy of the site plan, showing the type of development, street system, right-of-way limits, access points, and other features significant to the city’s transportation system. The site plan will also include pertinent off-site information such as locations of adjacent intersections and driveways, land-use descriptions, and other features of significance.

2. Provide a vicinity map of the project area showing the transportation system to be impacted by the development.

3. Discuss specific development characteristics such as the size and type of development proposed (single-family, multifamily, retail, industrial, etc.), internal street network, parking spaces provided, zoning, and other pertinent factors attributable to the proposed project.

4. Discuss project completion and occupancy schedule for the proposed project. Identify horizon year(s) for traffic analysis purposes.

F. Existing Conditions.

1. Discuss street characteristics including functional classification, bicycle path corridors and traffic control at study intersections, number of traveled lanes, lane width, and shoulder treatment. A figure should be used to illustrate existing transportation facilities. Refer to the Sample TIA Figure in this section.

2. Identify safety and access problems including discussions on accident history, sight distance restrictions, traffic control, and pedestrian conflicts.

3. Utilize all available traffic data from the city of Chehalis and surrounding jurisdictions, if applicable. If data is unavailable, the individual or firm preparing the TIA will collect the necessary data to supplement the discussions and analysis in the TIA.

4. Conduct manual peak hour turning movement counts at study intersections if traffic volume data is more than two years old. A copy of the reduced data will be included with the TIA. The peak hour(s) to be counted and analyzed will be the time period(s) when the combination of proposed project traffic and existing traffic is highest. A study intersection is any arterial/collector intersection impacted by 10 or more proposed project trips during the peak hour(s) analyzed by the TIA. The public works department or designated consultant may require that the study also include additional intersections or areas.

5. A figure will be prepared showing existing average daily traffic (ADT) and peak hour traffic volumes on the adjacent streets and intersections in the study area. Complete turning movement volumes will be diagrammed or illustrated and included in the TIA. The figure will represent the existing traffic volumes for analysis purposes. Refer to the Sample TIA Figure in this section.

G. Development Traffic.

1. This element of the TIA will identify the limits of the study area. The study area will include all pertinent intersections and streets impacted by development traffic.

2. The threshold requirement of development traffic of 10 vehicles in the peak direction of the peak hour on the adjacent streets and intersections will apply. The threshold requirement of the development generating 25 percent or more of site traffic through a signalized intersection or “critical” movements at a nonsignalized intersection will also apply. Each arterial/collector intersection and street impacted as described will be included in the study area for analysis purposes.

3. A figure illustrating the proposed trip distribution for the proposed project will be included in the TIA. The TGS will be displayed in a tabular format on the figure with peak hour traffic volumes assigned to the study area in accordance with the trip distribution.

a. Trip Generation. Site-generated traffic of proposed projects will be estimated using the latest edition of the “Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual.” Variations of trip rates will require the approval of the public works department or designated consultant. Trip rate equations will be used for all land use categories where applicable. Average trip rates will be allowed for those land uses without trip rate equations. Site traffic will be generated for daily a.m. and p.m. peak hour periods. A “pass-by” traffic volume discount for commercial centers will not exceed 25 percent unless approved by the public works department or designated consultant.

b. Trip Distribution. Trip distribution methodology will be clearly defined and discussed in detail in the TIA. For large development projects, the public works director may require a regional trip distribution map. The TIA will identify other transportation modes that may be applicable, such as transit use, bicycle and pedestrian facilities.

H. Future Traffic.

1. Future Traffic Conditions Not Including Site Traffic. Future traffic volumes will be estimated using information from existing transportation forecasts or models, other planned or programmed “on-line” development, and/or transportation projects, or by applying an annual growth rate to the existing traffic volumes as defined in the Chehalis comprehensive plan. The future traffic volumes will be representative of the horizon year(s) for project development. Forecasted nonproject traffic will be added to existing traffic and illustrated in a figure.

2. Future Traffic Conditions Including Site Traffic. The site-generated traffic will be assigned to the street network in the study area based on the approved trip distribution. The site traffic will be combined with forecasted traffic volumes, not including site traffic, to show the total traffic conditions estimated at development completion and at the future horizon year. A figure will be required showing daily and peak period turning movement volumes for each traffic study intersection. Refer to the Sample TIA Figure in this section. In addition, a figure will be prepared showing future traffic conditions, not including site traffic volumes, with site-generated traffic added to the street network.

Unless the city specifically authorizes another future horizon year for a development, the initial target year for determining future traffic will be five years after the development has been occupied or in full operation for 12 months.

I. Traffic Operations.

1. A level of service (LOS) analysis will be conducted for each screen line in the study area. The screen lines and level of service information will be developed in conjunction with the Chehalis comprehensive plan. The methodology and procedures for conducting the capacity analysis will follow the guidelines specified in the most recent version of the “Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity Manual.” The LOS for each screen line will include the following conditions:

a. Existing peak hour traffic volumes;

b. Future traffic volumes not including site traffic;

c. Future traffic volumes including site traffic.

2. LOS results for each traffic volume scenario will be summarized in a single table. The LOS table will include results for a.m. and p.m. peak periods, if applicable. The table will show LOS conditions with corresponding vehicle delays for signalized intersections and reserve capacity or delay for the “critical” movements at nonsignalized intersections. For signalized intersections, the LOS conditions and average vehicle delay will be provided for each approach and the intersection as a whole, in an appendix that contains all LOS calculation sheets.

3. The LOS analyses for existing signalized intersections will include existing phasing, timing, splits and cycle lengths in the analysis as observed and measured during the peak hour traffic periods.

4. If the proposed project is scheduled for completion in phases, the TIA will conduct a LOS analysis for each separate development phase. The incremental increases in site traffic from each phase will be included in the LOS analysis for each proceeding year of development completion. A figure will be required for each horizon year of phased development.

5. If the proposed project impacts a coordinated traffic signal control system currently in operation, the TIA will include an operational analysis of the system. Timing plan and proposed modifications to the coordination system will also be required. For nonsignalized intersections, the “Highway Capacity Manual” methodology will be used.

6. The computer software package(s) used for capacity analysis applications will be approved by the public works department or designated consultant. The public works department or designated consultant may require that a copy of the computer worksheets, along with a three-and-one-half-inch floppy disk of each capacity analysis, be submitted concurrently with the TIA to the public works department.

J. Mitigation.

1. The TIA will include a proposed mitigation plan. The mitigation may be either the construction of necessary transportation improvements or contributions to the city for the proposed project’s fair share cost of identified future transportation improvements, as identified in the city’s comprehensive plan. Levels of service “E” and “F” will be used as the threshold for determining appropriate mitigating measures on roadways and intersections in the study area. Mitigating measures will be required to the extent that the transportation facilities operate at a LOS “C” (LOS-C) condition or better upon completion of the development.

2. The following guidelines will be used to determine appropriate mitigating measures of traffic impacts generated by proposed projects:

a. The cost for the mitigation will be entirely borne by the proposed project. However, in the event that more than one development is being proposed within the study area, a latecomers agreement for reimbursement of mitigation costs may be proposed by the project under consideration.

b. City projects involving transportation facilities programmed for improvements, and having an adverse traffic impact, will be mitigated by providing a proportionate share of the local costs for the improvements. This share will be based on the percentage of proposed project traffic generated through the intersection. The percentage will be based on the total projected peak hour traffic volumes for the horizon year of the transportation facility, or as defined by the ordinance establishing the cost-sharing mechanism for off-site street improvements.

c. Nonsignalized intersections that currently operate at less than level of service “C” (LOS-C) will be analyzed for traffic signal and intersection improvements. If three or more traffic signal warrants are satisfied, signal and intersection improvements will be required as a mitigating measure for the proposed project. If at least three signal warrants are not satisfied by the proposed project’s horizon year, the TIA will determine if traffic signal warrants and intersection improvements would be needed within a five-year period after the proposed project’s horizon year. If so, the proposed project would then be required to provide a proportionate share of the cost of future traffic signal and intersection improvements.

3. When an off-site street improvement(s) is not scheduled to be installed in the near future, the city may allow a developer required to share in the costs of such improvement(s) to post a bond in the amount of the developer’s pro rata share of such improvements. Any developer desiring to post a bond with the city in the amount of the pro rata share of improvement costs must submit a request in writing to the director of public works, along with all applicable justification or information supporting the request. The public works director will submit all request(s) to the city council, who will then make a decision at a regularly scheduled council meeting. All decisions made by the council will be considered final.

K. Mitigation Fee Calculation.

1. The formula for calculating a developer’s mitigation fee or proportional share of an off-site street improvement is derived by dividing the project-generated traffic by the future traffic with the project. In order to determine the developer’s pro rata costs of an off-site street improvement, this value is multiplied by the project costs. Mathematically this formula is written as follows:

PGT/FTP x PC = DMF

PGT = Project-generated traffic

FTP = Future traffic with the project

PC = Project cost

DMF = Developer’s mitigation fee

2. Participation Threshold. The city has established a participation threshold of 10 trips per peak hour. The 10 trips per peak hour sets the minimum level at which a developer will be required to participate. As part of the TIA and/or TGS, intersections and traffic locations will be identified when there will be or are 10 or more new peak hour generated trips.

Article IV. Storm Drainage and Erosion Control


12.04.340 Storm water management.

A. General. The standards established by this article are intended to represent the minimum standards for the design and construction of storm drainage facilities.

The city of Chehalis storm water management plan and the most recent version of the “Stormwater Management Manual for the Puget Sound Basin” documents are considered a part of this article as well as the city development engineering standards, except as supplemented herein. The storm water management plan sets forth the minimum drainage and erosion control requirements as supplemented herein.

B. Design Standards. The design of storm drainage and/or retention/detention systems will depend on their type and local site conditions. The design elements of storm drainage systems will conform to these standards and follow current design practice as set forth in the city of Chehalis storm water management plan. Properties will not be developed in such a way as to discharge storm water onto adjacent lots.

The general notes that follow will be included in all plans dealing with storm water conveyance and/or detention.

11.    All storm lines and catchbasins will be high-velocity cleaned and pressure tested in accordance with Divison 7 of the Standard Specifications prior to paving. Hydrant flushing of the lines is not an acceptable cleaning method. Testing of the storm main will include television inspection at the contractor’s expense. The public works department or designated consultant will determine whether the inspection will be performed by the city or by a representative of the contractor under the city’s direction. Testing will take place after all underground utilities are installed and compaction of the roadway subgrade is completed.

12.    Fill placement will not be allowed in any open channel used for storm conveyance without written approval from the public works department or designated consultant.

13.    Contractors and/or property owners are required to channel water when installing or repairing a driveway. Water may be channeled with a berm or a pipe. Storm water must be diverted to city storm mains when possible.

14.    The city must be notified a minimum of two business days in advance of a tap connection to an existing main. A representative from the city must be present at the time of the tap.

15.    Prior to backfill, all mains and appurtenances will be inspected and approved by a city inspector. Approval does constitute final acceptance of the sewer line. The contractor will retain responsibility of repairing all deficiencies and failures revealed during required testing for acceptance and throughout the duration of the warranty. It is the contractor’s responsibility to notify the city in advance of all required inspections. Any main or appurtenance backfilled prior to inspection will be reexcavated for inspection at no cost to the city.

C. Conveyance.

1. Pipe. Storm drainpipe within a public right-of-way or easement will be sized to carry the maximum anticipated runoff from the contributing area. The calculations of anticipated runoff and pipe sizing will be developed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington. The developer will provide the calculations and all associated information to the public works department.

2. The minimum main size will be 12-inch diameter; smaller pipe sizes will be considered on a case-by-case basis as approved by the public works department or designated consultant. Lateral lines may be six-inch diameter. The city may require the installation of a larger main if it is determined that a larger size is needed to serve adjacent areas or for future service. The installation of a larger main may allow the developer to seek partial reimbursement through a latecomers agreement (see Article II of this chapter for details).

3. All pipe used for storm mains will comply with one of the following types:

a. Plain concrete pipe conforming to the requirements of AASHTO M 86, Class 2.

b. Reinforced concrete pipe conforming to the requirements of AASHTO M 170.

c. PVC pipe conforming to ASTM D3034 SDR 35 or ASTM F794 or ASTM F679 Type 1 with joints and gaskets conforming to ASTM D3212 and ASTM F477.

d. Ductile iron pipe conforming to the requirements of AWWA C151, thickness class as shown on the plans.

e. High-density polyethylene smooth interior pipe conforming to AASHTO M 252 types or AASHTO M 294 Type S, with a gasketed bell and spigot joints.

f. Aluminized steel helical or spiral rib pipe in diameters of 30 inches or greater, with a Manning’s value of 0.020 or less.

4. Channels. Open vegetated channels may be utilized for storm water conveyance when deemed appropriate by the public works department. Open channels located in a public right-of-way will be sized to carry the maximum anticipated runoff from the contributing area without exceeding the confines of the channel. In addition, when the end of the “new” conveyance system is within 20 feet of another piped drainage system, the “new” system will be extended through the open portion to complete the closed system. Extensions to complete closed drainage systems will only be required along the property where the “new” system originates, unless deemed necessary by the public works department or designated consultant.

5. When the flow of an open channel is interrupted by the construction of a driveway, the entire channel across the property will be enclosed with a piped system, unless deemed impractical by the public works department or designated consultant. However, the culvert under the driveway must be installed to accommodate closure of the ditch in the future. The channel enclosure may necessitate the inclusion of manholes and/or catchbasins. (For manholes please refer to CMC 12.04.580(E) and Standard Drawing Nos. 5‑1, 5-2, 5‑12, and 5-14.)

D. Catchbasins. Maximum catchbasin spacing will be 300 feet on all street classifications. No surface water will cross any roadway to private property. Additional manholes and/or catchbasins may be required by the city to accommodate the maintenance needs of the storm system.

E. Staking.

1. All surveying and staking will be performed by an engineer or surveyor licensed by the state of Washington and capable of performing such work. Staking will be maintained throughout the construction operation.

2. A preconstruction meeting will be held with the city prior to commencing staking. The city will inspect all construction staking prior to construction.

3. The minimum staking of storm sewer systems will be as follows:

a. Stake centerline alignment every 25 feet with cuts and/or fills to bottom of trench.

b. Stake location of all catchbasins/manholes and other fixtures for grade and alignment.

c. Stake location, size and depth of retention/detention facility.

d. Stake finished grade of catchbasin/manhole rim elevation and invert elevations of all pipes in catchbasins, manholes, and those that daylight.

F. Trench Excavation. See CMC 12.04.510 for requirements regarding trench excavation.

G. Backfilling. See CMC 12.04.530 for requirements regarding backfilling.

H. Street Patching and Restoration. See CMC 12.04.280(O) and (P) for requirements regarding street patching and trench restoration. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (3A), 2005.]


12.04.350 Erosion control.

A. General.

1. All projects requiring public works department approval, as defined by these standards, will include erosion control plans if any of the following conditions are met:

a. Proposed land disturbance activities that could cause sediment runoff beyond the project limits.

b. A clearing, filling or grading permit is required.

c. The proposed project could possibly impact a nearby stream, wetland, or body of water.

d. When deemed necessary by another permitting authority.

2. Site work will not commence until all erosion control measures have been set in place in accordance with the approved erosion control plans.

3. The contractor/applicant must ensure that all erosion control measures are properly maintained in accordance with standard industry procedures.

4. The general notes that follow will be included on any plans dealing with erosion control.

General Notes (Erosion Control)

1.    Erosion control measures will be in place prior to the beginning of construction. A representative from the city will inspect and approve the erosion control measures prior to the start of construction.

2.    Erosion control measures are not limited to the items on this plan. The contractor is responsible for the installation and maintenance of all erosion measures, as required under the most recent version of the Chehalis storm water management plan. Care will be taken to prevent migration of silt and/or polluted runoff to off-site properties.

3.    The contractor will make regular surveillance of all erosion control measures. In addition, erosion control will be thoroughly inspected after each rainfall event. The contractor will make all necessary repairs, modifications, and additions as necessary to ensure the proper operation of the erosion control measures. The city may require more frequent inspections of erosion control measures by the contractor should site or weather conditions dictate.

4.    During the wet season, November through March, all disturbed soils will be stabilized within 48 hours after land disturbance activities have ceased. Erosion control measures will include, but are not limited to, installation of straw matting, jute matting, straw mulch and/or wood chips, and covering the affected area and spoil piles with plastic sheeting.

5.    The contractor will check all seeded or sodded areas regularly to ensure that the vegetative cover is being adequately established. Areas will be repaired, reseeded, and fertilized as required.

6.    Tracking of soil off site will not be allowed. If any soil is tracked beyond the limits of the site, it will be removed before the end of that working day. To prevent additional tracking, vehicle tires must be swept or washed prior to leaving the project site.

7.    No more than 500 lineal feet (LF) of trench on a downslope of more than five percent will be opened at one time.

8.    Excavated material will be placed on the uphill side of trenches.

9.    Excavated material will not be placed in established drainage ditches under any circumstances.

10.    Trench dewatering devices will be discharged in a manner that will not adversely affect flowing streams, drainage systems, or off-site properties. An established sediment trap will be used as the receiver for all trench dewatering operations.

11.    All disturbed areas will be seeded or sodded upon completion of work. The contractor will be responsible to ensure that complete coverage of the disturbed areas is provided and that growth of vegetation is established. Seed and sod applications will be conducted in accordance with the timelines noted in the most recent edition of the WSDOT Standard Specifications.

12.    All erosion control will remain in place until such time as the site is adequately stabilized. Prior to removal of erosion control measures, the engineering division will be notified for final inspection and approval.

B. Best Management Practices. Erosion control may include the following:

1. Sedimentation Ponds.

a. Sedimentation ponds are utilized to collect runoff generated on a construction site, thereby allowing sediment to be captured before the runoff leaves the site. Sedimentation pond design will include the following considerations:

i. Computation of the sediment storage volume;

ii. Computation of the settling volume;

iii. Computation of the pond surface area (surface area, in square feet = 1,250 x one-year, 24-hour storm rate, in cfs).

b. Minimum pond dimensions are as follows:

i. Two-foot depth for settling;

ii. Three-foot depth for sediment storage;

iii. Three-to-one ratio side slope.

c. The contractor will inspect sedimentation ponds immediately after each rain event to ensure the integrity of the facility. The contractor will also remove the majority of the sediment collected in the ponds whenever the storage volume is exceeded or the settling volume is infringed upon. In addition, prior to the final completion of the project, ponds will be cleaned out in their entirety.

d. The length/width ratio of the pond will be as large as possible. A 5:1 ratio is the preferred minimum, but exceptions may be granted when deemed appropriate by the public works department or designated consultant. The pond will be divided into a series of at least two separate chambers. Perforated pipe risers will be used to convey water between the chambers and at the outlet.

2. Interceptor Channels. Interceptor channels are used to capture runoff generated on a construction site before it can leave the project limits. The channel is often used in combination with a sedimentation pond. The channel is typically grass-lined and runs along the perimeter of the site. The grass must be established prior to the start of construction. Therefore, sod is often used to establish the vegetated surface of the channel. Upon completion of the project, the sod can be removed and reused if the ditch is filled in and restored with a suitable and stable cover material.

3. Sediment Barriers. Sediment barriers are filtering devices that are run along the perimeter of a site to capture sediment while allowing runoff water to continue along its natural path. Silt fencing and hay bales are common examples of sediment barriers.

Regular removal of sediment is required to ensure that the barriers function properly. In addition, the structural integrity of the barriers must be maintained at all times. Barriers will be installed, inspected and repaired in accordance with the details and requirements included in these standards.

4. Stabilized Construction Entrance. A stabilized construction entrance is a rocked access point to a construction site. The entrance reduces material carried from the site onto the public right-of-way.

Construction entrances must be cleared of mud and debris regularly to ensure that materials are not being tracked from the construction site onto the right-of-way and beyond. The contractor is responsible for all required maintenance of entrances.

5. Detention/Retention Facilities. No retention/detention facility will be located in an area that is used to satisfy an open space requirement unless it enhances a recreational amenity. Use of designated open space areas for storm water detention/retention and infiltration must satisfy all conditions of the city of Chehalis for usability, landscape conformity and ease of access. The city will make the final determination whether or not the proposed storm water facilities are compatible with and satisfy the intent of an open space.

The primary purpose of a consolidated open space is to provide usable area for recreation activities, buffer zones, and green belt areas, and must be designed for this intent. Any use of this area for storm water detention/retention must clearly be subordinate to and not detract from open space uses. The usable open space will be predominantly flat and in no case exceed 4:1 where drainage facilities are present. A minimum of 50 percent of the linear slope length will not exceed 7:1.

The public works department or designated consultant will review the use of commercial parking lots for storm water detention on a case-by-case basis. The detention area will be situated away from areas of pedestrian movement. The maximum depth of water in parking lot storage will be limited to 12 inches. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (3B), 2005.]

Article V. Water


12.04.360 General.

Any extension of the Chehalis water system must be approved by the department of public works and conform to the department of health, the city of Chehalis water system plan, and Chehalis police department and fire department requirements.

In designing and planning for any development, it is the developer’s responsibility to determine that adequate water for both domestic use and fire protection is attainable. Proposed plans must show how water will be supplied and whether adequate water pressure and volume will be maintained in case of fire. An analysis of the system may be required if it appears that the system might be inadequate.

Anyone desiring to extend or connect to the city water system must contact the engineering division for a water/sewer/storm water application form. After the completed application is returned to the public works department, along with any other information that may be required or requested, staff will determine the costs to connect to city utilities. Extension of or connection to city water lines outside of the Chehalis urban growth area (UGA) is permitted only when a demonstrated public health risk exists and has been identified in writing by an appropriate health agency.

Prior to the issuance of a water meter for development projects, all public works improvements must be completed and approved, including granting of right-of-way or easements, submission and acceptance of as-built drawings, and all applicable fees must be paid.

Building permits for new construction of single-family subdivisions will not be issued without final approval of the public works director. For commercial projects, building permits may be issued upon completion and acceptance of the required fire protection facilities. A construction bond, in accordance with CMC 12.04.190, will be required for the remaining improvements. A certificate of occupancy will not be issued until final public works approval is given for all improvements. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.01), 2005; Ord. 767B, 2004; Ord. 766B, 2004.]


12.04.370 Design standards.

A. The design of any water extension/connection shall conform to these standards and all other applicable standards. The layout of extensions shall be extended to and through the property frontage to be developed to provide for continuation and/or looping of the existing system. The public works department and/or the engineering division has the authority to apply or necessitate items not covered or mentioned in this article.

6.    All lines will be chlorinated and tested in conformance with the above-referenced specifications (see Note 1).

7.    All pipes and services will be installed with continuous tracer tape placed 12 to 18 inches under the proposed finished subgrade. The marker will be of plastic, nonbiodegradable, metal core, or backing marked “WATER” that can be detected by a standard metal detector. Tape will be Terra Tape “D” or approved equal. In addition to tracer tape, toning wire will be installed over all pipe and services. Toning wire will be UL listed, type UF, 14-gauge solid coated copper wire, taped to the top of the pipe to prevent movement during backfilling and laid loose enough to prevent stretching and damage before being brought up and tied off at the valve operating nut or valve box. If the operating nut is not easily accessible from the ground surface, the copper wire will be tied off at the valve box in such a way that the wire is easily accessible from the ground surface. Two feet of slack will be provided to allow for connection to the locator.

    A one-pound magnesium anode will be buried with the pipe every 1,000 linear feet maximum for cathodic protection of the toning wire. Toning wire splices and connections to anodes will join wires both mechanically and electrically and will employ epoxy resin or heat-shrink tape insulation. Toning wire will be tested prior to acceptance of the pipe system. A written notice from the contractor to the city must be received two business days prior to when testing is required.

8.    The contractor will provide traffic control plan(s) as required in accordance with MUTCD.

9.    All water mains will be staked for grades and alignment by an engineering or surveying firm capable of performing such work. Staking will be maintained throughout construction.

10.    All service line and water valve locations will be marked on the face of the adjacent curb with a “W” or “WV” embossed one-fourth inch into the concrete.

11.    All water system connections serving buildings or properties with domestic potable water, fire sprinkler or irrigation systems will comply with the minimum backflow prevention requirements established by the Department of Health (DOH) and the city of Chehalis cross-connection control program.

12.    Call Utilities Underground Location Center at 1-800-424-5555 a minimum of two business days prior to any excavations.

13.    The city will be notified five business days prior to scheduling a water system shutdown. The city’s water division will perform all water system shutdowns. When connections require “field verification,” connection points will be exposed by the contractor and fittings verified by the city two business days prior to the distribution of shutdown notices. Customers involved with or affected by water service interruptions will be notified at least 48 hours in advance. Shutdowns will not be permitted on Fridays, weekends, or holidays without written authorization from the director of public works.

14.    When connecting to an existing water line where a new valve is not to be installed, the existing valve must be pressure tested to these standards by the contractor prior to connection. If an existing valve fails to pass the test, the contractor will make the necessary additional provisions to test the new line prior to connecting to the existing system or will install a new valve. New lines will not be connected to the existing system until all required tests have been passed.

[Ord. 858B § 2, 2010; Ord. 785B § 14 (4.02), 2005.]


12.04.380 Water main.

A. General. Water mains will be sized to provide adequate domestic water plus fire flows at the required residual pressure. Fire flow requirements will be determined by the Chehalis fire department. However, the quantity of water required will in no case be less than 1,000 gpm at 20 psi residual pressure in single-family and/or duplex residential areas, or less than 1,500 gpm at 20 psi residual pressure in multifamily residential areas, commercial areas and/or industrial areas.

The minimum water main size will be six inches in diameter where looped. Dead-end mains will be a minimum of eight inches in diameter. All mains that may be extended or looped must end with an approved flanged gate valve and blind flange. A straddle block will be installed at a point along the last length of pipe preceding the valve, in lieu of a thrust block at the end.

Larger-sized mains may be required in specific areas identified in the Chehalis water system plan. The city may also require the installation of larger mains if determined necessary to meet fire protection needs, domestic requirements and/or for future service needs (see CMC 12.04.130, Latecomers agreements).

B. Piping. All pipe for water mains will have flexible gasketed joints and will comply with the following specifications:

Ductile iron pipe will conform to AWWA C151 Class 52 and will have a cement mortar lining conforming to AWWA C104. All pipes will be joined using nonrestrained joints that will be rubber gaskets, push-on type or mechanical joint, conforming to AWWA C111.

C. Fittings. All fittings will be ductile iron compact fittings conforming to AWWA C153 or AWWA C110 or C111. All fittings will be cement mortar lined conforming to AWWA C104. Plain-end fittings will be ductile iron if mechanical joint retainer glands are installed on the plain ends. All fittings will be connected by flanges or mechanical joints. The city shall require the use of MEGALUG retainers for a water line installation, as necessary.

D. Pipe Installation. All pipe and services will be installed as directed in note 7 of the general notes in CMC 12.04.370.

E. Cover Required. The minimum cover for all water mains from top of pipe to finished grade will be 30 inches for ductile iron pipe unless otherwise approved.

F. Connection to Existing Water Mains. The developer’s engineer will be responsible for determining the scope of work for connection to existing water mains. A minimum of five business days’ advance notice to the water division is needed to schedule shutdowns. However, shutdowns cannot be scheduled until a water/sewer/storm water application has been approved and all applicable fees have been paid in full. The city of Chehalis water division will be consulted regarding fittings or couplings required. It will be the contractor’s responsibility to verify the location and depth of the existing main and the fittings required to make the connections to the existing main. All excavation, connections, piping, tapping valve fittings, services, anchors, blocking, bedding, backfill, compaction, restoration and other labor and materials required will be furnished and placed by the contractor. The tapping of an existing water main will be done in the presence of a water division representative. The water division will be given two business days’ advance notice of a water main tap and they will perform all shutdowns on existing mains. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.03), 2005; Ord. 767B, 2004.]


12.04.390 Service interruption.

The contractor will give the public works department a minimum of five business days’ advance notice of any planned connection to an existing pipeline. This includes all cut-ins and live taps. Notice is required so disruptions to existing services can be scheduled and affected customers notified. The contractor will make every effort to schedule water main construction with minimum disruption of water service. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the excavation and shoring procedures comply with L&I standards for worker safety. If these procedures are not followed, the connection will not be performed. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.04), 2005.]


12.04.400 Hydrants.

A. The lead from the service main to the fire hydrant will be ductile iron cement mortar lined Class 52, no less than six inches in diameter. A gate valve will be installed a minimum of three feet from the hydrant, unless otherwise approved.

B. Fire hydrants will have two two-and-one-half-inch outlets with National Standard threads and one four-inch pumper port outlet with Pacific Coast threads (male threaded 4.72-inch diameter). The pumper port will be fitted with a five-inch quick connect Storz adapter with a Pacific Coast thread hydrant connection (female threaded four-and-three-fourths-inch diameter). The Storz adapter will include a cap. The hydrant valve opening will be five-and-one-fourth-inch diameter. The hydrant will have a positive and automatic barrel drain and will be of the “safety” or breakaway style.

Hydrants will be Mueller Centurion A-423, M&H Reliant Style 129, Clow Medallion or Kennedy Guardian K81D, Waterous Pacer Model WB-67-250 or AVK 2780. Alternate hydrant styles and manufacturers will be considered on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the director of public works. All hydrants will be bagged and the connecting gate valves will remain closed until the system is tested and approved. Developments being served by existing hydrants will be required to upgrade to these standards and use the same type of hydrant throughout the development. Hydrants will be painted with sunburst yellow high-grade enamel after installation.

C. The department of public works and Chehalis fire department will work together to determine the required hydrant spacing for installation. All hydrants will be installed and placed in a manner that provides accessibility to the fire department and their equipment as determined by both departments.

Unless otherwise required by the public works department, the following guidelines will apply for hydrant number and location:

1. At least one hydrant will be installed at all intersections.

2. Hydrant spacing of 300 feet will be required in all areas except single-family and duplex residential areas.

3. Hydrant spacing of 500 feet will be required for single-family and duplex residential areas.

4. The spacing distance for hydrants will be measured along the frontage street(s) and/or accessible side street(s) only. When determining the sufficiency of existing hydrants related to hydrant placement and spacing, hydrants located behind or on parallel streets or alleys, or hydrants with flows less than the minimum fire flows listed in CMC 12.04.380(A), will not be considered.

5. When any portion of a proposed building is in excess of 150 feet from a water supply on a public street or right-of-way, privately owned on-site hydrants will be required. Such hydrants will be located per the Chehalis fire department and the International Fire Code. The hydrants will be privately maintained and will include the appropriate metering and backflow prevention, as noted in these standards. A proposed maintenance schedule will be submitted to the city for review prior to final approval of the engineering plans.

D. Fire hydrants will be installed as detailed in Standard Drawing 4-8.

E. For requirements regarding use, size and location of a fire department connection (FDC) and/or post indicator valve, contact the fire department. Location of the FDC will be shown on all water plans.

F. When necessary, the public works department may require hydrants to be protected by two or more posts, four-inch diameter by five feet high, made of either reinforced concrete or steel.

G. Fire hydrants must be installed, tested, and accepted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.05), 2005; Ord. 767B, 2004.]


12.04.410 Valves.

All valves and fittings will be ductile iron with ANSI flanges or mechanical joint ends. All existing valves are to be operated by city employees only.

Valves will be installed in the distribution system at sufficient intervals to facilitate system repair and maintenance, but in no case will there be less than one valve every 1,000 feet. Generally, there will be two valves on each tee and three valves on each cross. Specific requirements for valve spacing will be made at the plan review stage.

A. Gate valves will be used on all two- to 12-inch lines. The design, materials and workmanship of all gate valves will conform to the most recent revision of AWWA C509-87. Gate valves will be resilient wedge nonrising stem (NRS) with two internal O-ring stem seals. Gate valves will be Mueller, M&H, Kennedy, Clow R/W or Waterous Series 500.

B. Butterfly valves will be used on all lines 14 inches and larger. Butterfly valves will conform to AWWA C504-87, Class 150B, with cast iron short body and O-ring stem seals. Butterfly valves will be Mueller, Linseal III, Kennedy, Pratt Groundhog, or Allis Chalmers.

C. Valve Box. All valves will have a standard Olympic Foundry 910 or 940 water valve box as determined by the water division. If the city approves or requires the use of an Olympic 910 valve box, it will be set to grade with a six-inch ASTM 3034 SDR 35 PVC riser from valve to approximately six inches from the valve box top. If valves are not set in a paved area, a three-by-three-foot concrete pad four inches thick will be set around each valve box at finished grade. An Olympic Foundry 940 valve box will be required for all locations of heavy traffic. In areas where the valve box is on the shoulder of the road, the ditch and shoulder will be graded before placing an asphalt or concrete pad. Valve box lids will be ductile iron, anti-kickout, and marked “WATER” (see Standard Drawing 4‑12). All valve locations will be marked on the face of the adjacent curb with a “WV” embossed one-fourth inch into the concrete. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.06), 2005.]


12.04.420 Casing.

Steel casing pipe will be schedule 20 steel or equal. Pipe spacers will have eight-inch runners. Casting pipe and spacers will be sized for pipe being installed with a minimum of three spacers per section of pipe. The casing pipe will then be sand-packed and sealed in accordance with the spacer manufacturer’s recommendations. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.07), 2005.]


12.04.430 Air and vacuum release valve.

Air and vacuum release valves (ARV) will be APCO combination air release valves. Installation will be as shown on Standard Drawing 4-9.

The installation will be set at the high point of the line when required. Where possible, pipes are to be graded to prevent the need for an air release valve. Air release valves may not be required when services are in the vicinity; however, the final determination will be made by the public works department. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.08), 2005.]


12.04.440 Blowoff assembly.

If a fire hydrant is not located at the end of a dead-end main, a blowoff assembly will be required. On water mains that may be extended in the future, the valve that operates the blowoff assembly will be the same size as the main and provided with a saddle block along the last length of the pipe preceding the valve, in lieu of a thrust block at the end. The working pressure rating for blowoff assemblies will be a minimum of 200 psi. Installation will be as shown on Standard Drawing 4-10. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.09), 2005.]


12.04.450 Backflow prevention.

All water system connections providing buildings or properties with domestic potable water, fire suppression or irrigation systems will comply with the backflow prevention requirements as established by the Department of Health (DOH), WAC and the city of Chehalis cross-connection control program.

Having an approved backflow assembly(s) installed is necessary to protect the city water system and all users from any possible contamination. All backflow assemblies installed will be of a type and model preapproved by the DOH or the city. No cross-connections will be created, installed, used, or maintained within the city of Chehalis water system. A list of approved testers may be obtained from the Washington Environmental Training Resource Center (WETRC) located in Auburn, Washington.

In-premises cross-connections must have an approved backflow assembly(s) in place in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC). The city may require additional in-premises and/or premises protection in accordance with the DOH and the city of Chehalis cross-connection control plan when health hazards are determined to exist.

All assemblies must be installed in accordance with the most recent versions of the city of Chehalis cross-connection control program, the DOH, UPC, and the PNWS/AWWA Cross-Connection Control Manual. In addition, all assemblies must be inspected and approved by the city’s cross-connection specialist (CCS). The CCS may also conduct an on-site inspection of new and/or existing backflow assemblies during testing. The city will release or issue a certificate of occupancy only after all backflow assemblies have passed a certified test.

Any person violating any provision of the city of Chehalis cross-connection control plan will be subject to penalties as stated under CMC 13.04.070(G) and (H).

A. Backflow Assemblies. The definitions, abbreviations and acronyms relating to cross-connections frequently used in cross-connection control are found in the Washington State Department of Health Water System Design Manual as applies to “Group A” public water systems. Accepted backflow prevention assemblies are RPBA, RPDA, DCVA, DCDA, PVBA or SVBA of a make, model, and size that has been approved by the DOH. Assemblies on the current approved backflow prevention assemblies list developed by the University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research are also approved.

B. Installation Requirements. Backflow prevention assemblies used for premises isolation will be installed at the expense of the user, downstream from the city’s water metering device, but within six feet of the meter box or before any other use connection, to protect the water distribution system from any potential hazard, as determined by the city. All assemblies must be installed in accordance with the most current versions of the city of Chehalis cross-connection control plan, DOH requirements, UPC, and the PNWS/AWWA Cross-Connection Control Manual.

In-premises installation of backflow assemblies can be installed only with written permission by the city’s CCS or may be mandated along with premises isolation when high health hazards are determined to exist by the CCS. All backflow assemblies (premises or in-premises) must be readily accessible to city personnel during regular working hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. If there is a change of ownership of an in-premises backflow assembly and/or at any time all requirements are not met, the city of Chehalis has the right to enforce premises isolation and will follow the procedures established in the city of Chehalis cross-connection control plan, Section 6 (a – f). The city of Chehalis must be notified within two business days of the completion of a backflow assembly installation. Upon notification, the city’s CCS will then inspect the installation to determine compliance with all applicable requirements.

All backflow assembly installations are also required to be tested by a Washington State DOH-certified backflow assembly tester (BAT) with an annual certificate of accuracy for their testing equipment on file with the city. The test results must be sent to the city showing the backflow assembly having successfully passed the certified test. The property owner must schedule a backflow test annually.

C. Costs of Compliance. All costs associated with purchase, installation, inspections, testing, replacement, maintenance, parts and repairs of a backflow assembly are the responsibility of the property owner/user.

D. Termination of Services. Failure on the part of any customer to correct all cross-connections in accordance with these standards is sufficient cause for the immediate discontinuance of public water service to the premises. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.10), 2005.]


12.04.460 Service connection.

A. All service connection sizes used for new development will be determined by industry standards and approved by the public works department or designated consultant and installed by the developer at the time of mainline construction. After the lines have been constructed, tested and approved, the owner may request a water meter. The city will install a water meter only after a water/sewer/storm application has been completed, all applicable fees paid and the system inspected and approved. With the placement of one-and-one-half-inch or two-inch meter setters (Standard Drawing No. 4-3), the contractor shall install the meter at the time the setter is put in place. The contractor shall contact the city two business days prior to the installation of the setter and coordinate the delivery of the meter with the installation of the setter. Meter and gasket will be supplied by the city. The city will lock off the setter after the contractor has installed the meter.

B. When water is desired for a parcel fronting an existing main but not served by an existing setter, a water/sewer/storm application must be completed and returned to the city. Upon approval of the application and payment of all applicable fees, the city will tap the main and install the meter, box, and setter.

C. Service lines will be Type K soft copper. All connections will be of Ford, McDonald or Mueller 110 compression connection fittings. Service lines will be installed a minimum of 22.5 degrees off the main. Tracer tape will be installed over all service lines.

Service saddles will be ductile iron with double stainless steel traps. All clamps will have rubber gasket and iron pipe threaded inlet, and iron pipe threaded or approved compression outlet connections.

Corporation stops will be all U.S. brass and will be Ford, Mueller, or A.Y. McDonald with iron pipe (IP) threads with tapping saddles and CC threads on direct taps conforming to AWWA C800.

D. Master meters will not be allowed for service to more than one building. An approved backflow prevention system must be installed in conjunction with any master meter, in accordance with the requirements outlined in this article. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (4.11), 2005.]


12.04.470 Marking service lines.

The location of all service lines will be marked on the face or top of the cement concrete curb with a “W” embossed one-fourth inch into the concrete. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.12), 2005.]


12.04.480 Water main/sanitary sewer crossings.

The contractor will maintain a minimum of 18 inches of vertical separation between sanitary sewers and water mains – with the water mains being at the higher elevation. If the minimum vertical separation cannot be met, the standards for water/sewer separation from the DOE Guidelines as shown in this section will apply.

The longest standard length of water pipe will be installed so that the joints will fall equidistant from any sewer crossing. In cases where minimum separation cannot be maintained, it may be necessary to utilize water main-rated pipe for the sewer line, or to encase the water pipe and/or sewer line in pipe or concrete. No concrete will be installed unless specifically directed by the public works department or designated consultant.

12.04.490 Irrigation.

All irrigation systems will be installed with a backflow prevention assembly approved by the Department of Health or the city of Chehalis. Irrigation sprinklers will be situated so as to not wet any public street or sidewalk. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.14), 2005.]


12.04.500 Staking.

All surveying and staking will be performed by an engineering or surveying firm licensed by the state of Washington and capable of performing such work. A preconstruction meeting will be held with the city prior to commencing staking and all staking will be inspected by the city prior to construction and maintained throughout construction.

The minimum staking of water lines will be as follows:

A. Stake centerline alignment every 25 feet (50 feet in tangent sections), with cuts and/or fills to bottom of trench maintaining the minimum required depth of cover over pipe. Centerline cuts are not required when road grade is to finished subgrade elevation.

B. Stake location of all fire hydrants, hydrant flange elevations, tees, water meters, setters and other fixtures with cut or fill to finished grade. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.15), 2005.]


12.04.510 Trench excavation.

A. Clearing and grubbing, when required, will be performed within the easement or public right-of-way as permitted by the city and/or governing agencies. All debris resulting from clearing and grubbing must be disposed of by the owner or contractor in accordance with the terms of the applicable permits.

B. Trenches will be excavated to the line and depth designated by the city to provide a minimum of 30 inches of cover over the pipe and, to the extent practical, a maximum of 42 inches of cover over the pipe. Except for unusual circumstances where approved by the city, the trench sides will be excavated vertically and the trench width will be excavated only to such widths as are necessary for adequate working space as allowed by the governing agency. The trench will be kept free from water until pipe assembly is complete. Surface water will be diverted so as not to enter the trench. The owner will maintain sufficient pumping equipment on the job to ensure that these provisions are carried out.

C. The contractor will perform excavation of every description and of whatever substance encountered including boulders, rocks, roots and other obstructions. All material will be entirely removed or cut out to the width of the trench and to a depth six inches below water main grade. Where materials are removed from below water main grade, the trench will be backfilled to grade with thoroughly compacted material that is satisfactory to the city.

Pipe placed in the trench will be sealed with a watertight plug at the end of each day. More frequent use of a watertight plug may be required at the discretion of the city.

D. Trenching and shoring operations will not proceed more than 100 feet in advance of pipe laying without approval of the city, and will be in conformance with the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Administration (WISHA) and Office of Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Safety Standards. The contractor will also maintain the presence of a “competent person” as defined by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries when any trench excavation and backfill work is being done at the project site.

E. The bottom of the trench will be finished to grade with hand tools in such a manner that the pipe will have bearing along the entire length of the barrel. The bell holes will be excavated with hand tools to sufficient size to make up the joint. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.16), 2005.]


12.04.520 Thrust blocking.

Location of thrust blocking will be shown on plans. Thrust block concrete will be Class B poured against undisturbed earth. A plastic barrier will be placed between all thrust blocks and fittings. The city shall require the use of MEGALUG restrainers, Romac retainers or restraining rods in lieu of and/or in conjunction with thrust blocking. See Standard Drawings 4-13 and 4-14 for thrust block locations and calculations. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.17), 2005.]


12.04.530 Backfilling.

Backfilling will not commence until the pipe installation has been inspected and approved by a city inspector. Backfilling and surface restoration will closely follow installation of pipe so that not more than 100 feet is left exposed during construction hours without approval of the city.

Selected bedding material conforming to WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications will be placed and compacted around and under the water mains by hand tools to a height of six inches above the top of the water main. The remaining backfill will be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density in traveled areas, 90 percent outside traveled areas. The city will have the discretion of requiring the use of control density fill (CDF) for backfill material for road crossings.

Where governmental agencies other than the city have jurisdictions over roadways, the backfill and compaction will be done to the satisfaction of the agency having jurisdiction, but in no case will the backfilling or compaction be to a lower standard than that of the city. If suitable backfill material, as determined by the city, is not available from trenching operations, the city may require the placement of bedding and/or a gravel base conforming to the current WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.18), 2005.]


12.04.540 Street patching and restoration.

See CMC 12.04.280(O) and (P) for requirements regarding street patching and trench restoration. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.19), 2005.]


12.04.550 Hydrostatic tests.

Prior to the acceptance of work, installation will be subject to a hydrostatic pressure test by the contractor. All pumps, gauges, plugs, saddles, corporation stops, miscellaneous hose and piping, and measuring equipment necessary for performing the test will be furnished and operated by the contractor. Tests will be conducted only after all connections along the section to be tested have been made and the roadway section is constructed to subgrade.

The section of water main being tested will be filled with water and allowed to stand under pressure for a sufficient length of time to allow air to escape and the pipe lining to absorb water. The contractor will be responsible for all costs, labor and materials associated with the testing of the line. The contractor will pay for all water needed for testing at the current rate charged by the city.

The test will be accomplished by pumping the main up to a pressure 150 psi above normal operating pressures but in no case will the test pressure be less than 200 psi. After reaching the test pressure, the pump will be stopped for 15 minutes and then the pressure brought back up to the test pressure again. The quantity of water used to restore the pressure will be accurately determined by pumping through a positive displacement water meter. The meter will be approved by the public works department prior to testing.

Acceptability of the test will be determined by using the following formula:

	L =	N x D x (P^1/2)

	 	7400

	L = allowable leakage, gallons per hour (gph)

	N = number of joints in the length of pipeline tested

	D = nominal diameter of pipe, inches

	P = average test pressure during the leakage test, psi

If the water used to restore the pressure in the system is greater than the allowable leakage determined by the formula, the main will be considered to have failed. There will not be any appreciable or abrupt loss in pressure during the 15-minute test period. Any significant loss will also be grounds for a nonpassing test. Should the tested section fail to pass the pressure test as specified, the contractor will, at no expense to the city, locate and repair the defects and then retest the pipeline. All tests will be made with the hydrant auxiliary gate valves open and pressure against the hydrant valve. After the test has been completed, each gate valve will be tested individually by closing each in turn and relieving the pressure beyond. This test will be acceptable if there is no immediate loss of pressure on the gauge when the pressure comes against the valve being checked. The contractor will verify that the pressure across the valve does not exceed the rated working pressure of the valve.

Sections to be tested will normally be limited to 1,500 feet. The public works department or designated consultant may require that the first section of the pipe installed by the contractor, not less than 1,000 feet in length, be tested in order to qualify the crew and the material. Pipe installation will not be continued for more than an additional 1,000 feet until the first section has been successfully tested.

Prior to calling a city inspector to witness the pressure test, the contractor will have all equipment ready for operation and have successfully performed the test to ensure that the pipe is in satisfactory condition.

Defective material or workmanship discovered during a hydrostatic field test will be replaced by the contractor at no expense to the city. Whenever it is necessary to replace defective material or correct workmanship, the hydrostatic test will be rerun at the contractor’s expense until a satisfactory test is obtained. Test pressure will be maintained while the installation is inspected by the city. See CMC 12.04.450 for testing responsibilities related to backflow prevention devices. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (4.20), 2005.]


12.04.560 Sterilization and flushing.

Sterilization of water mains will be accomplished by the contractor in accordance with the requirements of the Washington State Department of Health, AWWA Standards and in a manner approved by the city. At no time will chlorinated water from a new main be flushed into a body of water, including lakes, rivers, streams, drainage ways, and all waters where fish or other natural water life can be expected. Any discharge into a city sewer system must be approved in advance and in writing by the wastewater superintendent.

When the proper chlorine concentration has been established throughout the line, the valves will be closed and the line left undisturbed for 24 hours. The line will then be thoroughly flushed and water samples taken by the city at least 24 hours after flushing and disinfecting. Sampling collection should be scheduled with the engineering division at least two business days in advance. Should the initial chlorine treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacteriological test, the procedure must be repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. The contractor will be responsible for all costs if retesting becomes necessary. Samples can only be taken on Mondays and Tuesdays. Testing and sampling will take place after all underground utilities are installed and compaction of the backfill within the roadway section is complete. [Ord. 785B § 14 (4.21), 2005.]

Article VI. Sanitary Sewer


12.04.570 General considerations.

A. General. “Sanitary sewerage” refers to wastewater derived from domestic, commercial and industrial pretreated waste to which storm, surface, and ground water are not intentionally admitted. Pretreatment will follow all the requirements as set forth by city ordinances and public works departmental policies.

Any extension of the city of Chehalis sanitary sewer system must be approved by the public works department and must be consistent with the city of Chehalis comprehensive sewer plan, city of Chehalis general sewer plan, Department of Ecology, and Department of Health requirements.

Within the corporate city limits, where public sewer is available it must be used. Connection is not required; provided, that the sewage from the structure originates more than 200 feet from the public sewer, except in the case of private residential or commercial developments where the developed property abuts a right-of-way in which a public sewer is located or where a service connection is otherwise provided. In this case, connection of all structures generating sewage will be required to connect to the public sewer regardless of distance.

Anyone who wishes to extend or connect to the city sewer system will contact the public works department for a water/sewer/storm application. If a sewer line extension is being requested, a written request that specifically lists and details the line extension must be submitted to the public works department. The extension will be extended to and through the extremes of the property frontage being developed for future development; provided, that further utility extension is possible, as determined by the public works director. After the water/sewer/storm application is approved, along with any other information as may be required or requested, city staff will determine estimated fees.

See CMC 12.04.060 for definitions of specific sewers. Maintenance of the building sewer will be the responsibility of the property owner, while the remaining sewer lateral will be the city’s responsibility.

B. Marking Side Sewers. The location of all side sewers will be marked on the face or top of the cement concrete curb with an “S” embossed one-fourth inch into concrete.

C. Sanitary Sewer/Water Main Crossings. See CMC 12.04.480 for requirements regarding sewer and water separation.

D. Staking.

1. All surveying and staking will be performed by an engineering or surveying firm licensed by the state of Washington and possessing the appropriate business license(s) to perform such work.

2. A preconstruction meeting will be held with the public works department and the engineering division prior to commencing staking. All construction staking will be inspected by the city prior to construction. Staking will be maintained throughout construction.

3. The minimum staking of sewer lines will be as follows:

a. Centerline alignment must be staked with cuts and/or fills to flow at 25 feet and 50 feet from each manhole or structure and every 50 feet thereafter, unless more frequent staking is required for construction at the discretion of a city representative.

b. Manholes must be staked with hubs to include invert elevations of all pipes and top of rim elevations to finished grade.

c. Location of valves, fixtures and septic tank will be staked for force mains and STEP systems.

E. Trench Excavation. See CMC 12.04.510 for requirements regarding trench excavation.

F. Backfilling. See CMC 12.04.530 for requirements regarding backfilling.

G. Street Patching and Restoration. See CMC 12.04.280(O) and (P) for requirements regarding street patching and trench restoration.

H. Testing. Prior to acceptance and approval of construction, the following tests will apply to each type of construction:

1. Gravity Sewer.

a. After the pipes have been cleaned, and prior to acceptance of the project, the gravity sewer line will be subject to a low pressure air test per WSDOT/APWA standards. The contractor will furnish all equipment and personnel for conducting the test under the observation of a city inspector. The testing equipment will be subject to approval of the public works department or designated consultant.

Prior to calling a city inspector to witness the test, the contractor will have all equipment ready and have successfully performed the test. The air test for acceptance will be made after the trench is backfilled and compacted and the roadway section is completed to subgrade.

All wyes, tees, and ends of side sewer stubs will be plugged with flexible joint caps, or acceptable alternates, securely fastened to withstand the internal test pressures. Such plugs or caps will be readily removable and their removal will provide an opening suitable for a lateral connection or extension that conforms to these standards.

b. Testing of the sewer main will include a television inspection by the contractor, conducted under the direct supervision of an engineering inspector. Sewer laterals that cannot be otherwise checked for grade may be required to be televised using the same procedures as a sewer main, as determined by the public works director. Failure to have a city representative present will invalidate the test and the test will be repeated at the contractor’s expense. Television inspections will be done after the air test has passed, the manhole has been channeled and before the roadway is paved. Immediately prior to the television inspection, enough water will be run down the line to come out the lower manhole. A sediment trap will be installed in the downstream manhole prior to flushing the line. The sediment trap and all the material it collects will be removed before the line is placed into service. A copy of the video and a written report will be submitted to the engineering division. Acceptance of the line will be made after the tape has been reviewed and approved by a city inspector. Any connection to an existing system will need to be televised as well.

The city may televise the new sewer line during periods of high ground water within the first year after acceptance of the line. Any conditions resulting in inflow and infiltration (I&I) will be considered a system failure that will be repaired by and at the expense of the contractor.

c. A vacuum test of all manholes is required prior to acceptance. The structure will be tested in accordance with ASTM C1244-93. This test method covers procedures for testing cast-in-place or pre-cast concrete manhole sections, using the vacuum test method to demonstrate the integrity of the installed materials and construction procedures. Testing will be in the following manner:

i. All lift holes and pipes entering into the manhole will be plugged, taking care to securely brace each plug from being drawn into the structure.

ii. The test head will be placed at the top portion of the structure in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

iii. A vacuum of 10 inches of mercury will be drawn on the manhole, the valve on the vacuum line of the test head closed, and the vacuum pump shut off. With the valves closed, the time will be measured for the vacuum to drop by one to nine inches. The manhole will pass the vacuum test if the time is greater than the time shown in Table 1 below.

Table 1. Minimum Test Times for Various Manhole Diameters  

	Depth in Feet	Diameter in Inches

	30	33	38	42	48	54	60	66	72

	Time in Seconds

	26	36	39	46	55	64	75	85	94	105

	28	39	42	49	59	69	81	91	101	113

	30	42	45	53	63	74	87	98	108	121

Table 1 gives allowable time in seconds, i.e., test section is acceptable if vacuum does not drop below nine inches until after the times shown have expired.

iv. If the manhole fails the initial test, necessary repairs will be made by an approved method. The structure will then be retested until a satisfactory test is obtained.

v. If the manhole joint is displaced during the vacuum test, the manhole will be disassembled, the seal replaced, the structure reassembled, and retested until compliance is obtained.

vi. Testing can be done either before or after backfill operations around the structure; however, if during backfill operations it is found that the structure has been disturbed and it is suspected that the integrity of the joint has been compromised, retesting will be required.

vii. All other requirements stipulated in Section 7-05 of the most recent edition of the Washington State Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction, that has been adopted by the city, will also be adhered to for final acceptance of the manhole structure.

d. A mandrel test in accordance with Section 7-17.3(4)H of the WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications will be performed by and at the expense of the contractor on all sewers except laterals (as defined in Article II of this chapter) when televising reveals a possible defect or belly in the pipe.

e. Any time that testing reveals problems that lead to repairs by the contractor, the city may require a complete retesting of the entire system. The retest will be required to ensure that the integrity of the system was not compromised during the repair work.

2. Force Main.

a. Prior to roadway paving and final acceptance of the project, the pressure and service lines will be subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test of 100 pounds per square inch for 15 minutes and any leaks or imperfections which develop under said pressure will be remedied by the contractor. No air will be allowed in the line. The main will be tested between valves. Insofar as possible, no hydrostatic pressure will be placed against the opposite side of the valve being tested. The pressure test will be maintained while the entire installation is inspected.

The contractor will provide all necessary equipment and will perform all work connected with the tests. Tests will be made after all connections have been made. This is to include any and all connections as shown on the plan. The contractor will perform all tests to assure that the equipment to be used for the test is adequate and in good operating condition and the air in the line has been released before requesting a city inspector to witness the test.

b. A water test for all wet wells in accordance with the manhole water test for gravity sewers will be required.

c. A mandrel test in accordance with Section 7-17.3(4)H of the Standard Specifications may be required, at the discretion of the public works department or designated consultant.

d. The contractor must provide verification of operating parameters such as pump operation, alarms, and electrical inspections. Inspections are to be conducted in the presence of a city inspector. The final verification will be documented in a written report that will be submitted to the city for review and approval prior to acceptance of all lift stations.

3. STEP System.

a. Prior to final acceptance of the project, the pressure mainline and service lines will be subject to a hydrostatic pressure test of 200 pounds for 15 minutes and all leaks or imperfections that develop will be remedied by the contractor. No air will be allowed in the line. The main will be tested between valves. Insofar as possible, no hydrostatic pressure will be placed against the opposite side of the valve being tested. The pressure test will be maintained while the entire installation is inspected.

The contractor will provide all necessary equipment and will perform all work connected with the tests. Tests will be made after all connections have been made. The contractor will perform all tests to assure that the equipment to be used for the test is adequate and in good operating condition and the air in the line has been released prior to requesting a city inspector to witness the test.

b. A water test of the STEP tank at the factory and on site after installation is required in accordance with the criteria outlined in CMC 12.04.610(G). The contractor will perform the test and supply all necessary equipment and materials. The testing will be conducted in the presence of a city inspector. Tests commence by 3:00 p.m. to ensure adequate time for testing to be conducted during the standard workday.

c. The contractor must provide verification of operating parameters such as pump operation, alarms, and electrical inspections. Inspections shall be conducted in the presence of a city inspector. The final verification will be documented in a written report that will be submitted to the city for review and approval prior to acceptance of all STEP systems.

I. Design Standards. The general notes that follow will be included on all plans dealing with sewage system design. In addition, the specific notes with gravity sewer and STEP systems will be included when these utilities are part of the project.

General Notes (Sanitary Sewer Main Installation)

1.    All workmanship and materials will be in accordance with city of Chehalis standards and the most recent copy of the State of Washington Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge and Municipal Construction (WSDOT/APWA).

2.    City of Chehalis datum will be used for all vertical control. A list of benchmarks is available at the public works department.

3.    All approvals and permits required by the city of Chehalis will be obtained by the contractor prior to the start of construction.

4.    If construction is to take place in the county right-of-way, the contractor will notify the county and obtain all the required approvals and permits.

5.    A preconstruction meeting will be held with the public works department and the engineering division prior to the start of construction.

6.    The engineering division will be notified a minimum of two business days in advance of a tap connection to an existing main. A city inspector will be present at the time of the tap.

7.    The contractor will be fully responsible for the location and protection of all existing utilities. The contractor will verify all utility locations prior to construction by calling the Utilities Underground Location Center at 1-800-424-5555 a minimum of two business days prior to any excavation.

8.    All sewer mains will be field staked for grades and alignment by a licensed engineering or surveying firm qualified to perform such work. Staking will be maintained throughout construction.

9.    All pipe and services will be installed with continuous tracer tape placed 12 to 18 inches under the proposed finished subgrade. The marker will be of plastic, nonbiodegradable, metal core or backing marked “SEWER” that can be detected by a standard metal detector. If visibility cannot be maintained between structures along the straight alignment of a sewer, toning wire will be installed above the sewer line at a depth no greater than 48 inches. Tape will be Terra Tape “D” or an approved equal. In addition, STEP mains, force mains, and curvilinear sewers will be installed with toning wire taped to the top of the pipe to prevent movement during backfill.

    If toning wire is required, it will be UL listed, Type UF, 14-gauge copper. The wire will be laid loosely enough to prevent stretching and damage. The wire will be wrapped to a manhole or cleanout rings on gravity sewer or valve body on STEP mains.

    A one-pound magnesium anode will be buried with the pipe every 1,000 linear feet maximum for cathodic protection of the wire. Toning wire splices and connections to anodes will join wires both mechanically and electrically and will employ epoxy resin or heat-shrink tape insulation. Toning wire will be tested prior to acceptance of the pipe system. A written notice from the contractor to the city two business days prior to testing is required. On a curvilinear sewer, the wire will be brought up, bared and wrapped three times around the manhole ring. The tape and wire will be furnished and installed by the contractor.

10.    Bedding of the sewer main and compaction of the backfill material will be required in accordance with the above specification (see General Note 1).

11.    All manholes and cleanouts outside the paved area will be installed in accordance with Standard Drawings 5-3 and 5-5.

12.    When temporary street patching is allowed by the city, cold mix asphalt will be placed to a maximum depth of one inch. The contractor will be responsible for maintenance as required by the city.

13.    Erosion control measures conforming to the most recent version of the city of Chehalis storm water management plan and Article IV of this chapter will be taken by the contractor during construction to prevent infiltration of existing and proposed storm drainage facilities and roadways.

14.    Provide traffic control plan(s) in accordance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as required.

15.    It will be the responsibility of the contractor to have a copy of the approved construction plans on site at all times. Approved plans are typically signified by the signature of the director of public works or designated consultant.

16.    Any changes to the design will first be reviewed and approved by the developer’s project engineer and the director of public works or designated consultant prior to implementation.

17.    Prior to backfill, all mains and appurtenances will be inspected and approved by a city inspector. Approval does constitute final acceptance of the sewer line. The contractor will retain responsibility to repair all deficiencies and failures revealed during all required testing for acceptance and throughout the duration of the warranty. It is the contractor’s responsibility to notify the engineering division in advance of all required inspections. Any main or appurtenance backfilled prior to inspection will be re-excavated for inspection at no cost to the city.

GRAVITY SEWER

1.    Gravity sewer mains will meet the following: PVC pipe will conform to ASTM P3034 SDR 35, ASTM F794, or ASTM F679 Type 1 with joints and gaskets conforming to ASTM 3212 and ASTM F477.

2.    Pre-cast manholes will meet the requirements of ASTM C478. Manholes will be Type 1-48'' as specified on the plans. Joints will be rubber gasket conforming to ASTM C443 and will be grouted from the inside. Lift holes will be grouted from the outside and inside of the manhole (see General Note 1).

3.    Side sewer services will be PVC, ASTM D3034 SDR 35 with flexible gasket joints. Side sewer connections will be made by a saddle tap to an existing main (see Standard Drawing 5-12), or a sanitary tee from a new main connected above the springline of the pipe. Side sewer services will be installed according to applicable Standard Detail(s).

4.    All side sewer locations will be marked on the face of the curb with an “S” embossed one-fourth inch into the concrete.

5.    All lines will be high velocity cleaned, televised, and subjected to a low pressure air test per current WSDOT/APWA Specifications after backfilling, but prior to paving (see General Note 1). Hydrant flushing of lines is not an acceptable cleaning method. Testing of the sanitary sewer main will include television inspecting of the main by and at the expense of the contractor in the presence of a city inspector. Immediately prior to television inspecting, enough water will be run down the line to come out the lower manhole and the line is flushed clean. A copy of the video will be submitted to the engineering division. Acceptance of the line will be made after the tape has been reviewed and approved by the inspector. A test of all manholes in accordance with these standards is also required. Testing will take place after all underground utilities are installed and compaction of the roadway subgrade is completed.

STEP SYSTEMS

1.    All buried power for STEP systems will be installed according to all current and applicable electrical codes.

2.    All buried power for STEP systems will be installed with continuous tracer tape installed 12 inches above the buried power. The marker will be plastic, nonbiodegradable metal core backing marked “POWER.” Tape to be furnished by the contractor.

3.    All STEP mains will be hydrostatically tested at 100 PSIG for 15 minutes according to the methods for hydrostatic testing of water lines in the most recent version of the WSDOT/APWA Specifications. All materials and labor are to be provided by the contractor. In addition, all STEP mains will be pigged in the presence of a city inspector, prior to placing the STEP main in service.

12.04.580 Gravity sewer.

A. General. All sewers will be designed as a gravity sewer whenever physically and/or economically feasible or as outlined in the city of Chehalis general sewer plan.

B. Design Standards. The design of any sewer extension/connection will conform to these standards, the Department of Ecology’s “Criteria of Sewage Works Design,” and any applicable standards as set forth herein.

The layout of extensions will provide for the future continuation of the existing system as determined by the city. See CMC 12.04.210 for utility extension information.

New gravity sewer systems will be designed on the basis of an average daily per capita flow of sewage of not less than 100 gallons per day. See the following DOE table on design basis for sewage. This figure is assumed to cover normal infiltration, but an additional allowance will be made where conditions are unfavorable. Generally, laterals and submain sewers should be designed to carry, when running full, not less than 400 gallons daily per capita contributions of sewage. When deviations from the foregoing per capita rates are used, a description of the procedure used for sewer design will be submitted to the engineering division and the public works department for review and approval.

C. Main Line – Gravity.

1. Sewer mains will be sized for the ultimate development of the tributary area. Nothing will preclude the city from requiring the installation of a larger-sized main if the city determines a larger size is needed to meet the requirements for future service.

The minimum size for mains will be eight-inch inside diameter. The minimum size for a lateral will be four inches.

2. Sewer mains will be constructed using materials conforming to the following:

a. PVC pipe six to 15 inches diameter must meet either ASTM D3034 SDR 35 solid wall pipe, or ASTM F794 for solid seamless profile pipe; or

b. PVC pipe 18 to 27 inches diameter will conform to ASTM F679 Type 1 only.

c. All joints for the PVC pipe will conform to ASTM D3212 with rubber gaskets conforming to ASTM F477.

3. Gravity sewer will maintain a minimum depth of five feet, unless otherwise approved, to provide gravity service to adjoining parcels and future areas to be served, adequate headroom within manholes for maintenance personnel and vertical clearance between water and sewer lines. Actual depth will be determined by slope, flow, velocity and elevation of existing system.

4. All sewer lateral connections to the main will be made with a sanitary tee connection. A cleanout will be provided at the edge of the right-of-way as shown in Standard Drawing 5-10. The direct connection of sewer laterals to interceptors is strictly prohibited. All new mains connecting to existing mains will require the installation of a new manhole if not made at an existing manhole. The city may require wyes at the upper extremity of a sewer line.

5. Slope. All sewers will be designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second based on Manning’s Formula using an “n” value of 0.013. Use of other practical “n” values may be permitted by the public works department or designated consultant, if deemed justifiable on the basis of research or field data submitted. The following are minimum slopes; however, slopes greater than these are desirable:

	Sewer Size (Inches)	Minimum % Slope (Feet per 100')

	8	0.40 (0.0040 Ft./Ft.)

	10	0.28 (0.0028 Ft./Ft.)

	12	0.22 (0.0022 Ft./Ft.)

	14	0.17 (0.0017 Ft./Ft.)

	15	0.15 (0.0015 Ft./Ft.)

	16	0.14 (0.0014 Ft./Ft.)

	18	0.12 (0.0012 Ft./Ft.)

	21	0.10 (0.0010 Ft./Ft.)

	24	0.08 (0.0008 Ft./Ft.)

	27	0.07 (0.0007 Ft./Ft.)

	30	0.06 (0.0006 Ft./Ft.)

	36	0.05 (0.0005 Ft./Ft.)

Under special conditions, slopes slightly less than is required for the two feet per second velocity may be permitted by the director of public works. Such decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be 30 percent of the diameter or greater for design average flow. Whenever such decreased slopes are proposed, the design engineer will furnish the city with the plans and computations of the depths of flow at minimum, average, and daily or hourly rates of flow. Larger pipe will not be allowed to achieve lesser slopes. Sewers will be laid with uniform slope between manholes.

6. Gravity sewers will be designed with a straight alignment between manholes.

D. Connection to Existing System.

1. At connection to the existing system, all new sewer connections will be physically plugged until all tests have been completed and the city approves the removal of the plug.

2. Connection of new pipelines to existing manholes will be accomplished by using core-drilled holes. The transition of connecting channels will be constructed so as not to interrupt existing flow patterns. All connections will utilize Kor-N-Seal fittings. Manholes that contain knockouts will not be permitted for use as part of the city sewer collection system.

3. Connection of a pipeline to a system without an existing manhole will be accomplished by pouring a concrete base and setting manhole sections. The existing pipe will not be cut into until approval is received from the city.

4. Connections to manholes requiring a drop will follow the criteria as outlined in this section.

5. Connections where an existing stub-out is not available or where a new building sewer is the same size as the existing main will be accomplished by the installation of a new manhole.

6. Taps will be done by use of a core drill and will not be allowed to protrude into the existing main. A city inspector will be notified two business days prior to any tap of a city sewer and will be present to witness the tap. The inspector will collect all tapping cores from the contractor, or will be informed if the cores were washed into the sewer.

E. Manholes.

1. Pre-cast manholes will meet the requirements of ASTM C478 with either a pre-cast base or a cast-in-place base made from 3,000 psi structural concrete. Pre-cast bases must be pre-channeled by the manufacturer. Manholes will be Type 1, 48-inch diameter minimum. The minimum clear opening in the manhole frame will be 24 inches. Joints will be rubber gasket conforming to ASTM C443 and will be grouted from the inside. Lift holes will be grouted from the outside and inside of the manhole.

2. Manholes constructed of other materials may be approved by the public works department or designated consultant, provided they meet the requirements of Section 2.318 of the Department of Ecology’s “Criteria for Sewage Works Design.” Material specifications need to be submitted for review before an alternate material will be considered. See Standard Drawings 5-1 and 5-2 for details.

3. Eccentric manhole cone will be offset so as not to be located in the tire track of a traveled lane.

4. Manhole frames and covers will be cast iron casting marked “SEWER” conforming to the requirements of ASTM A-30, Class 25, and will be free of porosity, shrink cavities, cold shuts, cracks, or any surface defects which would impair serviceability. Repairs of defects by welding or by the use of smooth-on or similar material will not be permitted. Manhole rings and covers will be machine-finished or ground-on seating surfaces so as to assure nonrocking fit in any position and interchangeability. Manholes located in areas subject to inflow will be equipped with an approved watertight manhole insert.

5. Where lock-type castings are called for, the casting device will be such that the cover may be readily released from the ring and all movable parts will be made of noncorrosive materials and otherwise arranged to avoid possible binding. The locking device will be made of a noncorrosive material or properly coated to protect against corrosion. All casting will be coated with a bituminous coating prior to delivery to the job site.

6. Safety steps will be fabricated of polypropylene conforming to an ASTM D-4101 specification, injection molded around a one-half-inch ASTM A-615 grade 60 steel reinforcing bar with antislip tread. Steps will project uniformly from the inside wall of the manhole. Steps will be installed to form a continuous vertical ladder with rungs equally spaced on 12-inch centers.

7. Manholes will be placed at standard maximum 300-foot intervals, and at changes in direction, grade or pipe size. Slope through the manhole will be one-tenth of one foot from invert in to invert out unless otherwise approved by the public works department or designated consultant.

8. Where a smaller sewer joint joins a larger one, the invert of the larger sewer should be lowered sufficiently to maintain the same energy gradient. An approximate method for securing these results is to place the 80 percent depth point of both sewers at the same elevation. Pipe material will be consistent between manholes.

9. Straight grades between invert out of last manhole and connection to existing are preferred over drops whenever possible. Care must be taken when designing steep grades so as not to create a situation of excessive velocity or excavation. Grade changes associated with “sweeps” will not be allowed. The angle between the line(s) entering a manhole and the line leaving will be no less than 90 degrees.

10. An outside drop connection will be provided for a sewer entering a manhole at an elevation of 24 inches or more above the manhole invert. Where the difference in elevation between the incoming sewer and the manhole invert is less than 24 inches, the invert will be filleted to prevent solids deposition. Outside drop structures will be constructed per Standard Drawing 5-4.

11. All manholes that are to be owned and maintained by the city will be accessible at all times to operations, maintenance equipment and vehicles. All-weather access drives may be required to provide a sufficient driving surface for city vehicles, at the discretion of the director of public works.

12. Manhole sizing will be determined by the following criteria:

a. Forty-Eight-Inch Manhole.

i. Two connecting pipes, eight- to 12-inch diameter;

ii. Three connecting pipes, eight- to 10-inch diameter, perpendicular;

iii. Four connecting pipes, eight-inch diameter, perpendicular.

b. Fifty-Four-Inch Manhole.

i. Two connecting pipes, eight- to 12-inch diameter with greater than a 45-degree deflection;

ii. Three connecting pipes, 10- to 12-inch diameter, perpendicular;

iii. Four connecting pipes, 10- to 12-inch diameter, perpendicular.

c. Seventy-Two-Inch Manhole.

i. Two connecting pipes, 15- to 18-inch diameter with less than a 45-degree deflection;

ii. Three connecting pipes, 15-inch diameter, perpendicular;

iii. Four connecting pipes, 15-inch diameter, perpendicular.

In the above criteria “deflection” refers to the angle between any two inlet pipe channels in the manhole.

The intent of the noted configurations is to provide adequate shelves and room for maintenance and performing television inspections. For other pipe configurations, the size of the manhole will be approved by the public works department or designated consultant.

F. High Velocity Protection. Where velocities greater than 15 feet per second are expected, special provisions such as thrust blocking and specific piping materials will be made to protect against displacement and hydrogen sulfide gas.

G. Cleanouts. Cleanouts are not an acceptable substitute for manholes; however, they may be used in lieu of manholes at the end of eight-inch-diameter lines of not more than 150 feet in length. Location of cleanout for building sewer is governed by sewer ordinances as included in the Chehalis Municipal Code and the Uniform Plumbing Code as adopted by the city.

All cleanouts in a right-of-way will be extended to grade and a three-foot-square by four-inch-thick concrete pad will be installed around all cleanouts that are not in a pavement area. See Standard Drawing 5-5.

H. Sewer Service to Private Properties. “Building sewer” refers to the extension from a building’s discharge plumbing (two feet outside of the building) to the edge of pavement or curb line and will have no other common sewers discharging into it. Building sewers will be a minimum diameter of four inches for residential service and six inches for all other services. Maintenance of the building sewer is the responsibility of the property owner.

“Sewer lateral” refers to the extension from the building sewer at the end of pavement or curb line to the sewer main. Sewer laterals will be a minimum diameter of six inches. Maintenance of the sewer lateral is the responsibility of the city. Each property will be served by an individual sewer lateral. In addition, each unit of a duplex will be served by separate laterals.

Prior to connection or installation of building sewers or sewer laterals, a side sewer permit must be obtained from the city. Materials and design criteria for a building sewer are covered by the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) as adopted by the city. Inspection of the sewer lateral and building sewer from two feet outside the structure to the sewer main is the responsibility of the engineering division.

In order to avoid the possibility of backup in the sewer lateral from head pressures in the sewer main, the public works department or designated consultant may require that a backwater valve be installed at the property owner’s expense. Operation and maintenance of the backwater valve will be the responsibility of the property owner. [Ord. 819B §§ 13, 17, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (5B), 2005.]

[Ord. 785B § 14 (5C), 2005.]


12.04.600 Pressure sewer (force main).

A. General. Low-pressure systems, i.e., force mains, may be considered for situations where high ground water table or topography makes gravity sewer impractical. STEP systems are addressed separately in CMC 12.04.610.

B. Design Standards. The design of any sewer extension/connection will conform to city standards, the Department of Ecology’s “Criteria of Sewage Works Design,” and any applicable standards as set forth herein and in CMC 12.04.070 and 12.04.160.

The layout of extensions will provide for the future continuation of the existing system as determined by the city. In addition, main extensions will be extended to and across the side of the affected property fronting the main.

The system will be designed at full depth of flow on the basis of an average daily per capita flow as shown on the table in CMC 12.04.580(B). A coefficient of friction of 120 will be used for the Hazen-Williams “C” value.

New sewer systems will be designed by methods in conjunction with the basis of per capita flow rates. Methods will include the use of peaking factors for the contributing area, allowances for future commercial and industrial areas, and modification of per capita flow rates based on specific data. Documentation of the alternative method used will be provided along with plans. Applicable general notes in CMC 12.04.570 will be included on all plans dealing with pressure sanitary sewer design.

C. Force Main.

1. Material. Force mains up to 12 inches will be ductile iron AWWA C151 Class 50 or PVC C900 with ductile iron fittings and gasket joints. For 14- to 24-inch mains, pipe will be ductile iron C151 Class 50 or PVC C905 with ductile iron fittings and gasket joints. A more rigid pipe may be required where unlimited trench widths occur. All ductile iron pipe and fittings will be epoxy coated or PE lined and designed for use with corrosive materials.

2. Depth. Force mains will have a minimum 36 inches of cover to top of pipe. See CMC 12.04.480 for sanitary sewer/water main crossing requirements.

3. Velocity. The minimum velocity allowed is two feet per second (fps) at average dry weather flow. Two fps is required to maintain solids in suspension although three fps is desired to scour settled solids. Maximum velocity allowed will be eight fps.

4. Locate. Force mains will include toning wire, cathodic protection and tracer tape installed in accordance with requirements herein.

D. Air/Vacuum Valves. Air release valves and air/vacuum valves will be located at the high points of the line within a manhole or approved vault that provides 18 inches of clearance on all sides between the assembly of the wall(s). Air release valves will be fitted with an activated carbon canister to prevent the release of disagreeable odors to the surrounding area. Grades will be designed to minimize the need for air/vacuum valves when practical. Vehicular access to the valve is required for maintenance.

E. Force Main Drain. Provisions to drain a force main to facilitate repairs or to temporarily remove a force main from service will be provided. This may be accomplished through the use of a valved tee connected to a drain line at its low point with isolation valves on both sides of the tee along the main. A manhole will be set over the force main at the valved tee to provide a sump for the wastewater to be drained into.

F. Thrust Blocking. Location of thrust blocking will be shown on plans. Thrust block concrete will be Class B, 3,000 psi, poured against undisturbed earth. A plastic barrier will be placed between all thrust blocks and fittings.

See Standard Drawings 4-13 and 4-14. Restraining joint systems may be allowed in lieu of thrust blocking when designed by a licensed engineer and approved by the public works department or designated consultant. Restraining joint brand, type, and size will be specified on the plans.

G. Force Main Termination. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) odors and the buildup of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) occur in the operation of a force main. To mitigate these conditions, some type of control method(s) will be used. This may include chemical addition at the pump station and/or the re-aeration of the wastewater at or near the terminus. The means of re-aeration will be approved by the public works department or designated consultant.

The outfall manhole (point of connection where force main discharges into gravity sewer) and the next downstream manhole on the gravity sewer will be protected against corrosion. The means of protection will be approved by the public works department or designated consultant and may include spray-on coatings and PVC linings. If a PVC lining is used, it will be cast into the wall and floor of the manhole. No exposed concrete will be permitted.

H. Pigging Ports.

1. A pipeline pig is a projectile that is forced through the inside of a pipe to clean pressure pipeline. A pigging port is used as a point to send or retrieve the pig. Pigging ports will be located outside of paved areas but within the right-of-way as shown in Standard Drawing 5-15.

2. Pigging ports may be required:

a. At a change in pipeline size;

b. At the end of a dead-end line;

c. No farther apart than every 3,000 feet.

These locations are subject to review and approval by the public works department. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 785B § 14 (5D), 2005.]


12.04.610 STEP system.

A. General. A septic tank effluent pump (STEP) system is a facility consisting of a tank or tanks for settling and digesting wastewater solids, and a pressure piping system for conveying the supernatant liquid into the sewer system. Only sanitary wastewater will be discharged into the tank. Roof drains and other storm water sources will be strictly excluded. A STEP system may be installed to serve residential locations where approved by the city. A proposed site plan is required for each STEP system. Any new single-family subdivision designed with STEP sewers will include an easement on the face of the plat for access to all lots.

Operation and maintenance of the public portion of the STEP system will be the responsibility of the city only after the system has been inspected and approved and an easement is granted to the city and the warranty period of one year has expired. The public portion of the STEP system is defined as the STEP main and other components that are common or shared by all customers connected to the system as well as those portions of the individual service lines located under city streets and curbs. Operation and maintenance of the tank, pump, pump controls, and service lines located outside of city streets will be the responsibility of the property owner.

All STEP system customers are required to pump their tank(s) and have the pump system inspected every four years, unless conditions dictate a more frequent schedule. The inspection is to be conducted by a licensed plumbing contractor qualified to perform such work. The customer will provide the city with proof of having the pumping and inspection work accomplished. The city will maintain the records of the pumping and inspection work for each STEP customer on the city sewer system. If a STEP customer fails to have the scheduled pumping and inspection conducted, the city may elect to have the work performed. All costs associated with this work will be billed to the customer through their regular utility bill.

Power will be provided and paid for by the STEP customer. The customer will be responsible for taking corrective actions in a timely manner whenever an alarm is activated or maintenance and repairs become necessary. All sewer piping, drains, and plumbing between the street curb or edge of pavement and the building being served will be the responsibility of the customer. The customer will be responsible to curtail water usage during times of STEP system malfunction until such problems are corrected. The city will not accept responsibility for damages resulting from plumbing backups or other problems associated with STEP system facilities or plumbing that the customer is responsible for.

Currently, only the Orenco STEP pump system shown in Standard Drawing 5-7 has been approved by the city of Chehalis. However, other suppliers of STEP system components will be considered if equal to the Orenco product. The specifications must be submitted to the public works department and the engineering division for review and approval prior to inclusion with a proposed STEP system.

The outfall manhole where the STEP system main discharges into the gravity sewer and the next downstream manhole will be lined to protect them against corrosion. The means of protection will be approved by the public works department and the engineering division and may include spray-on coatings and PVC linings. If a PVC lining is used, it will be cast into the wall and floor of the manhole. No exposed concrete will be permitted.

B. Design Standards. The design of any STEP sewer system will conform to city standards and any applicable standards as set forth in CMC 12.04.070 and 12.04.160.

The layout of extensions will provide for the future continuation of the existing system as determined by the city. In addition, STEP mains will be extended to and through the side of the affected property fronting the main. Individual service boxes will be located at or near the center of each lot, at least 10 feet from a city water meter.

Pump and pipeline sizing will conform to the criteria as set forth in the most recent version of the Chehalis general sewer plan. Also, the applicable general notes in CMC 12.04.570 will be included on any plans dealing with STEP system design.

C. Pipe.

1. Mainline. The minimum pipe size used is two-inch inside diameter. This is based on maintenance requirements rather than flow. Pipe will be PVC Class 200, ASTM D2241 SDR 21 with rubber gasket joints. Gaskets will comply with ASTM D1869. STEP mains will have a minimum 36 inches of cover to top of pipe. See CMC 12.04.570(C) for sanitary sewer/water main crossing requirements.

2. Service Line. Service connection pipe will be minimum one-inch diameter, Schedule 80 PVC water pipe, solvent welded connection located at 90 degrees to the mainline, when possible. Solvent cements and primer for joining PVC pipe and fittings will comply with ASTM D2564 and will be used as recommended by the pipe and fitting manufacturers.

Services will have a minimum 24 inches of cover over the top of the pipe. Pressure services crossing over any water line will follow DOE requirements.

3. Building Sewer. The gravity building sewer between the building and the tank will be designed and installed in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code as adopted in the Chehalis Municipal Code.

4. All pipe will be installed with continuous tracer tape set 12 to 18 inches under the proposed finished grade. The marker tape will be marked “SEWER” and will be plastic, nonbiodegradable, metal core, or backing that can be detected by a standard metal detector. Tape will be Terra Tape “D” or approved equal. In addition to tracer tape, 14-gauge coated copper wire will be wrapped around the pipe, and then brought up and tied off at the valve boxes.

A one-pound magnesium anode will be buried with the sewer line every 1,000 linear feet for cathodic protection of the wire. Toning wire splices and connections to anodes will join wires both mechanically and electrically and will employ epoxy resin or heat shrink tape insulation. Furnishing and installing the tracer wire and anodes will be incidental to pipe installation.

D. Fittings. All pipe fittings will have a minimum working pressure rating equal to the pipe to which they are connected. Fittings will be PVC 1120, rubber joint complying with ASTM D-1784, D-2466, or D-2467, for pipe larger than one inch. Solvent weld fittings for one-inch pipe will be socket type Schedule 40 and will comply with ASTM D-1784 and ASTM D-2466.

E. Valves.

1. Ball and Gate Valves. All one-inch valves will be PVC ball valves with preloaded EPDM stem seals, microfinished PVC ball and self-adjusting polyethylene ball seat to compensate for wear and prevent overtightening. Valves will be designed for use with corrosive fluids, for low torque manual operation, and for a working pressure of 150 psi. All one-inch valves will be LT-1000-S as manufactured by KBI (King Brothers Industries) or GF500 as manufactured by George Fisher Signet, Inc.

All two-inch and larger valves will be resilient wedge gate M&H Style 820 or Waterous Series 500 plug valves with an epoxy coating to resist corrosion. A ball or gate valve will be located at every intersection and at a maximum of every 500 feet. Valves may be installed in conjunction with required pigging ports.

2. Air/Vacuum Valves. Air release and air/vacuum valves will be located at the high points of the line. Profiles for each pipe run will be submitted with the hydraulic gradeline for both static and dynamic flow conditions to show where the critical points are for air release valves. Vehicular access to air/vacuum valves is required for maintenance.

Because the air released by these valves will contain hydrogen sulfide, the valves and their enclosures have to be constructed of corrosion-resistant materials. The valve vaults will also have insulated lids to prevent freezing. The air released from the valve will be quite odoriferous, thus, each vent will be equipped with an odor control system such as activated carbon filters impregnated with sodium hydroxide.

3. Check Valves. Check valves used on service lines will be a tee or wye pattern swing check, PVC. It will have a working pressure of 150 psi. Valves will be designed for use with corrosive fluids. A check valve will be installed at the end of the service stub-out at the property line to be installed in a valve box located at or near the center of the lot at least 10 feet from any water meter. Check valves will be King Brothers Industries, KSC or approved equal.

4. Pressure-Sustaining Valve Assembly. Pressure-sustaining valves are sometimes required in the design of STEP systems to keep the pipeline full during periods of low or no flow or when siphoning conditions exist.

The pressure-sustaining valve will maintain inlet pressure at a preestablished set point, as determined by the city. It will open as pressure starts to increase above the set point and close as pressure falls below the set point. In the open position, flow will enter the valve in a direction axial to the pipe, turn radially outward through a slotted grillwork, and then inward to the former inlet axial direction. The valve will be constructed of two parts: a 316 stainless steel body and an elastometric liner or control element. The valve will be roll seal valve as manufactured by the Roll Seal Valve Company, Inc., or approved equal.

8. Concrete material and construction will meet the requirements of Section 6-02 of the most recent edition of WSDOT/APWA Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction.

9. Walls, bottom and top of reinforced-concrete tanks will be designed across the shortest dimension using one-way slab analysis. Stresses in each face of monolithically constructed tanks may be determined by analyzing the tank cross-section as a continuous fixed frame. The walls and bottom slab will be poured monolithically. Concrete will achieve a minimum 28-day compressive strength of 5,000 psi. The concrete mix will not be modified unless the mix design is reviewed and approved by the city.

10. Reinforcing steel will be ASTM A-615, Grade 60, fy = 60,000 psi. Details and placement will be in accordance with ACI 315 and ACI 318.

11. Tanks will be protected, by applying a heavy cement-base waterproof coating, Thoroseal or equal, on both the inside and outside surfaces.

12. Tanks will be manufactured and furnished with 18-inch diameter access openings of the size and configuration shown on the standard drawings. Modification of completed or existing tanks will not be permitted for structural, warranty, and liability reasons. Tanks will be furnished without concrete access hole lids. In order to demonstrate watertightness, tanks will be tested prior to acceptance. Each tank will be tested at the factory by filling with water to the base of the riser and letting it stand. After 24 hours the tank will be refilled to the soffit and the exfiltration rate will be determined by measuring the water loss during the next two hours. The two-hour water loss will not exceed one gallon.

13. The tank will not be moved from the manufacturing site to the job site until it has cured for seven days and has reached two-thirds of the design strength.

14. Tanks will be bedded on six inches of sand or pea gravel. Sides will be compacted in two-foot lifts to the same or greater density than the surrounding area.

15. After the tanks have been set in place and the riser installed, but prior to backfilling, each tank will be tested by filling the tank to two inches above the base of the riser for a two-hour period. Water loss will not exceed one gallon.

16. Tanks installed where ground water levels are above tank bottom require precautions to prevent flotation. In general, tanks will immediately be filled with water and will not be pumped down more than three feet below top.

17. Tank excavation will be backfilled with select material free of boulders and compacted to a dry density equal to or greater than that of the adjacent, undisturbed soil. Finish grading, cleanup, and restoration will be completed prior to final acceptance by the city.

H. Tank Riser.

2. A lid will be furnished with each riser. It will be a latching type and will be constructed of fiberglass with an aggregate finish. Riser and lid combination will be able to support a 2,500-pound wheel load. This does not imply that PVC risers are intended for traffic areas. All valves and unions will be no more than 12 inches deep in riser.

3. Each riser will be bonded to the top of the concrete tank with a two-part epoxy that will be supplied with the riser by the manufacturer. The epoxy will be applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. A generous bead of epoxy will be laid completely around the bottom of the tank. After the riser is in place, a generous fillet will be run completely around the inside base. The epoxy will be allowed a minimum of four hours’ curing time at 64 degrees Fahrenheit; otherwise a greater time will be required based on the manufacturer’s recommendations before backfill is placed over tank. Epoxy will be placed in an adequate amount to properly bond with the riser components. Care will be exercised during the curing period to avoid dislodging the riser or disrupting the watertight seal between the riser and tank.

I. Pumping Equipment.

12.04.620 Grease trap/grease interceptor.

A. General. Acceptable grease traps or grease interceptors will be required for all restaurants, commercial kitchens, industrial processing facilities or other facilities where fats, oils or grease (FOG) could be otherwise discharged to the sanitary sewer system. Such equipment will be operated and/or maintained by the owner or operator of such facilities so as to eliminate the discharge of these substances to the sanitary sewer system. Grease traps and interceptors will be designed in accordance with the most recent edition of the Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) as well as these standards.

Grease traps and grease interceptors are placed on “gray” water drain lines from fixtures that discharge high concentration levels of FOG. They are generally installed on premises that have kitchens and/or food preparation facilities for large numbers of people. These facilities include restaurants/food services, hotels/motels, schools, and institutions.

The purpose of a grease trap or a grease interceptor is to provide a place for the wastewater to reach a semiquiescent state and cool sufficiently, allowing the liquefied FOG to solidify and be retained through separation before the wastewater reaches the sanitary sewer system. The retained FOG is regularly cleaned and/or pumped out. The maintenance frequency varies with each facility and will be established by a representative from the wastewater division.

1. Grease Trap. A grease trap is a device designed to retain FOG from a source of up to four fixtures. Grease traps are usually located near the fixtures being served, inside the facility. The connection of dishwashers to grease traps will be avoided when practical. The maximum liquid temperature through a grease trap will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit. A dump valve may be required to ensure the liquid temperature standard is maintained, at the discretion of the public works department.

All grease traps will be regularly maintained by the customer at a frequency as determined by the facility characteristics. A maintenance log will be kept on site for recording of all maintenance activity. At a minimum, the log will contain date of maintenance and/or inspection, work performed, and name of individual who performed service.

2. Grease Interceptor. A grease interceptor consists of a tank with a minimum liquid volume of 750 gallons and serves multiple fixtures of a facility. Grease interceptors are generally located outside the facility they serve and are buried underground.

Interceptors will be watertight and constructed of materials not subject to excessive corrosion. Appropriate tank materials include concrete, coated metal, and fiberglass.

Plans for grease interceptors will include dimensions, structural reinforcing, structural calculations, and other pertinent data as determined by the public works department. Interceptors will be designed by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington.

B. Location. Grease traps and interceptors will be located in such a manner as to be easily accessible for cleaning, pumping, and sampling. In addition, they will be as close as practical to the fixtures discharging into them. In general, an appropriate location is under a kitchen sink (for traps) or immediately outside the facility served (for interceptors).

C. Design. The following considerations will be factored into the design of a grease trap or interceptor:

1. Capacity of the trap or interceptor;

2. Appropriate baffling at both the inlet and outlet;

3. Accessibility for cleaning and maintenance;

4. Isolation from insects, rodents, and pests;

5. Sufficient liquid travel time between inlet and outlet to ensure separation of the FOG prior to discharge from the unit;

6. Flow control fittings will be installed on the inlet side of smaller traps to protect against overloading and surges from the fixtures;

7. Venting of outdoor interceptors is not required where siphoning of the contents is prevented by providing appropriately sized outlets.

D. Capacity.

1. Grease Interceptor. The size of a grease interceptor will be determined by using the following formula:

MPH x WR x RT x SF = Vol

MPH = number of meals served per peak hour, or seating capacity (whichever is applicable)

WR = cumulative waste flow rate, based on the fixtures

– With dishwasher = six gallons

– Without dishwasher = five gallons

– Single-service kitchen (i.e., no reusable dishes or flatware) = two gallons

– Garbage disposal = one gallon

RT = retention times

– Commercial kitchen = two and one-half hours

– Single-service kitchen = one and one-half hours

SF = storage factor

– Eight-hour operation = one

– Single-service kitchen = one and one-half

– Sixteen-hour operation = two

– Twenty-four-hour operation = three

Vol = minimum interceptor liquid volume in gallons

2. Grease Trap. The capacity of a grease trap will be determined by using the following table:

	Number of Fixtures	Required Flow Rate (gpm)	Grease Retention (lbs.)

	1	20	40

	2	25	50

	3	35	70

	4	50	100

[Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]


12.32.060 Public hearing – Criteria for granting vacation.

At the time appointed for the hearing of the petition or resolution, or at such time as the same may be adjourned to by the council, the matter shall be considered and persons desiring to speak for or against the vacation shall be heard. Following such hearing, the council shall determine, among other things, the following:

A. That the vacation will provide a public benefit, and/or will be for a public purpose;

B. That the right-of-way vacation shall not adversely affect the street pattern or circulation of the immediate area or the community as a whole;

C. That the public need shall not be adversely affected;

D. That the right-of-way is not contemplated or needed for future public use, including utility routing or park or pedestrian/bike access;

E. That no abutting owner becomes landlocked or his access will not be substantially impaired, i.e., there must be an alternative mode of ingress and egress by way of a city street or alley, even if less convenient; and

F. That vacation of right-of-way shall not be in violation of RCW 35.79.035. [Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]


12.32.080 Ordinance granting vacation.

If there are no objections by owners of real estate abutting on the portion of street or alley to be vacated, sufficient to divest the council of jurisdiction, and if the council deems that such vacation shall be to the public’s interest and advantage, the council shall authorize by ordinance the vacation of such street or alley or part thereof, subject to the provisions of this chapter regarding payment of compensation and appraisal fees. Such ordinance may provide for the retention by the city of an easement or the right to exercise and grant easements in respect to the vacated land for the construction, repair and maintenance of public utilities, facilities and services; provided, that the city council may also, if no vested rights are impaired, modified or changed, impose such other conditions or limitations to the granting of the petition for vacation as it deems necessary and proper to preserve any desired public use or benefit. [Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]


12.32.090 Vacation of portion of area described in original petition.

If, after a hearing, the council determines that the petition cannot be granted in whole, but that a vacation of a portion of the area described in the original petition should be vacated, then the council may order that the portion be vacated. [Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]


12.32.100 Compensation and appraisal fees.

Following council’s determination that the petitioned right-of-way, or a portion thereof, should be vacated, the director of public works, or the director’s designee, with the assistance of the property owner(s), shall estimate the approximate value of the right-of-way to be vacated in the following manner:

A. Any vacation request shall have an appraisal done to determine the fair market value of the proposed vacation site. The appraisal value shall be determined upon an appraisal performed at the expense of the petitioner(s) to determine the value of the land; provided, however, said appraiser shall be approved by the city.

B. The vacationing party shall compensate the city in an amount which does not exceed one-half the appraised value of the area so vacated. If the street or alley has been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, or if the subject property or portions thereof were acquired at public expense, the city may require the owners of the abutting property owners of the street or alley to compensate the city in an amount that does not exceed the full appraised value of the area vacated.

C. Where the city elects to reserve a utility easement over all or a portion of a right-of-way being vacated, either the petitioner(s) shall pay 10 percent of the appraised value.

D. The city reserves the right to reject any appraisal which the city feels does not adequately reflect land value. It will be the city’s responsibility thereafter to establish the value of the land being considered for vacation.

After value has been determined, the city clerk shall notify the petitioner(s) of the amount of compensation to be paid for the vacated property. The compensation amount shall be paid to the city clerk within 90 days of the date the city council passes the vacation ordinance. Upon such payment, the ordinance shall be published as provided by law. [Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]


12.32.110 Assurance that petitioner meets conditions of vacation.

In all cases where the payment of compensation by petitioners is required, the vacation ordinance shall not take effect until such time as compensation has been paid. In order to ensure payment, the street vacation ordinance, were passed, shall direct the city clerk not to publish the ordinance until payment has been verified, and in the event such payment has not been received within 90 days of the city council’s adoption of said ordinance, the ordinance shall be null and void. [Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]


12.32.120 Property trade in lieu of payment.

In lieu of payment of monetary compensation, the petitions may grant or dedicate to the city for street or other municipal purposes real property useful for that purpose where the property to be acquired by such exchange has a fair market value at least equal to the amount of cash compensation that would otherwise be required. The city shall not be obligated to accept such an exchange and the decision of the city council on the acceptability of the alternate property offered shall be final. [Ord. 926B § 1, 2014.]

1. Right-of-way use permits may be issued for use of rights-of-way for activities that will alter the appearance of or disturb the surface, supersurface, or subsurface of the right-of-way on a temporary or permanent basis. The responsibility for adoption of policies relating to issuance, control, regulation, and enforcement of “disturbance” right-of-way use permits is vested with the public works director.

2. Disturbance of city right-of-way use permits may be for either single uses or multiple uses. Single-use permits will be issued to approved applicants who are planning a single activity or use at a single location in a short period of time. Multiple-use permits will be issued to approved applicants who are planning many activities or uses at several different locations in a short period of time.

3. Disturbance of city right-of-way use permits include, but are not limited to: boring, painting, culverts, sidewalks, curb cuts/driveways, street trenching, drainage facilities, landscaping, and utility installation.

B. Short-Term and Temporary Use of Right-of-Way.

1. Right-of-way use permits for short-term and temporary use of rights-of-way may be issued for activities that will not physically disturb or alter the right-of-way during such periods of time. The responsibility for adoption of policies relating to the issuance, control, regulation, and enforcement of short-term and temporary right-of-way use permits is vested with the city’s police services.

2. The use of rights-of-way for structures and activities that involve short-term and temporary uses requires this type of permit.

C. Certain applicants such as utilities and contractors may be involved in frequent use of the right-of-way for repair, maintenance, and construction in a short period of time. To avoid the issuance of a new permit for each use, the city may issue a permit for a period up to, but not exceeding, 90 days for multiple uses.

D. The city manager shall examine each right-of-way application submitted for review and approval to determine if it complies with the applicable provisions of this chapter and procedures adopted hereunder. If he finds that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter and procedures adopted hereunder, that the proposed use of such right-of-way will not unduly interfere with the rights and safety of the public, and if the application has not been disapproved by a jurisdiction with higher authority, he may approve the permit, and may impose such conditions thereon as are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and safety, and to mitigate any impacts resulting from the use.

E. All applications for right-of-way use permits should be submitted 15 business days or more before the planned need for the permit, to allow for adequate review time.

12.64.010 Definition of terms.

For the purpose of this chapter, the terms listed in this section are defined as follows:

“Capacity” or “capacity of an intersection or street” means the maximum practical volume that can be accommodated by that intersection or street section. When considering improvements, “capacity” refers to the capacity of the future or improved street/intersection.

“Developer” means any person, firm, partnership, corporation, property owner, or any other entity that is proposing, planning, undertaking, or responsible for commercial, industrial, or residential project development.

“Frontage or contiguous improvements” means street extensions or specific improvements within the existing or proposed right-of-way located close or adjacent to development or proposed development. Such improvements may primarily or entirely benefit or serve the development, or may be desired by the development.

“Future traffic target year” means an established year or horizon in the future for which project-generated traffic will be calculated and used in determining a development’s impacts on intersections or traffic locations.

“Level of service (LOS)” means an established service level for a street, intersection, or transportation system component that relates the acceptable level of conditions (such as traffic volumes, delay times, congestion).

“Mitigation fee” means a fee reflecting the shared cost of specific mitigation improvements identified by a development project proponent’s traffic study, related to the impacts associated with such improvements, required when a particular development project crosses a certain threshold of impact.

“Off-site improvements” means street or traffic improvements or improvement projects at or proposed to be at streets, intersections, or locations that are remote or nonadjacent to a development or proposed development.

“Participation threshold” means the lowest level of measurable traffic impact caused by a developer that triggers or requires participation in off-site street improvement project costs by the developer.

“Project cost” means the total cost for a transportation system improvement.

“Project-generated traffic” means traffic that is anticipated to be generated by a proposed new development and would use the street network around and in the vicinity of the development.

“Trip generation” means a method of measuring traffic impacts by counting the number of vehicle trips generated in and out of a particular development during a specific time frame. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.020 Participation in off-site improvements.

A. Participation in the costs of off-site improvements through the payment of a mitigation fee, as delineated in CMC 12.64.070, shall be required by developers and when the conditions listed below exist:

1. When it has been determined by the city that a development has caused a direct and identifiable traffic impact that meets or exceeds the participation threshold, provided in CMC 12.64.050, at a street or traffic location(s) and/or intersection(s) that are not fronting or contiguous to the development; and

2. Where an off-site traffic improvement(s) has been identified and included in the city’s capital facilities plan and/or six-year transportation improvement plan to address and/or mitigate impacts at the traffic location(s) and/or intersection(s) so impacted by the development, or where the off-site traffic improvement(s) has been installed within five years of the date the development is proposed, to address and/or mitigate impacts at the traffic location(s) and/or intersection(s) so impacted by the development.

B. Participation in the costs of off-site improvements through the payment of a mitigation fee, as delineated in CMC 12.64.070, shall be required by proposed developers when the conditions listed below exist:

1. When it has been determined by the city that a proposed development will cause a direct and identifiable traffic impact that meets or exceeds the participation threshold, provided in CMC 12.64.050, at street or traffic locations and/or intersections that are not fronting or contiguous to the proposed development; and

2. Where an off-site traffic improvement(s) has been identified and included in the city’s capital facilities plan and/or six-year transportation improvement plan to address and/or mitigate impacts at the traffic location and/or intersection determined to be so impacted by the proposed development, or where an off-site traffic improvement(s) has been installed within five years of the date the development is proposed, to address and/or mitigate impacts at the traffic location(s) and/or intersection(s) determined to be so impacted by the proposed development. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.030 Trip generation study.

A. After a developer has submitted an application and/or proposal for a development project, the public works director and the city’s development review committee (DRC) shall separately review the project in accordance with established development criteria and development engineering standards to determine if a traffic impact analysis shall be required. If either the director or the DRC determines that a traffic analysis is required, the developer shall cause a traffic impact analysis to be conducted in accordance with the directions from the director.

B. One of the components required to be included in the traffic impact analysis shall be a trip generation study. Even if it is determined that a traffic impact analysis shall not be required, the director may require the developer to have a trip generation study conducted. Said trip generation studies shall be conducted by a traffic engineer or a traffic consultant determined to be qualified by the director. Trip generation studies shall be performed under the direction of the director in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and established development guidelines and development engineering standards.

C. Trip generation studies shall be used to forecast project-generated traffic for an established future horizon. This future horizon shall be the future traffic target year as provided in CMC 12.64.060. Such trip generation studies shall be conducted by a traffic engineer or a traffic consultant determined to be qualified by the director. Residential developments shall consider the number of dwelling units, and commercial, retail, and/or industrial development shall consider the number of square feet of gross leasable area or building area. The director may consider discounting the trip generation to account for traffic that is already on the adjacent roadway network and/or trips that are linked with other activities.

D. The developer shall be responsible for all costs associated with the traffic impact analysis and/or trip generation study. The developer shall submit a copy of the traffic impact analysis and/or trip generation study to the director for his review and acceptance prior to using the results to evaluate and/or determine levels of participation required for off-site improvements. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.040 Method for determining capacity and project-generated traffic.

For the purposes of this chapter and in conducting traffic impact analyses, trip generation studies, and calculating developer’s participation in off-site improvements, the method for determining capacity shall be as described in the most current version of the Transportation Research Board Highway Capacity Manual, and the method for determining project-generated traffic volumes shall be as forecasted using the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.050 Participation threshold.

A. For the purposes of this chapter, the city shall establish a participation threshold of 10 trips per peak hour. This 10 trips per peak hour threshold sets the minimum level requiring participation in off-site street improvement project costs.

B. As part of the developer’s traffic impact analysis and/or trip generation study, intersections and traffic locations shall be identified where there will be, or are, 10 or more new peak hour, project-generated trips. If and when an improvement is warranted, then a computation of its pro rata share of the costs can be computed. Any development that does not generate 10 or more new peak hour trips at a particular location shall not be required to participate or share in the costs for any planned or implemented off-site street improvement project at that particular location. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.060 Future traffic target year.

A. Unless the city specifically authorizes another future horizon year for a development, the initial target year, for determining future traffic, shall be five years after the development has been occupied, or in full operation, for 12 months.

B. Any developer desiring to petition the city to authorize and establish another future horizon must submit his petition in writing to the public works director, along with any justification or information supporting his petition for another initial target year. The director will then review the petition to determine if there is justification for another target year. The director will decide upon such written petition within 10 days.

C. Any developer who disputes or disagrees with the initial target year for determining future traffic, or is not satisfied with the decision of the director, may appeal the decision by formally petitioning the city council at a regular city council meeting. The city council may uphold the previous decision, or may concur with the appeal, or may modify or amend the initial target year for determining future traffic to another future horizon, or may make a decision based upon other factors. The decision of the city council will be considered final. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.070 Formula for calculating mitigation fee.

The formula for calculating a developer’s mitigation fee or proportional share of an off-site street improvement shall be derived by dividing the project-generated traffic by the future traffic with the project. In order to determine the developer’s pro rata costs of an off-site street improvement, this value shall be multiplied by the project costs. Mathematically this formula is written as follows:

Project-Generated Traffic/Future Traffic with the Project x Project Cost = Developer’s Mitigation Fee. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.080 Frontage or contiguous improvements.

Unless other provisions are specifically made, a developer proposing “frontage or contiguous improvements” shall be fully responsible for any and all costs associated with frontage or contiguous improvements. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.090 Voluntary installation of improvements.

A. When a street or traffic improvement or improvements, that are not included in the city’s capital facilities plan and/or six-year transportation improvement plan, are desired by the developer or are identified by the developer’s traffic impact analysis (TIA) or by the city as being necessary in order to accommodate or required to mitigate impacts of said development, the developer may volunteer to be fully responsible for any and all costs associated with such improvements.

B. When a street or traffic improvement or improvements, that are included in the city’s capital facilities plan and/or six-year transportation plan but scheduled to be installed or implemented at some date in the future, are desired by the developer or are identified by the developer’s traffic impact analysis (TIA) or by the city as being necessary in order to accommodate or required to mitigate impacts of said development, the developer may volunteer to be fully responsible for any and all costs associated with such improvements rather than postpone or delay the development until after such scheduled improvements are installed.

C. When traffic impact(s) associated with a development cause a degradation of an established level of service standard for a street location or intersection where there is no planned traffic improvement included in the city’s capital facilities plan and/or six-year transportation plan, the developer may volunteer to be fully responsible for the installation of any traffic improvement(s) required to maintain or restore the established level of service, in order to accommodate his development, and the developer may also be responsible for any and all costs associated with such improvements rather than postpone or delay the development until after such improvements required to maintain or restore the established level of service may otherwise be installed. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.100 Latecomers fee.

A. At the request of developers and/or others who have paid for the costs of frontage or contiguous improvements, voluntarily installed improvements or other improvements desired by the developer, or other improvement voluntarily agreed to by the developer, the city may authorize and establish a latecomers fee agreement(s) to provide opportunities for developers to recoup a portion of such costs that relate to capacity used or planned to be used by subsequent development.

B. A developer seeking the establishment of a latecomers fee shall submit a written request to the city prior to or at the time the improvement, for which the latecomers fee is being requested, is being completed or accepted by the city. Such request shall identify cost and other information that justify the proposed latecomers fee amount(s) and formula(s). The city shall consider such requests, and may accept the latecomers fee as proposed or modify the amount and/or formula, and establish a latecomers fee agreement with the developer, or the city may deny the latecomer fee request, if it disagrees with the submitted justification. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.110 Posting of bonds.

A. When an off-site street improvement(s) is not scheduled to be installed for a few years, the city may allow a developer required to share in the costs of such improvement(s) to post a bond in the amount of the developer’s pro rata share of costs of such improvement(s).

B. Any developer desiring to post a bond with the city in the amount of his pro rata share of costs of such improvement(s) must submit his request in writing to the public works director, along with any justification or information supporting his request to post a bond rather than pay the costs for his pro rata share of such improvement(s). The director shall submit such request(s) to the city council, who will decide upon such request at a regularly scheduled city council meeting. The decision of the city council will be considered final. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]


12.64.120 LID waiver of protest.

When an off-site street improvement(s) is not scheduled to be installed for a few years and/or where such improvement(s) and its associated costs may not yet be fully identified and/or where it may be in the best interest of the city to have such improvement(s) installed or constructed and providing developer participation in such improvement(s) through the formation of a local improvement district (LID), the city council may elect to require developers to sign a waiver of protest for the formation of a local improvement district to provide for the funding of such improvement(s) in the future. [Ord. 579B, 1995.]

13.04.050 Maintenance or continuance of water capacity.

A. In order for any commercial and/or industrial customer served by the city water system to maintain capacity that has been previously allocated to said commercial and/or industrial customer, such customer must demonstrate use of water capacity that has been previously allocated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

B. If a commercial and/or industrial water customer has reduced its water usage as defined in this chapter, the city shall notify said commercial and/or industrial water customer in accordance with this section and reduce the amount of water capacity allocated to such commercial and/or industrial customer in accordance with this section.

C. In order for a commercial and/or industrial customer receiving service from the city water utility to maintain or hold water capacity as may have been previously allocated, such commercial and/or industrial customer must use a minimum of 80 percent of the total water capacity for at least four consecutive months in any 12-month period.

D. If any commercial and/or industrial customer fails to use 80 percent of the previously allocated capacity for four consecutive months in any 12-month period, the water capacity allocated to that commercial and/or industrial customer shall be determined as follows:

1. The lowest usage in the highest consecutive four-month period shall be 80 percent of the new allocated water capacity for any such commercial and/or industrial customer.

2. If the city reduces the allocation of water capacity from the quantity that was originally purchased from the city, the city shall refund that portion of the amount of actual capacity charges paid by the commercial and/or industrial customer that relates to the amount of capacity reduced.

E. In order for a commercial and/or industrial customer to maintain their allocation of water capacity, after it has been determined by the city that a reduction in their allocation of such capacity is warranted, said commercial and/or industrial customer shall pay a capacity maintenance charge per month in addition to their regular water use rate fees and charges. Such capacity maintenance charges shall be calculated by multiplying the number of ERUs of water capacity that the city has determined warrants reduction by the current minimum monthly service capital improvement charges for water.

F. During any three months in a 12-month period, if any commercial and/or industrial customer has been identified as using one ERU or greater of water capacity above the amount of capacity that has been allocated and if there is unallocated water capacity available, the city shall charge such commercial and/or industrial customer the current capacity costs or charges for such increased capacity. If there is no unallocated capacity available, the city shall instruct the commercial and/or industrial customer to reduce usage to the level of capacity that has been allocated. If said instructed commercial and/or industrial customer does not reduce water usage to the level of allocated capacity, the city shall take action(s) necessary to cause the capacity used to be reduced to the allocated level. Such action(s) may include imposing restrictions or limitations to such water service or disconnection of water service.

G. If capacity is available, the highest usage above the previously allocated capacity shall be the new allocated water capacity for any such commercial and/or industrial customer upon approval of the city council (if required) and upon payment of the associated water capacity charges.

H. The public works director shall conduct an initial evaluation of water use to determine allocated capacity of water for all existing commercial and/or industrial customers. On an annual basis the public works director shall review the water use for such commercial and/or industrial customers to identify such customers that have used less than or more than their allocated capacity.

I. If it is determined that the capacity allocated to any commercial and/or industrial customer warrants reduction in accordance with this section, the city shall provide written notice to said commercial and/or industrial customer indicating the city’s intention to adjust or reduce the water capacity allocation.

J. If it is determined that the capacity allocated to any commercial and/or industrial customer warrants an increase in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if it is determined that any commercial and/or industrial customer has used greater than the allocated capacity of water service, and such additional water service is unavailable, the city shall provide written notice to said commercial and/or industrial customer indicating the city’s intention to adjust or increase or restrict to the allocated capacity the water capacity allocation.

K. The notice shall provide a 30-day comment period prior to the implementation of any such adjustment or reduction of their capacity allocation. The public works director shall review and consider any comments received during this 30-day comment period prior to making a final determination on any such adjustment or reduction of their capacity allocation.

L. Should the public works director determine that the water capacity warrants being increased and should the city approve such increase, payment of the related capacity charges shall be due within 10 days of the date of the final determination notice. If such capacity charges are not paid within this 10-day period, the city shall take such action(s) necessary to cause the capacity used to be reduced to the previously allocated level. Such action(s) may include imposing restrictions or limitations to such water service or disconnection of water service. [Ord. 866B, 2011.]

13.08.110 Separate side sewer.

A separate and independent side sewer shall be provided for every building except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the side sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. Where, because of physical complications, the public works director finds that it may be necessary or beneficial to allow two adjacent buildings to connect to the public sewer through a common side sewer, such connection will be allowed; provided, that the common side sewer has a diameter of six inches or greater. Old side sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination or test by the public works director, to meet all requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.120 Additional requirements.

No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirement that may be imposed by the DOE, the county health department, or other authorized regulatory agency. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.130 Side sewer permit required. 

No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb the public sewer or appurtenance thereof, or engage in the construction of a side sewer, either on private property or within public right-of-way, without first obtaining a side sewer permit from the public works department, in which the specific purpose shall be delineated. A side sewer permit will be required for each individual structure to be connected. Application for a side sewer permit, for the purpose of making connection to, or opening into, altering or disturbing the public sewer or appurtenance thereof, or engaging in the construction of a side sewer, shall be made by the owner of the property to be serviced, or a qualified plumbing contractor licensed and bonded by the State of Washington Department of Labor and Industries. No licensed plumbing contractor shall do any side sewer work under any other person’s side sewer permit, nor shall any unauthorized person do any side sewer work under a side sewer permit applied for and issued to a licensed plumbing contractor or the owner of the property where such side sewer work is to be performed except as may be otherwise authorized by the public works director. The issuance of a side sewer permit by the city shall not relieve the permit holder from the responsibility of obtaining other such permits or licenses as may be required by the city, the county, or other jurisdictions in which the side sewer is installed. Permit holders shall contact other utilities for location of their facilities before starting excavation. When a side sewer is to be installed across the private property of another person, the applicant requesting the side sewer permit must show proof that a duly executed easement has been obtained from other such property owner and officially recorded. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.140 Sewer and side sewer construction.

All sewers and side sewers shall be constructed and installed in accordance with the provisions of the engineering development code as adopted by the city council. All work shall require approval and acceptance by the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011; Ord. 819B § 13, 2007.]


13.08.150 Side sewer pipe materials.

A. Pipes acceptable for side sewers shall be as follows:

1. Cast iron soil pipe – Federal Specification WWP-401;

2. Ductile pipe – ANSI A21.51 Thickness Class 51;

3. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) – ASTM D3034 with SDR Equals 35.

B. The public works director shall consider any proposed sewer pipe other than those specifically set forth to determine its acceptability for use. Until a final determination allowing the use of such pipe has been made, no pipe other than those listed shall be used for side sewers to be connected to the sanitary sewer system of the city.

C. Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least 10 feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of 10 feet, a sewer may be laid closer than 10 feet to a water main if the sewer is constructed of cast iron or ductile iron with watertight joints, and:

1. It is laid in a separate trench.

2. It is laid in the same trench with the water main located at one side on a bench of undisturbed earth.

3. In either case, the elevation of the crown of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the invert of the water main. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.160 Side sewer pipe joints.

All joints and connections shall be gastight and watertight, as determined by the testing and inspection procedures outlined in this chapter. Plumbing joints for PVC pipe shall be rubber-gasketed type conforming to ASTM D3212. Joints for ductile iron pipe shall be push-on type or mechanical joint conforming to ANSI A21.11. Pipe and jointing shall be installed in accordance with the instructions furnished by the pipe manufacturer and approved by the public works director. Other jointing materials and methods may be used only with the approval of the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.170 Side sewer fittings and cleanouts.

A. The side sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight horizontal alignment insofar as possible. Changes in horizontal alignment shall be made only with wye branches, bends, or a combination of wye branch and bend. All changes of horizontal alignment 45 degrees or greater shall be made with a wye branch and bends as required, with the straight through opening plugged for use as a cleanout. No 90-degree bend shall be allowed. Two bends may be allowed between cleanouts, provided the distance between cleanouts does not exceed 20 feet. A cleanout shall be installed between 30 inches and 36 inches of all buildings unless written permission to omit or change the location of such cleanout has been obtained from the public works director. Additional cleanouts, including those used for commercial and industrial properties, shall be installed in locations designated by the public works director, but in no case shall the distance between cleanouts exceed 100 feet. Suitable frames and covers of a type designated by the public works director shall be used for all cleanouts on commercial or industrial property and in paved areas, and such frames shall be cast in a concrete block 30 inches by 30 inches by eight inches flush with the final paving. All cleanouts not in paved areas shall extend to within 18 inches of the ground surface. All cleanouts shall be plugged with plugs, using the standard compression joint of the pipe being used, to prevent entry of dirt, roots, ground water or surface water, and shall be secured against back pressure.

B. A test tee shall be provided at the point of connection to the public sewer and at any other required point or points to ensure that all portions of the side sewers can be tested. It shall be the responsibility of the permit holder to install all risers, cleanouts, casting, concrete blocks, etc., required before the side sewer will be approved by the city. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.180 Connections to public sewer.

The connection of the side sewer into the public sewer shall be made at a wye or tee branch, if such a branch is available in a suitable location. Connections at other than an existing wye or tee shall be made only by a qualified plumbing contractor that is licensed and bonded, and has been approved by the public works director, and all cost for such connections shall be the responsibility of the permit holder or owner. If the joint type or dimensions of wye or tee in the public sewer are different than that of the side sewer pipe, a transition adaptor approved by the public works director shall be used to connect the side sewer to the wye or tee. If a suitable transition is not obtainable, the method of making the connection shall be approved by the public works director. Connection to the building drain pipe shall be made by means of a flexible clamp-type coupling or other approved methods. The first length of pipe installed at the wye or tee shall not be more than two feet long. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.190 Size of side sewer pipe.

Side sewers shall be no less than four inches in diameter. If more than one occupied building is attached to the same side sewer or building sewer as allowed in CMC 13.08.110, Separate side sewer, the diameter of the side sewer shall not be less than six inches. Side sewers to multiple structures, commercial establishments, or industrial buildings shall not be less than six inches in diameter. Where the possibility exists for additional connections to be made to a side sewer, the public works director may require that the side sewer be eight inches in diameter or larger. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.200 Slope of side sewer.

All side sewers shall be laid on a uniform slope of not less than one-fourth inch per foot, wherever possible. Where it is impossible or impractical to obtain a one-fourth-inch-per-foot slope due to the depth of the public sewer or to the structural features or arrangements of the building, a lesser slope is permissible, when approved by the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.210 Mechanical lifting devices required.

A. In any building, structure, or premises in which the elevation of plumbing fixtures is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer or to achieve the minimum slope requirement, the sewage shall be lifted and discharged to the public sewer by approved ejectors, pumps, or other equally efficient, approved mechanical devices.

B. When only the lower floor(s) of a structure is too low for gravity flow, the remaining floors must flow by gravity. The discharge line from said ejectors, pumps, or other mechanical devices shall be provided with an accessible backwater valve and gate valve; the discharge line shall connect to the gravity side sewer at the crown of the side sewer through a wye fitting. When, in the opinion of the public works director, there is a possibility of backup in the side sewer from head pressure in the public sewer, minimum elevations may be prescribed by which gravity flow may be obtained and flow from any building drain lower than that prescribed by the public works director for protection against flooding, a backwater valve shall be installed at the owner’s expense. Effective operation of any backwater valve and/or any mechanical device to lift sewage and wastes shall be the responsibility of the owner or operator of the building.

C. The city shall not be held liable for any damage or injury sustained from installation or operation of said backwater valve and/or mechanical lifting device.

D. All pump or mechanical lifting device installations must meet all pertinent building and plumbing codes, and must be approved by the public works director before installation. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.220 Excavation.

A. All excavation required for the installation of a side sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the public works director. The permit holder, before beginning excavation in a public area, shall have at the site sufficient barricades to properly protect the work. The barricades shall meet the requirements as listed in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

B. The permit holder shall comply with any additional city, county, state, or other jurisdictional laws, ordinances, and regulations relating to the safety and protection of the excavation. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.230 Laying of pipe.

When unsuitable bedding is found, as determined by the public works director, the side sewer trench shall be over-excavated and a bedding of sand or fine gravel a minimum of four inches deep shall be prepared. Gravel shall be three-quarter-inch maximum size. If the trench is unintentionally over-excavated, the bottom shall be brought up to proper grade using this same bedding material. All pipe shall be laid true to grade with the bell upgrade. Pipe shall be cradled in the prepared trench bottom. The bottom of the trench shall be smooth and free from large rocks that could injure the side sewer pipe. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.240 Testing.

A. It shall be the duty of the person installing the side sewer as authorized by the permit to notify the public works director orally or in writing that said side sewer is ready for inspection. A minimum of 48 hours is required after said notification before actual inspection may take place. No inspection will be made on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, or between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 8:30 a.m.

B. Side sewers shall be tested for their entire length from the public sewer by testing for visible leakage before backfilling by inserting a removable plumber’s plug at the connection of the side sewer to the public sewer and filling the line with water to a level of at least one foot above the top of the side sewer at its connection with the building drain. A test tee or tees as required in CMC 13.08.170, Side sewer fittings and cleanouts, shall be used for insertion of plug and shall be secured against back pressure upon completion of the test. A special fitting, provided by the permit holder, shall be inserted into the cleanout fitting at the connection to the building drain to provide a short standpipe to obtain a one-foot head at that point. The side sewer pipe shall be filled with water at least one hour before actual inspection, during which time it will be presumed that full absorption of the pipe body has taken place. The permit holder or the licensed plumbing contractor must be present at the job during the full duration of the inspection.

C. The rate of leakage in the building sewer shall not exceed the following amounts when measured by exfiltration:

1. Four-inch pipe – 0.015 gal./hr./lineal foot of side sewer;

2. Six-inch pipe – 0.02 gal./hr./lineal foot of side sewer. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.250 Side sewer inspection.

A. It shall be the duty of the holder of a permit to make sure that the work will pass inspection. If an additional inspection is necessary due to test failure, a charge of $15.00 shall be made for each additional inspection.

B. Notices of correction or violations shall be written by the public works director and may be posted at the site of the work or mailed or delivered to the permittee or his authorized representative. Refusal, failure, or neglect to comply with any such notice or order within 10 days after receipt thereof shall be considered a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties for violations set forth elsewhere in this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.260 Backfilling.

A. No backfill shall be placed over side sewer pipe until the work has been inspected and approved by the public works director. Any portion of the side sewer covered before inspection shall be uncovered by the owner at his own expense within two days after notice to do so has been issued by the public works director.

B. Trenches shall be carefully backfilled by tamping to a depth of six inches above the pipe to avoid damaging the pipe. All backfill between the public sewer and the property line shall be of material approved by the public works director, and be water-settled or mechanically tamped in six-inch layers to minimize settlement. Any settlement that occurs within 12 months after backfilling shall be corrected at the expense of the permit holder. Additional fill and surfacing materials as approved by the public works director shall be placed to restore the settled area to original grade.

C. A minimum of six inches of gravel surfacing shall be temporarily placed in the public right-of-way or traveled areas in commercial properties. Final surfacing equivalent to the adjoining undisturbed roadway shall not be placed until such time as, in the opinion of the public works director, final settlement has taken place.

D. All pipe installations shall be bedded and backfilled to conform to the pipe manufacturer’s specification and in accordance with American Public Works Association Standard Specifications.

E. Minimum cover for side sewer shall be 18 inches, except as hereafter provided:

1. Minimum cover for side sewers at the property line shall be four feet below the crest of the public way at said property line.

2. Minimum cover for side sewers crossing a ditch in the public way shall be two feet six inches.

F. Minimum cover restrictions shall not apply when the depth of the public sewer does not allow the minimum cover restrictions to be followed, providing that approval of the public works director has been obtained. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.270 Certain water not to be discharged into sewer.

No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any storm water, surface water, ground water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.280 Discharge of unpolluted drainage.

A. Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the public works director.

B. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged, upon approval of the public works director, to a storm sewer or natural outlet. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.290 Public sewer prohibitions and limitations.

Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the public sewers:

A. Any solids, liquids, or gases which may, by themselves or by interaction with other substances, cause fire or explosive hazards or in any way be injurious to persons, property, or the operation of the wastewater disposal works.

B. Any noxious or malodorous solids, liquids, or gases which either singularly or by interaction with other substances are capable of creating a public nuisance or hazard to life or preventing entry into sewers for maintenance or repair.

C. Any solids, gases, waxes, slurries, or viscous material of such caliber or in such quantity that, in the opinion of the public works director, may cause an obstruction to the flow in the sewer, or otherwise interfere with the proper functioning of the wastewater disposal works.

13.08.310 Industrial pretreatment requirements.

A. Intent. The intent of this section is to set forth uniform requirements for users of the city wastewater treatment plant. It shall enable the city to comply with state and federal laws that apply to wastewater treatment plants with SIUs, but without a discharge permit program. All actions required or authorities granted under this chapter are in accordance with the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.), the Federal Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403), and Chapter 90.48 RCW, Water Pollution Control. This section shall apply to all users of the wastewater treatment plant. The chapter defines certain prohibited discharges; sets forth local limits for use by state agencies in the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the recovery of liquidated damages and collection of penalties.

B. Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the public works director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the public works director may be delegated by the public works director to other city personnel.

C. Prohibited Discharge Standards.

1. General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the wastewater treatment plant any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the wastewater treatment plant whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements (40 CFR 403.5(a) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(i)).

2. Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the wastewater treatment plant the following pollutants in any form (solid, liquid, or gaseous):

a. Any pollutant which either alone or by interaction may create a fire or explosive hazard in the wastewater treatment plant, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21 (40 CFR 403.5(b)(1)), or are capable of creating a public nuisance (WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(ii)). This includes waste streams sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair. At no time shall a waste stream cause two successive readings on an explosion meter to be more than five percent nor any single reading over 10 percent of the LEL of the meter at any point in the collection system or treatment works.

b. Any pollutant which will cause corrosive structural damage to the wastewater treatment plant, but in no case discharges with a pH less than 5.0 or more than 11.0, or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, or personnel of the wastewater treatment plant, unless the system is specifically designed to accommodate such discharge and the discharge is authorized by an applicable wastewater discharge permit (40 CFR 403.5(b)(2) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(iv)).

c. Any solid or viscous substances including fats, oils, and greases in amounts which may cause obstruction to the flow in a wastewater treatment plant or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment plant (40 CFR 403.5(b)(3) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(iii)).

d. Any discharge of pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, is sufficient to cause interference with the wastewater treatment plant (40 CFR 403.5(b)(4) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(vi)).

e. Any waste stream having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, or cause worker health or safety problems in the collection system. In no case shall wastewater be discharged at a temperature which causes the temperature of the influent to the treatment plant to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) unless the system is specifically designed to accommodate such a discharge, and the discharge is authorized by an applicable wastewater discharge permit (40 CFR 403.5(b)(5) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(v)).

f. Any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through (40 CFR 403.5(b)(6) and WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(i)).

g. Any pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within any portion of the wastewater treatment plant in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems (40 CFR 403.5(b)(7) and WAC 173-216-060(b)(ii)).

h. Any trucked or hauled wastes, except at discharge points designated by the city and in compliance with all applicable city requirements and during specified hours (40 CFR 403.5(b)(8)).

i. Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair (WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(ii)).

j. Any of the following discharges unless approved by the DOE under extraordinary circumstances such as the lack of direct discharge alternatives due to combined sewer service or need to augment sewage flows due to septic conditions (WAC 173-216-060(2)(b)(vii)):

i. Noncontact cooling water in significant volumes;

ii. Storm water, and other direct inflow sources; or

iii. Wastewaters significantly affecting system hydraulic loading, which do not require treatment or would not be afforded a significant degree of treatment by the wastewater treatment plant.

k. Any dangerous or hazardous wastes as defined in Chapter 173-303 WAC, as amended, except as allowed in compliance with that regulation (WAC 173-216-060(1) and 40 CFR Part 261).

l. Any substance which will cause the wastewater treatment plant to violate its NPDES, state waste discharge or other disposal system permits or causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant’s effluent to fail a toxicity test.

m. Any substance which may cause the wastewater treatment plant’s effluent or treatment residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or would interfere with the reclamation process or cause the wastewater treatment plant to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed pursuant to the federal, state, or local statutes or regulations applicable to the sludge management method being used.

n. Any discharge which imparts color which cannot be removed by the wastewater treatment plant’s treatment process such as dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently impart color to the treatment plant’s effluent, thereby violating the city’s NPDES permit. Color (in combination with turbidity) shall not cause the treatment plant effluent to reduce the depth of the compensation point for photosynthetic activity in the receiving waters by more than 10 percent from the seasonably established norm for aquatic life.

o. Any discharge containing radioactive wastes or isotopes except as specifically approved by the public works director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations including WAC 246-221-190, Disposal by Release into Sanitary Sewerage Systems; and meeting the concentration limits of WAC 246-221-290, Appendix A, Table I, Column 2; and WAC 246-221-300, Appendix B.

p. Any sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes or from industrial processes.

q. Any medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the public works director.

r. Any detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances in amounts which may cause excessive foaming in the wastewater treatment plant.

s. Any incompatible substance such as: grease, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dusts, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes, or any other organic or inorganic matter greater than one-half inch in any dimension.

t. Persistent pesticides and/or pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).

u. Any wastewater which, in the opinion of the public works director, can cause harm either to the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment; have an adverse effect on the receiving stream; or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance, unless allowed under a legal and binding agreement by the public works director (except that no waiver may be given to any categorical pretreatment standard).

3. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the wastewater treatment plant.

D. Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National categorical pretreatment standards as adopted and hereafter amended by the EPA pursuant to the Act shall be met by all users in the regulated industrial categories. These standards, found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 – 471, are hereby incorporated by reference.

E. State Requirements.

1. State requirements and limitations on discharges to the wastewater treatment plant as incorporated into Washington State law by Chapter 90.48 RCW and implemented in Chapters 173-201A, 173-216 and 173-240 WAC shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter or other applicable ordinances. This includes the requirement to meet AKART as defined herein whenever applicable and more stringent than the limits of subsection (F) of this section, Local Limits, and to comply with the requirements of subsection (Q) of this section, Wastewater Discharge Permitting – Requirements for Discharge.

2. Any user determined by the city to qualify as an SIU shall file an application for a State Waste Discharge Permit with the DOE in accordance with the requirements of WAC 173-216-070. Proof of acceptance of the application and payment of permit fees shall be kept at the user’s facilities, and produced upon request by the city. Failure to submit the application or rejection of the application by the DOE may be considered sufficient grounds to terminate or refuse to provide sewer service.

F. Local Limits.

1. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum allowable discharge concentration limits. These limits apply to the total in all states and forms.

	Metals: 

	Arsenic	0.23 mg/L

	Cadmium	0.15 mg/L

	Chromium 	2.0 mg/L

	Copper	0.25 mg/L

	Cyanide	1.4 mg/L

	Zinc	1.4 mg/L

	Other Pollutants:

	FOG	100 mg/L

	BOD	300 mg/L

	TSS	300 mg/L

2. The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the city-owned sewer system or sewer collection system (end of the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are for “total” metal unless indicated otherwise. The DOE may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations above. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.

3. Based on the above-listed pollutant limits, the equivalent total mass of each pollutant which the wastewater treatment plant can accept per 40,000 gallons of wastewater flow discharged from industrial users to the wastewater treatment plant is established as listed below. These total mass limits apply to the total in all states and forms.

	Arsenic	35 grams/day

	Cadmium	22.6 grams/day

	Chromium	302 grams/day

	Copper	37 grams/day

	Cyanide	212 grams/day

	Lead	21 grams/day

	Mercury	0.05 grams/day

	Nickel	271 grams/day

	Selenium	30 grams/day

	Silver	23 grams/day

	Zinc	212 grams/day

4. The above pollutant limits shall immediately apply to all users discharging wastewater to the wastewater treatment plant and sewer system with the following exceptions:

a. Users discharging under permit prior to the implementation of this chapter shall be allowed a period up to five years to achieve compliance with the conditions of this chapter under the following conditions:

i. The user submits a schedule of compliance which will achieve compliance with this chapter within five years of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

ii. The city determines it is in the best interest of the community to authorize the discharge, and the discharge will not adversely impact the wastewater treatment plant, cause a violation of the city’s NPDES permit, or any other federal, state, or local regulation.

iii. The user is currently providing AKART as determined by the DOE, or the schedule of compliance achieves AKART in the shortest reasonable length of time as an interim step in achieving full compliance.

iv. The city and the DOE approve the compliance schedule in writing.

b. Users may be given credit to discharge additional pollutant loadings in exchange for removing an equal or greater amount of the same pollutant from other sources which discharge to the wastewater treatment plant and sewer system. These “pollutant credits” must be of such a nature that the amount of pollutants removed from the waste streams of other sources can be quantified and verified. The city may add these pollutant credits to the maximum pollutant mass or concentration loadings permitted without violating this chapter.

c. Users which are determined by the city to have no potential, either alone or in conjunction with other users, to violate any prohibited discharge standard (see subsection (C) of this section, Prohibited Discharge Standards) may be exempt from compliance with specific pollutant concentration limits. In such cases, these users will be subject only to implementing best management practices as determined by the city or the DOE. Such users cannot be SIUs or subject to categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. In such cases, the user shall be designated as an insignificant industrial user (IIU), and shall be listed as such in the city’s annual industrial user (IU) survey update.

These exceptions shall be immediately void if the discharge causes a violation of the city’s NPDES permit, or any other federal, state, or local regulation, or if compliance with any compliance schedule milestone is not achieved within 30 days of the established date, or if any compliance schedule extends beyond five years from the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. In such cases, the user shall be immediately responsible for compliance with the local limits in subsections (F)(1) and (F)(3) of this section.

G. City’s Right of Revision.

1. The city reserves the right to establish more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the wastewater treatment plant.

2. The city shall investigate any occurrence of pass through or interference of which it is made aware. Where pass through or interference has been caused because local limits do not exist for the pollutant, or where the existing limit is not sufficient to protect the wastewater treatment plant, the city shall amend the local limits to establish an appropriately restrictive limit and take such other measures, within its control and power, that are necessary to prevent recurrences.

H. DOE’s Approval Required to Revise Local Limits. The city shall obtain the DOE’s approval prior to revising local limits or before authorizing over 40,000 GPD of flow from industrial dischargers.

I. Special Agreement.

1. The city may enter into agreements with users to accept pollutants compatible with the treatment system at concentrations greater than those typical of domestic wastewater. Users with BOD or TSS levels higher than 300 mg/L must have such an agreement before commencing discharge. Within such agreements, the city may establish terms of the user’s discharge to the wastewater treatment plant, including maximum flow rates and concentrations. The city may also establish fees to recover costs associated with treating such wastes and monitoring schedules in such agreements. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement including categorical standards.

2. Users discharging or intending to discharge pollutants other than BOD and TSS, and claiming compatibility, must prove to the satisfaction of the public works director that such pollutants are compatible with the wastewater treatment plant. The director may require any claim of compatibility to be endorsed by the DOE.

3. The city may assist, by arrangement or formal agreement, any agencies that regulate hazardous wastes and materials, and air emissions from users in order to maximize state, county, and city resources.

4. The city may specifically arrange to act as an agent of the DOE to determine compliance with treatment or disposal requirements and inspect on-site disposal activities and shipping documents.

5. The city may facilitate compliance by arranging or providing pollution prevention technical assistance for users, especially those in violation of pretreatment standards. The director intends to provide such assistance in coordination and cooperation with the appropriate local, county, and state authority(ies).

J. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of water, nor combine separate waste streams, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The public works director may request that the DOE impose mass limitations on users which he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

K. Pretreatment Facilities.

1. Users shall procure and properly install, operate, and maintain the wastewater facilities which, combined with appropriate practices, are necessary to achieve AKART as defined herein. Such pretreatment facilities shall be designed to achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements within the time limitations specified by the EPA or the state, whichever is more stringent. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the DOE for review and approval in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 173-240 WAC, and shall be disclosed to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying its facility as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city and/or the DOE and meet discharge limitations under the provisions of this chapter. Such facilities shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense.

2. Users shall comply with approved engineering reports, plans and specifications, and operations and maintenance manuals, and shall modify such documents to reflect any proposed modifications of industrial wastewater (pretreatment) facilities. Users shall submit proposals to modify pretreatment facilities to the DOE before implementation in accordance with Chapter 173-240 WAC. Users shall submit a copy of such revised plans and the DOE’s acceptance to the public works director before implementing changes to approved pretreatment facilities. The public works director may audit the compliance of any user, and require changes in operating procedures deemed necessary by the public works director to ensure continued compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

L. Deadline for Compliance with Applicable Pretreatment Requirements.

1. Except as it may relate to existing users for which temporary relief from local limits has been authorized and a schedule of compliance has been approved in accordance with subsection (F) of this section, Local Limits, existing sources to which one or more categorical pretreatment standards are applicable shall comply with all applicable standards within three years of the date the standard is effective unless the pretreatment standard includes a more stringent compliance schedule. The DOE shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user (as defined herein) or any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the EPA’s categorical pretreatment standards.

2. New sources and new users as defined herein shall comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time. In no case shall such time exceed 90 days from beginning a discharge. Prior to commencing discharge, such users shall have all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards installed and in proper operation.

M. Additional Pretreatment Measures.

1. Whenever deemed necessary, the public works director may require users to comply with such conditions as may be necessary to protect the wastewater treatment plant and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Such measures may include: restricting a discharge during peak flow periods; designating that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers; requiring relocation and/or consolidation of discharge points; and/or separating sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams.

2. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the public works director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing grease and oil in excess of the limits in subsection (F) of this section, Local Limits, or excessive amounts of sand or other settleable solids. Such interceptors shall not be required for domestic users. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the public works director and shall be located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Each user shall maintain, inspect, and clean required interceptors on a schedule that ensures they capture the intended pollutants, and prevents their reintroduction into the storm or sanitary sewer systems. Users shall bear all expenses related to installation, maintenance, and repair of interceptors, and the proper disposal of removed materials.

3. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

4. The public works director may require a user discharging more than 10,000 gallons per day or 10 percent of the average daily flow in the wastewater treatment plant, whichever is less, to install and maintain, on its property and at its expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a 24-hour period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least 50 percent of the daily wastewater discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller. The public works director shall direct the control of discharges. The city may require the user to obtain a wastewater discharge permit solely for flow equalization, or to develop a slug discharge control plan (below).

N. Accidental Spill/Slug Discharge Control Plans.

1. The public works director may require any user to install, properly operate, and maintain, at its own expense, facilities to prevent slug loads or accidental discharges of pollutants to the wastewater treatment plant. The public works director may require users to produce and/or implement spill plans developed in compliance with applicable OSHA, health, fire, and DOE regulations applicable to discharges to wastewater treatment plants. When such plans are required by the public works director, they shall contain at least the following elements:

a. A description of all wastewater discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

b. A description of any and all stored chemicals;

c. Procedures for immediately notifying the public works director of any accidental or slug load discharges, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; and

d. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug load discharge, including, but not limited to, the following: inspection and maintenance of chemical storage areas; handling and transfer of materials; loading and unloading operations; control of runoff; worker training; construction of containment structures or equipment; and measures for emergency response.

2. Users shall verbally notify the public works director immediately upon the occurrence of a slug load or accidental discharge of substances regulated by this chapter and take immediate actions to correct the situation. Such notification shall include the following information:

a. The location of discharge;

b. The date and time thereof;

c. The type of waste;

d. The waste concentration and volume; and

e. The corrective actions taken and planned. The user shall follow up with a written notification to the public works director containing the same information within seven days following the discharge.

3. Any user who discharges an accidental discharge or slug load shall be liable for:

a. Recovery of any resultant expenses, losses, and damages to the wastewater treatment plant;

b. Recovery of any fines or settlements levied upon the city by any government agency or court of competent jurisdiction attributable to the discharge; and

c. Applicable fines and penalties assessed upon the user by the city for noncompliance with this chapter.

O. Septage and Liquid Hauled Wastes.

1. Unless specifically approved by the public works director, no septage and liquid hauled wastes shall be introduced into the wastewater treatment plant. If such approval has been given, septage and liquid hauled wastes shall be allowed to be discharged only at such times as are established by the public works director and under the terms and/or conditions established by the public works director.

2. If allowed to be discharged, septage shall not violate any discharge prohibition or standard of this chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. The public works director may issue wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities.

3. Prior to discharging any septage and liquid waste for which approval has been given, septage and liquid waste haulers must provide the public works director with a waste-tracking form for every load when discharged. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler, city septage permit number, truck identification, addresses of the sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste.

4. Haulers of liquid wastes other than septage shall provide full disclosure to the public works director of the source(s) of the wastewater, and such additional information as required by the public works director to characterize the wastewater. The public works director may issue an authorization on his/her own authority, or require haulers of nondomestic wastewater to obtain a waste discharge permit prior to authorizing the discharge. No authorization to discharge such wastewater shall be granted until the public works director has determined to his satisfaction that the wastewater complies with all applicable discharge standards, prohibitions, and requirements of this chapter.

5. The public works director shall exercise absolute discretion in whether to accept any load of septage or liquid hauled wastes. In determining whether to accept a load, the public works director may collect samples of each hauled load and/or require the hauler to provide a wastewater analysis of any load prior to discharge.

P. Requirements to Complete Industrial User Surveys. The public works director shall periodically notify new, existing, and potential users of the requirement to complete an industrial user survey form. Upon notification, users shall fully and accurately complete the survey form, and return the completed form to the public works director within 30 days of receipt. Each user shall maintain a copy of the latest completed survey form at their place of business. Failure to fully or accurately complete a survey form or to maintain the latest survey form on the premises where a wastewater discharge is occurring shall be a violation of this chapter.

Q. Wastewater Discharge Permitting – Requirements for Discharge.

1. No SIU shall discharge wastewater into the wastewater treatment plant without first obtaining a statement from the public works director that the wastewater treatment plant has the hydraulic and/or loading capacity to accept the discharge. Each SIU must also comply with the state requirements listed in subsection (E) of this section, State Requirements, and in particular apply for and receive a wastewater discharge permit from the DOE which authorizes the discharge. The public works director may require proof of application as a condition of new or continued discharge. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve an SIU of his obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local regulation including the requirement for applying AKART.

2. The public works director may require other users, including liquid waste haulers, to apply for, and obtain, applicable wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

3. The public works director may also establish, and require users by letter, permit, or rule to implement those best management practices determined by the public works director to be representative of AKART, or to discontinue use of any substance for which an effective substitute is available which will either:

a. Lessen the potential for violating this chapter or any water quality standard; or

b. May represent a significant decrease either singly, or in combination with other similar users, in the toxicity of pollutant loadings to the wastewater treatment plant.

4. The city may require users seeking authorization to discharge to the wastewater treatment plant to complete a pollution prevention review before submitting their request to discharge to the public works director. The city may also require users who must submit a pollution prevention plan under the state’s Hazardous Waste Reduction Act to provide this plan to the public works director as a condition of initial or continued discharge.

5. Whenever a moratorium has been imposed upon the wastewater treatment plant preventing the addition of new users, the public works director may require any or all users of the wastewater treatment plant to develop plans to reduce their discharges through water reuse, recycling, reclamation, or other applicable management practices, and to implement such plans or other measures deemed appropriate by the public works director to preserve the availability of public sewage treatment services.

R. Permit Requirements for Dangerous Waste Constituents.

1. Users discharging a waste stream containing dangerous wastes as defined in Chapter 173‑303 WAC (listed, characteristic, or criteria wastes) are required to comply with the following permit provisions:

a. Obtain a written authorization to discharge the waste from the public works director, and either obtain specific authorization to discharge the waste in a state waste discharge permit issued by the DOE or accurately describe the waste stream in a temporary permit obtained pursuant to RCW 90.48.165. The description shall include at least:

i. The name of the dangerous waste as set forth in Chapter 173-303 WAC, and the dangerous waste number;

ii. The mass of each constituent expected to be discharged;

iii. The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).

b. Compliance shall be obtained on the following schedule:

i. Before discharge for new users;

ii. Within 30 days after becoming aware of a discharge of dangerous wastes to the wastewater treatment plant for existing users; and

iii. Within 90 days after final rules identifying additional dangerous wastes or new characteristics or criteria of dangerous waste are published for users discharging a newly listed dangerous waste.

S. Disclosure of Records. Each user shall have available at the location of discharge all records and reports required by this chapter, any applicable state and federal regulation, or any permit or order issued thereunder. Each user shall make such records available for review by the public works director during business hours, when activities are being conducted at the facility, and at all reasonable times. Failure to comply with this provision is a violation of this chapter.

T. Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not obligated to obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the DOE shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the public works director may require. The public works director shall determine the schedule and format of such reports, and the pollutant properties, flow rates, and other pertinent information to be reported.

U. Reporting Requirements for Dangerous Waste Constituents. Any user discharging 100 kg or more of dangerous waste in any calendar month to the wastewater treatment plant where the pollutants are not reported through self-monitoring under an applicable state waste discharge permit shall report to the public works director and the DOE the following information to the extent that it is known or readily available to the user:

1. The name of the dangerous waste as set forth in Chapter 173-303 WAC, and the dangerous waste number;

2. The specific hazardous constituents;

3. The estimated mass and concentration of such constituents in waste streams discharged during the calendar month;

4. The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other); and

5. The estimated mass of dangerous waste constituents in waste streams expected to be discharged in the next 12 months.

V. Record Keeping.

1. Users subject to this chapter shall retain, and make readily available for inspection and copying, all records of information maintained to comply with this chapter, a state waste discharge permit, or approved operations and maintenance procedures (inspections, lubrication, repair, etc.). Users subject to monitoring requirements shall keep records of all monitoring activities whether required or voluntary.

2. Monitoring records shall include: the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling; the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.

3. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or wastewater treatment plant, or where the public works director has specifically notified the user that a longer retention period is required.

W. Sampling Requirements for Users.

1. Applicable Requirements. Users which discharge to the wastewater treatment plant shall abide by all applicable wastewater monitoring requirements of this chapter, any applicable order, and any state or federal regulation or permit, including a state waste discharge or NPDES permit. The public works director may require self-monitoring as a requirement of discharge to the wastewater treatment plant, or may conduct city monitoring of any discharge to the wastewater treatment plant.

2. Categorical User Sampling Requirements. Categorical users with combined discharges shall measure flows and pollutant concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). Where feasible, such users shall sample immediately downstream from any pretreatment facilities, unless the DOE determines end-of-pipe monitoring to be more stringent or applicable.

3. Noncategorical Users. All other users, where required to sample, shall measure the flows and pollutant concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements.

4. Data Required. Users which analyze wastewater samples shall record and report with the sampling results the information required by subsection (V) of this section, Record Keeping. All required reports shall also certify that the samples are representative of normal work cycles and wastewater discharges from the user. Whenever a user analyzes wastewater samples for any regulated pollutant more frequently than required, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, the results of such analyses shall be submitted with the next required wastewater discharge report. Reports containing incomplete information shall not demonstrate compliance with this chapter, or a wastewater discharge permit.

X. Analytical Requirements. Users shall ensure that all wastewater analyses required to be reported with the exception of flow, temperature, settleable solids, conductivity, and pH shall be performed by a laboratory registered or accredited under the provisions of Chapter 173-50 WAC. Sampling and analysis techniques used in collection, preservation, and analysis shall be in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain applicable sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA or DOE.

Y. Upset.

1. Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements upon reduction, loss, or failure of its wastewater treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

2. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that:

a. An upset occurred; the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; and it was not due to improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation;

b. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

c. The user has submitted the following information to the wastewater treatment plant and the public works director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, the user must submit a written report within five days containing this same information:

i. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

ii. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

iii. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

3. Users will only have the opportunity for a judicial determination on a claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. In any such enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

Z. Bypass.

1. A user may allow a bypass to occur if it does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, and if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient wastewater treatment operations. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (Z)(2) and (Z)(3) of this section.

2. Requirements for Bypasses Subject to Pretreatment Standards or Requirements.

a. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the wastewater treatment plant at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible.

b. A user shall give verbal notification to the public works director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours of becoming aware of the bypass, and submit a written report to the public works director within five days of becoming aware of the bypass.

c. The written report shall contain: a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; the anticipated time when any ongoing bypass is expected to be halted; and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The public works director may waive the written report if the verbal notification has been received within 24 hours.

3. Exceptions. Bypass is prohibited, and the wastewater treatment plant may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

a. The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated or inadequately treated wastewaters, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

c. The user submitted notices as required in subsection (Z)(2) of this section.

4. The public works director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if he determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection (Z). [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.320 Preliminary treatment facilities.

Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.330 Industrial waste sewer service.

A. Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sanitary sewer with a daily total in excess of 30 pounds of either ammonia, BOD, or suspended solids may, at his option, or shall, when directed by the public works director, construct and maintain approved measurement, sampling, and sample storage facilities for all waste entering the sanitary sewer. These facilities may be used to obtain flow, BOD, and suspended solids data for use as a basis for an industrial waste sewer service charge.

B. In lieu of directing the construction of measurement sampling and sample storage facilities, the public works director may direct each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sanitary sewer which has a daily total in excess of 200 pounds of either BOD or suspended solids to procure at the person’s expense and in a manner approved by the public works director sufficient composite samples on which to base and compute the person’s industrial waste sewer service charge. In the event that automatic flow measurement, sampling, and sample storage facilities are not provided, the industrial waste charge shall be computed using the metered water flow to the premises as a basis for waste flow and the laboratory analysis of samples procured as directed by the public works director as a basis for waste flow and the laboratory analysis of samples procured as directed by the public works director as a basis for computing BOD and suspended solids content of the wastes. Metered water flow shall include all water delivered to or used on the premises and which is discharged to a public sanitary sewer. In the event that private water supplies are used, they shall be metered at the person’s expense. Cooling waters or water not discharged to a public sanitary sewer shall be separately metered at the person’s expense and in a manner approved by the public works director prior to allowing deduction of such flow from the total water used on the premises in computing the industrial waste sewer service charge.

C. Persons discharging industrial wastes into a public sanitary sewer with a daily total of 200 pounds or less of either BOD or suspended solids may install measurement and sampling facilities for the purpose of receiving an industrial waste sewer service charge based on quantity and strength of the waste, or may elect to have their sewer charge based on the commercial sewer rate.

D. The city may determine, by at least three composite waste samples during a year, if a waste discharged to the sanitary sewers, based on either BOD or suspended solids, exceeds 200 pounds per day. If three consecutive measurements by the city indicate that the 200-pound-per-day rate is being exceeded, then the waste will be considered to be an industrial waste. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.340 Flow measurement and sampling facilities requirements.

A. If so directed by the public works director, all devices, access facilities, and related equipment shall be installed by the person discharging the waste, at his expense, in proper operating condition at all times, and readily accessible to city forces during the operating day.

B. The flow measurement device can be a Parshall flume, weir, venturi, nozzle, magnetic flowmeter, or any other type of device providing accurate and continuous flow indication. Pump timers or other indirect measurement devices will not be acceptable.

C. The flowmeter shall be suitable for indicating and totalizing the flow in millions of gallons per day through the device, explained prior, with an error not exceeding plus or minus five percent. The instrument shall be equipped with a set of electrical contacts arranged to momentarily close a circuit to energize a process timer and sampling device for every size quantity of flow. This quantity should be selected so as to ensure a minimum of 50 samples per operating day. Other control variations will be acceptable if it can be demonstrated that the sampling procedure will result in a waste sample which is proportional to the waste flow. The length of operation of the sampling device shall be dependent on the type of sampling arrangement used, but in no case shall the daily collected sample be less than two quarts in volume.

D. The flow measurement and sampling station shall be located and constructed in a manner acceptable to the city. Complete plans on all phases of the proposed installation, including all equipment proposed for use, shall be submitted to the city for approval prior to construction.

E. The person discharging the waste shall keep flow records as required by the city and shall provide qualified personnel to properly maintain and operate the facilities. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.350 Owner to install manhole.

Where required by the public works director, the owner of any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in each building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the public works director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.360 Measurements, tests, and analyses.

All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined at the control manhole provided for in CMC 13.08.350, Owner to install manhole, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. All BOD and suspended solids tests shall be made on composite samples collected proportionate to the rate of flow and over a complete operating period. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.370 Analysis of waste samples.

The waste samples will be analyzed by city forces. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of wastes shall be those set forth in Standard Methods. However, alternate methods for certain analysis of industrial wastes may be used. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.380 Inspection by director.

The public works director and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.390 Service call.

Service calls for any reason including but not limited to complaints, leaks, blockages, or other problems due to trouble in lines not owned by the city or problems in the lines or mechanical devices owned by the city caused by problems or conditions in the private lines or lines owned other than by the city shall be charged to the customer requesting the call at the appropriate rate as provided by city ordinance. The amount charged for the service call shall be billed to the customer as a separate charge and shall be due and payable within seven days after the date of the bill. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.400 Disconnection of service, abated building.

Whenever a premises provided with sewer service has been found by the proper authorities to be dangerous to human life and/or unfit for human habitation and notice of such findings has been provided to the public works director by said authorities, the public works director shall require the owner of said premises to disconnect the side sewer that was “serving said abated building” from the public sewer and use an approved plug or other device or fitting that will eliminate any ground or surface water, dirt, or any other object from entering the sewer from the point of disconnection. It is the responsibility of the owner to notify the public works director when such disconnection has been properly made so it can be inspected before backfilling occurs. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.410 Damaging sewer system.

Any person causing damage to any property belonging to the city shall be liable to the city for any and all damages resulting either directly or indirectly therefrom. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.420 Crime to damage or interfere with access to the sewer system.

No person shall disturb, break, deface, damage, or trespass upon any property belonging to or connected with the sewer system of the city in any manner whatsoever. No person shall store, maintain, or keep any goods, merchandise, materials, or rubbish within a distance of five feet or interfere with the access or operation of any manhole, lift station or any other equipment or facility of the sewer system. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.430 Emergency interruption of service.

A. In the event of emergency or whenever the public health, safety, or the equitable distribution of water so demands, the public works director may authorize the city to change, reduce, alter, or limit the time for or temporarily discontinue sewer service. Sewer service may be temporarily interrupted for purposes of making repairs, extensions, or doing other necessary work.

B. Before so changing, reducing, limiting, or interrupting the sewer service, the city shall notify, insofar as practical, all sewer consumers affected. The city shall not be responsible for any damage resulting from interruption, change, or failure of the sewer system. In addition, the city makes no commitment as to the continuity of service; and will not be liable for injuries or damage due to interruption of service. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.440 Right to terminate sewer service.

A. The city reserves the right to terminate sewer service for any residence or commercial or industrial customer where it is determined by the city that the wastes being discharged:

1. Are causing operational problems with the sewer collection system, lift station, and/or wastewater treatment plant.

2. Are in some way damaging pipelines, manholes, lift stations, or equipment and/or machinery at the wastewater treatment plant.

3. Are causing health or safety problems either with the city sewer department personnel or other persons.

B. Termination of such sewer service shall be in effect until it is determined by the public works director that any and all problems have been corrected and some action or other steps have been taken to prevent their reoccurrence. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.450 Construction work in streets.

All persons, firms, corporations, and governmental agencies, and their contractors, performing street work that may interfere, conflict, affect or endanger the sewer system of the city shall be required to obtain a right-of-way permit. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.460 Protection of the public health.

The public works director shall conduct periodic inspections of the sewer system in coordination with the appropriate health department. The public works director shall, from time to time, suggest rules and regulations deemed necessary by him to the city council to protect or augment the operation of the sewer system. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.470 Payment for sewer service.

In accordance with city ordinance, payment shall be due on the twentieth of the month. Unpaid statements become delinquent on the twenty-first day of the month or at 5:00 p.m. on the next full business day and a delinquency charge as established by city ordinance shall be added to each unpaid account and a delinquent statement sent by mail. Payment of the delinquent balance must be received within seven days of the date of the delinquent notice to avoid service interruption. Sewer statements for residential customers will be mailed to customers on a bimonthly basis. Sewer statements for commercial and industrial customers will be mailed to those customers on a monthly basis. All statements are to be paid either by mail or in person to the city. The owner of the premises receiving sewer service shall have the right to have statements for service charges mailed to a tenant, lessee or agent, but such mailing shall not relieve the property owner for liability of payment for charges incurred. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.480 Charge for special improvements.

Where special improvements or upgrading projects have been installed and the costs of such improvements are determined to be financed by user charges to the customers served by or benefiting from such improvements, these customers shall be responsible for an additional charge to be added to the customer’s statement. The amount of this additional charge shall be as determined for the specific improvement or upgrading project. Such additional charge shall be to satisfy all debt service requirements and other related costs. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.490 Delinquency/lien.

A. All sewer rates shall be charged against the premises for which the service was connected. Any and all charges provided for, when the same become delinquent and unpaid, shall constitute a lien against the premises to which the same has been furnished. Enforcement of a lien and collection of a lien shall include, but not be limited to, the right to stop service and deny service thereafter to any and all owners and/or occupants of the premises until the charges for service and/or other charges have been paid in full.

B. In cases where the occupant of the premises moves to another location within the system and applies for service at the new location, services may be denied at such location until and unless any statement for service against the first location is fully paid.

C. If any such charges are not paid, the city may record a lien at the office of the county auditor against the property for which the service was connected. Such lien shall include the delinquent charges and such customer shall be responsible for all costs incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney’s fees, for preparing the lien and the fee for recording the lien.

D. Failure to receive mail will not be recognized as a valid excuse for failure to pay charges due. Notice of change in ownership of property and change in mailing address must be given in writing by the property owner or his agent to the city. The public works director may require an advance or satisfactory security for sewer service to be furnished, and if such payment is not made or security furnished within the time fixed by the public works director, sewer service may be discontinued to premises. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.500 Delinquent charges – Discontinuance of service.

A. In the event of failure to pay sewer service charges after they become delinquent, or failure to have flow or sampling devices in proper operating condition for more than one week, the city shall have the right to remove or close sewer connections, and enter upon the property for accomplishing such purposes.

B. The expense of such removal, or closing, as well as the expense of restoring service, shall likewise be a debt due to the city and a lien upon the property and may be recovered by civil action in the name of the city against the property owner, the person, or both. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.510 Restoration of service.

Sewer service shall not be restored until the owner pays the lesser of either the current connection/capacity charges for such sewer service or back (unpaid) sewer service capital improvement rate charges for sewer service. Back charges shall be equal to the total current sewer service capital improvement rate charges for minimum sewer service multiplied by the total number of months that the sewer service has been in an inactive status and/or for the period of months that such capital improvement rate charges have not been paid and all other charges, such as the expense of removal, closing, and restoration of sewer line, and all applicable fees as established by the storm and surface water and water system ordinances shall have been paid. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.520 Delinquent charges – Change of ownership.

Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.530 Sewer main extension request.

When a person desires to extend a city sewer main, that person must make a written request to the city and state on that request the location where the extension is desired, the purpose for extension and give details and extent of any development he is considering, as well as any other factors as may be pertinent. The public works director shall evaluate all requests for main extensions. If the extension is considered feasible, then the pipe diameter and other conditions shall be determined by the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.540 Sewer main extension installation.

The person requesting the main extension shall be responsible for all costs of installation. The person requesting the main extension shall also be charged a fee to pay the costs of the inspection performed by the public works department personnel and/or contracted engineer’s inspector. The amount of the fee for inspections shall be determined after assessing the entire project. The extension shall be installed in accordance with the engineering development code. [Ord. 867B, 2011; Ord. 819B § 13, 2007.]


13.08.550 Vandalism.

No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the wastewater treatment plant.

Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.560 Confidential information.

A. Records kept by the city with respect to the nature and frequency of discharges from any user shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to confidentiality under the law.

B. Users shall clearly mark “confidential” on all areas of correspondence they wish to be held confidential from the public, and feel is afforded such protection. The city shall determine if such information is legally afforded this protection under the law upon receipt of a request for such information. Only information marked “confidential” and determined by the city to legally qualify as such shall be withheld from the public.

C. No correspondence claimed as “confidential” shall be withheld from any state or federal agency responsible for oversight of the city’s NPDES permit or authorized to implement the NPDES, or state or federal pretreatment programs. Wastewater constituents and characteristics, and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302, will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.570 City monitoring of wastewater.

The city shall follow the procedures required of users described in CMC 13.08.310, Industrial pretreatment requirements, whenever conducting wastewater sampling of any industrial user when such sampling is conducted to ensure compliance with this chapter and applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.580 Right of entry for inspection and sampling.

A. The public works director shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this chapter or by the DOE, is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof.

B. The public works director shall have the right to set up on any user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, compliance monitoring, and/or metering of a user’s operations. It shall be the policy of the public works director to inform the DOE of such activities where users hold a state waste discharge permit in order to make the results of such sampling available to the DOE.

C. Users shall allow the public works director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

D. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the public works director and representatives of state and federal authority will be allowed to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their respective duties.

E. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe, ready, and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the public works director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.

F. Unreasonable delays or failure to allow the public works director access to any area to perform functions authorized under this chapter shall be grounds for termination of wastewater treatment services, and enforcement as authorized by this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.590 Monitoring facilities.

A. Any user notified by the DOE or the city that monitoring facilities are required shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow proper inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the wastewater treatment plant. Monitoring facilities shall be situated on the user’s premises, unless this would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user. In such cases, the city may allow the user to construct the facility in the public street or sidewalk area, providing it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.

B. When the public works director or the DOE determines it is appropriate, they may require a user to construct and maintain monitoring facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line or wastewater treatment system).

C. There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facilities to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The user shall maintain the facility, sampling, and measuring equipment at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at his own expense.

D. All wastewater monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable construction standards and specifications. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be regularly calibrated, but no less frequently than annually, to ensure their accuracy. Calibration records shall be available for inspection of the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.600 Search warrants.

A. If the public works director or authorized inspector acting as his/her agent has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, then the public works director shall seek issuance of a search and/or seizure warrant from Lewis County superior court when:

1. There is probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter;

2. There is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter, an order issued hereunder, or any wastewater discharge permit; or

3. Necessary to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community.

B. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the public works director in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city.

C. In the event the public works director has reason to believe a situation represents an imminent threat to public health and safety, and where entry has been denied or the area is inaccessible, the public works director may enter in the company of a uniformed police officer, before a requested warrant has been produced, in order to determine if the suspected situation exists and, if so, to take such actions necessary to protect the public. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.610 Consent orders.

A. The public works director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such consent orders shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time schedule also specified by the consent order.

B. Compliance schedules, when included in consent orders, may not extend the compliance date beyond any applicable state or federal deadlines. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to CMC 13.08.690, Criminal prosecution, and shall be judicially enforceable.

C. Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a consent order by the user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or for any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.620 Compliance orders.

A. Whenever the public works director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the public works director may issue a compliance order to the user responsible for the violation. This order shall direct that adequate pretreatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances be installed and properly operated and maintained. The order shall specify that wastewater services, including collection and treatment, shall be discontinued and/or applicable penalties imposed unless, following a specified time period, the directed actions are taken.

B. Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the violation or noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the wastewater treatment plant. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance beyond any applicable state or federal deadlines, nor does a compliance order release the user from liability from any past, present, or continuing violation(s). Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.

C. Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a compliance order by a user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.630 Administrative (show cause) hearing.

A. A user shall be afforded the opportunity to an administrative hearing to contest the city’s determination to suspend services, impose penalties, recover costs, or establish compliance schedules. A user shall also have the right to a hearing prior to termination of a user’s wastewater collection and treatment services.

B. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the administrative hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served on an authorized representative of the user (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing date.

C. An administrative hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.640 Cease and desist orders.

A. The public works director may issue a cease and desist order upon finding a user has or is violating either: this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued by the DOE, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement. The decision to issue a cease and desist order shall consider the likelihood that a user’s violations in conjunction with other discharges could cause a threat to the wastewater treatment plant, wastewater treatment plant workers, or the public, or cause pass through, interference, or a violation of the wastewater treatment plant’s NPDES permit. The order issued by the public works director will direct the user to cease and desist all such violations and to:

1. Immediately cease such actions or discharges as described;

2. Comply with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements;

3. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.650 Emergency suspension of wastewater services.

A. The public works director may immediately suspend wastewater services, including collection and treatment, after informal notice to the user, if it appears to the city that such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to either the environment, normal operation of the wastewater treatment plant, or the health or welfare of any person or the general public.

B. Any user notified of a suspension of its wastewater discharge shall immediately cease all such discharges. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the public works director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the wastewater treatment plant, its receiving stream, or the danger to the public. The public works director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in CMC 13.08.660, Termination of treatment services (nonemergency), are initiated against the user.

C. It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent or attempt to prevent the public works director and/or city from terminating wastewater collection and treatment services in an emergency situation, by barring entry, by physically interfering with city employees or contractors, or by any other means.

D. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the public works director prior to the date of any administrative hearing authorized by this chapter.

E. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring an administrative hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.660 Termination of treatment services (nonemergency).

A. The public works director shall have authority to terminate wastewater services, including collection and treatment, through the issuance of a termination order to any user upon determining that such user has:

1. Refused access allowed by this chapter thereby preventing the implementation of any purpose of this chapter;

2. Violated any provision of this chapter including the discharge prohibitions and standards listed in CMC 13.08.310, Industrial pretreatment requirements; or

3. Violated any lawful order of the city issued with respect to this chapter.

B. For users holding permits to discharge to the city wastewater treatment plant, violation of the following conditions is also grounds for terminating discharge services:

1. Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents or characteristics;

2. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents or characteristics; or

3. Violation of any term or condition of the user’s waste discharge permit.

C. Issuance of a termination order by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.670 Injunctive relief.

When the public works director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he may petition the Lewis County superior court through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate. Such injunction shall restrain or compel specific compliance with an applicable wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.680 Civil penalties.

A. A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an order issued hereunder, a wastewater discharge permit, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement not reserved by a permit by the DOE shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of noncompliance with monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of such noncompliance.

B. In addition to the penalty amounts assessable in this section, the public works director may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with compliance and enforcement activities authorized under this chapter. This shall include recovery of costs for sampling and monitoring, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city, including penalties for noncompliance with the city’s NPDES permit to the extent attributable to the user.

C. The city shall petition the Lewis County superior court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In recommending the amount of civil liability, the public works director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires, and shall present this analysis as evidence in support of the recommended penalty.

D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.690 Criminal prosecution.

A. A user which has willfully or negligently violated any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 per violation, per day, plus costs of prosecution or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by both fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the Chehalis municipal court.

B. The above provision applies to any user which knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter.

C. Where willful or negligent introduction of a substance into the wastewater treatment plant causes personal injury or property damage, this action shall be in addition to any other civil or criminal action for personal injury or property damage available under the law. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.700 Water supply severance.

Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.710 Public nuisances.

A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the public works director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the Chehalis Municipal Code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.720 Performance bonds and liability insurance.

The public works director may decline to reinstate wastewater collection and treatment service to any user whose wastewater services were suspended or terminated under the provisions of this chapter, unless such user, at the sole discretion of the public works director, either:

A. First files with the city a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the public works director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance; or

B. First submits proof that the user has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair wastewater treatment plant damage caused by its discharge. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.730 Remedies nonexclusive.

The provisions in CMC 13.08.610 through 13.08.720 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions concurrently or sequentially against a noncompliant user or to take other actions as warranted by the circumstances. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.740 Innovative settlements and supplemental environmental projects.

A. In any enforcement action allowed under this chapter, the public works director may recommend, and the city may agree, to set aside all or portions of the recommended penalty amount in favor of requiring completion of a project of environmental benefit to the wastewater treatment plant of equal or greater value than the proposed penalty. Such projects must be proposed or agreed to in writing by the user.

B. In recommending this option, the public works director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following criteria:

1. The net environmental benefit;

2. The ability of the project to help achieve or ensure compliance;

3. The willingness of the party to change the circumstances that led to the noncompliance; and

4. The responsible party’s technical and financial ability to successfully complete the project.

C. In enforcement actions taken by the DOE, the city may make written recommendations either for, or against, an innovative settlement agreement with a noncompliant user based on the above criteria. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.750 General prohibited discharge standards.

A. The city may allow an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against a user for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in this section. An affirmative defense requires the user to prove to the satisfaction of the public works director that:

1. The user did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference;

2. The discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit; and

3. In the case of interference, the user was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

B. This defense does not relieve the user from responsibility for enforcement to recover costs as provided under CMC 13.08.670, Injunctive relief, and CMC 13.08.680, Civil penalties. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.760 State responsibility for administrative actions.

The DOE is charged with permitting and regulating SIUs discharging to the city wastewater treatment plant. Except for emergency actions, it shall be the policy of the public works director to coordinate actions in regard to control of such users with the DOE. Failure to conduct such coordination, however, shall not invalidate any action of the city authorized by this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.770 Notification of violation.

A. Whenever the public works director finds that any user has violated or is continuing to violate any provision of this chapter, or an order issued hereunder, the public works director may serve upon such user written notice of the violation.

B. Within 10 days of receipt of such notice of violation, the user shall submit to the public works director an explanation of the violation and a plan to satisfactorily correct and prevent the reoccurrence of such violation(s). The plan shall include specific actions the user will take, and the completion dates of each. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.

C. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.780 Violations and penalties.

Any person willfully violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person found guilty of such violation shall be fined a sum not to exceed $500.00. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.790 Severability clause.

If any section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or void, such invalidity shall not thereby affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.800 Enforcement.

It shall be the duty of the employees of the public works department, police and fire services department and community development department to give vigil and aid to the public works director in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and to this end they shall report all violations thereof which come to their knowledge to the public works director. [Ord. 867B, 2011; Ord. 810B § 6, 2006; Ord. 767B, 2004; Ord. 766B, 2004.]


13.08.810 Repeal.

Ordinance No. 696-B, passed the thirteenth day of August, 2001, and Ordinance No. 737-B, passed the twenty-seventh day of January, 2003, shall be, and the same hereby are, repealed. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]


13.08.820 Effective date.

The effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be February 22, 2011. [Ord. 867B, 2011.]

Upon retirement of the loans incurred beginning in 2003 to help pay for the acquisition of land for and construction of the wastewater treatment plant, associated facilities, and upgrades of the Prindle and Riverside pump stations, the amount of money then going toward that debt service shall be removed from the rate structure in effect at that time. [Ord. 757B, 2003; Ord. 729B, 2002.]


13.16.090 Wastewater surcharge fees (latecomer fees).

A. The public works director may, at his discretion, establish and adopt wastewater surcharge fees that, after their establishment, shall be imposed upon customers connecting to specifically designated wastewater utility extension(s) and/or wastewater system improvements in defined areas.

B. Such surcharge fees shall be based on criteria established within the standard latecomer agreement form created by the development review committee.

C. In order for a wastewater surcharge fee to be established, in addition to or separately from a request approving and authorizing the installation and/or construction of a wastewater utility extension(s) or wastewater system improvements, the developer, property owner, or other entity that installed and/or constructed such wastewater utility extension(s) or wastewater system improvements, or proposes to install and/or construct wastewater utility extension(s) or wastewater system improvements, shall submit to the public works director a specific request (a latecomer agreement form created by the development review committee) to establish a wastewater surcharge fee.

D. The public works director may require additional information from the developer, property owner, or other entity requesting the establishment of such wastewater surcharge fee. The director may also deny the request to establish the wastewater surcharge fee, or establish a different amount of wastewater surcharge fee, other than the fee calculated in the standard latecomer agreement form. If a wastewater surcharge fee is approved, the director may impose other conditions, limitations, and/or a duration for said wastewater surcharge fee.

E. The purpose of establishing such wastewater surcharge fees is to reimburse developers, property owners, or other entities that installed and/or constructed wastewater utility extension(s) or wastewater system improvements for a portion of their costs for the installation and/or construction of wastewater utility extension(s) or wastewater system improvements, for which subsequent, nonparticipating future customers benefit. The city shall collect established surcharges, from such nonparticipating future customers, at the time wastewater capacity charges are paid, and then reimburse the surcharge(s) to the developer, property owner or other entity that installed and/or constructed such wastewater utility extension(s) or wastewater system improvements, for which such surcharge(s) was established.

F. Such wastewater surcharge fees shall be in addition to any other charges that may be applicable. [Ord. 847B § 6, 2009; Ord. 757B, 2003; Ord. 729B, 2002.]

Chapter 13.20 SMALL WORKS ROSTER

Sections:

13.20.010    Established.

13.20.020    Requests for inclusion.

13.20.030    Requests for inclusion – Application.

13.20.040    Bidding and proposal procedures.


13.20.010 Established.

A. The city shall establish a small works roster for public work or improvement contracts of $300,000 or less. The small works roster shall be used to award public work contracts for construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property.

B. The small works roster ordinance is based on Chapter 138 Laws of 2000 (the “Act”). The Washington State Legislature amended the authorization in RCW 39.04.155 to establish a common small works roster procedure. [Ord. 974B, 2017.]


13.20.020 Requests for inclusion.

The small works roster to be established shall be comprised of all contractors who have requested to be on the roster and are, where required by law, properly licensed or registered to perform such work in the state of Washington as may be proposed by the city. Contractors desiring to be placed on the roster must keep current records of any applicable licenses, certifications, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the city as a condition of being placed on the small works roster. At least once a year, the city shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction a notice of the existence of the roster and solicit the names of contractors for such roster. In addition, responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster at any time they submit a written request and necessary records. Master contracts may be required to be signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster. [Ord. 974B, 2017.]


13.20.030 Requests for inclusion – Application.

Contractors requesting to be on the small works roster shall submit an application provided by the public works department and shall, in addition to completion of said application form, show proof of ability to provide insurance naming the city as additional insured prior to the performance of any contract, a performance bond prior to performance of any contract, a list of references of similar projects performed by the contractor in the two years previous to applying for placement on the small works roster, proof of appropriate contractor license, and a statement that the contractor has no previous record of default in the performance of or failed to complete a written public contract and has not been convicted of a crime arising from a previous public contract. [Ord. 974B, 2017.]


13.20.040 Bidding and proposal procedures.

A. Whenever work shall be done by contract by the city, the estimate of which is $300,000 or less, the city may use the small works roster. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the small works roster. As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least five contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate roster. However, if the estimated cost of the work is from $100,000 to $200,000, and the city chooses to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors, it must also notify the remaining contractors on the roster that quotations on the work are being sought. The city has the sole option of determining whether this notice to the remaining contractors is made by publishing notice in the local newspaper, or mailing a notice to these contractors by mail, facsimile, or other electronic means.

B. Whenever possible, the city shall invite at least one proposal from a minority or woman contractor who shall otherwise qualify under this chapter.

C. All invitations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed and materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. When awarding such a contract for public work or improvement, the estimated cost of which is $300,000 or less, the city shall award the contract to the contractor submitting the lowest responsible bid.

D. The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if it is done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the small works roster process. The city soliciting bids may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services. [Ord. 974B, 2017.]

13.24.090    Prior acts ratified and confirmed.


13.24.010 Purpose – Findings.

The city finds and declares:

A. All real property in the city contributes runoff to the common storm and surface water problem, and all real property in the city benefits, either directly or indirectly, from the storm and surface water utility of the city.

B. The development of real property, as measured by the square footage of impervious surface area, is an appropriate basis for the determination of an individual parcel’s contribution to the problem of storm and surface water runoff. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.020 Potential hazards designated – Regulation by storm water utility.

The city finds and declares that absent effective maintenance, operation, regulation, and control, existing storm water drainage conditions in all drainage basins within the city constitute a potential hazard to the health, safety, and general welfare of the city. The city council further finds that natural and manmade storm water facilities and conveyance together constitute a storm water drainage system and that effective regulation and control of storm water through formation, by the city, of a storm and surface water utility requires the transfer to the storm water utility of all storm water facilities and conveyances and related rights belonging to the city. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.030 Storm and surface water management.

A. Utility Created – Responsibilities. There is created and established pursuant to Chapters 35A.80 and 35.67 RCW, and Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, a storm and surface water utility. All references to “the utility” in this chapter refer to the storm and surface water utility. The utility will have authority and responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance, administration, and operation of all city storm water conveyances and facilities. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.040 Separate utility.

In accordance with the provisions of Chapter 35.67 RCW, the storm and surface water utility is hereby established as a separate utility, together with all additions, extensions, and betterments thereof at any time made. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.050 Property transferred to utility.

Title and all other incidents of ownership of the following assets are hereby transferred to and vested in the utility: all properties, interests, and physical and intangible rights of every nature owned or held by the city, however acquired, insofar as they relate to or concern storm water, further including, without limitation, all properties, interests, and rights acquired by adverse possession or by prescription, directly or through another, in and to the drainage or storage, or both, of storm waters, through, under, or over lands, watercourses, sloughs, streams, ponds, lakes, and swamps, all beginning in each instance at a point where storm waters first enter the system of the city and ending in each instance at a point where the storm waters exit from the system of the city, and in width to the full extent of inundation caused by storm or flood conditions. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.060 Storm water system and plan – Adopted.

There is specified and adopted as the original system and plan of the utility, including a declaration of the estimated cost thereof, the city comprehensive storm water management plan, adopted by motion by the city council on August 12, 1991. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.070 Utility administered by public works director.

The utility shall be administered by the public works director. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.080 Review and update of plan and system operation.

The public works department shall continue the review and update of the storm water management plan and ordinances relating to the management and operation of the storm water system, and the regulation and enforcement of any activities that may adversely impact the storm water system and receiving waters. Whenever the department determines that an amendment or modification to these regulations is necessary or in the best interest of the city and the storm water system, the department shall be responsible to present any recommendation(s) to the city council for their consideration. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]


13.24.090 Prior acts ratified and confirmed.

Any acts made consistent with the authority and prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are ratified and confirmed. [Ord. 479B, 1992.]

13.28.010 Definitions.

As used in this chapter:

“Closed system” means a portion or type of the storm water system that contains or includes piping, manholes, catchbasins, and/or other enclosed facilities as part of the collection or transmission facilities.

“Customer” means a person in whose name service is rendered, as evidenced by the signature on the application or contract for that service, or, in the absence of a signed instrument, by the receipt and payment of bills regularly issued in his/her/its name regardless of the identity of the actual user of the service.

“Detention structure” means an approved permanent structure designed to store runoff for discharge at rates approximating what would have occurred under predevelopment conditions.

“Equivalent service unit (ESU)” means a configuration of development or impervious surfaces on a parcel, estimated to contribute an amount of runoff to the city’s storm and surface water drainage system which is approximately equal to that created by the average single-family residential parcel. One ESU is equal to 3,000 square feet of impervious surface area or any portion thereof.

“Impervious surface” means that hard-surfaced area which either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle and/or causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from that present under natural conditions. Impervious surfaces may include, but are not limited to, rooftops, concrete or asphalt paving, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots or storage areas, and oiled, macadam or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration or runoff of surface water. The city has measured, through aerial photography and land surface evaluation processes, the number of square feet of impervious surface on all non-single-family residential parcels.

“Open system” means a portion or type of the storm water system that does not contain or include piping, manholes, catchbasins, and/or other enclosed facilities as part of the collection or transmission facilities, and consists entirely of roadside or regional ditches, drainage canals or open channels, other than sections of culverts over driveways, roadways, or other facilities that cross the storm drainage systems.

“Parcel” means the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries, and surface area which is documented for tax purposes and given a tax account (lot) number by the county assessor.

“Parcel, developed” means any parcel which has been altered by grading or filling of the ground surface or by construction of any improvement or other impervious surface area, which affects the hydraulic properties of the parcel.

“Parcel, single-family residential” means any parcel of land which is improved with a dwelling unit for occupancy by a single family or a similar group of people. A single-family residential parcel also may be an individual dwelling, mobile home, flat, or unit in a multifamily building or portion thereof for occupancy as the home, residence, or sleeping place for one or more persons, provided each such dwelling, mobile home, flat, or unit is owned separately. If more than three of any dwellings, mobile homes, flats, or units occupy the same parcel of land, the parcel shall be considered a non-single-family parcel, and subject to charges as identified in CMC 13.28.030(F).

“Parcel, undeveloped” means any parcel which has not been altered by grading or filling of the ground surface, or by construction of any improvements or other impervious surface area which affects the hydraulic properties of the parcel.

“Retention structure” means an approved permanent structure that provides for the storage of runoff by means of a permanent pool of water or infiltration.

“Runoff” means that portion of precipitation either from rain or melted snow that ultimately reaches natural watercourses by flowing over the surface of the land.

“Utility” means the storm and surface water utility. [Ord. 868B, 2011.]


13.28.015 Storm and surface water capital facilities charges.

A. Storm and surface water capital facilities charges shall be, and the same hereby are, imposed for increased impervious surface area in the city, which storm and surface water capital facilities charges shall be paid for each ESU as follows: $489.00 per ESU.

13.28.020 System of charges – Applicability.

There is hereby imposed a system of rates and charges on each parcel of real property within the city served by or to which is available for service the storm water utility established by Chapter 13.24 CMC. The charges are found to be reasonable and necessary to fund the current administration, planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of existing storm and surface water facilities; provided, however, that the city reserves the right to fix, alter, regulate, and control the rates and charges. [Ord. 868B, 2011.]

13.28.035 Storm water surcharge fees (latecomer fees).

A. The public works director may, at his discretion, establish and adopt storm water surcharge fees that, after their establishment, shall be imposed upon customers connecting to specifically designated storm water utility extension(s) and/or storm water system improvements in defined areas.

B. Such surcharge fees shall be based on criteria established within the standard latecomer agreement form created by the development review committee.

C. In order for a storm water surcharge fee to be established, in addition to or separately from a request approving and authorizing the installation and/or construction of a storm water utility extension(s) or storm water system improvements, the developer, property owner, or other entity that installed and/or constructed such storm water utility extension(s) or storm water system improvements, or proposes to install and/or construct storm water utility extension(s) or storm water system improvements, shall submit to the public works director a specific request (a latecomer agreement form created by the development review committee) to establish a storm water surcharge fee.

D. The public works director may require additional information from the developer, property owner, or other entity requesting the establishment of such storm water surcharge fee. The director may also deny the request to establish the storm water surcharge fee, or establish a different amount of storm water surcharge fee, other than the fee calculated in the standard latecomer agreement form. If a storm water surcharge fee is approved, the director may impose other conditions, limitations, and/or a duration for said storm water surcharge fee.

E. The purpose of establishing such storm water surcharge fees is to reimburse developers, property owners, or other entities that installed and/or constructed storm water utility extension(s) or storm water system improvements for a portion of their costs for the installation and/or construction of storm water utility extension(s) or storm water system improvements, for which subsequent, nonparticipating future customers benefit. The city shall collect established surcharges, from such nonparticipating future customers, at the time storm water capacity charges are paid, and then reimburse the surcharge(s) to the developer, property owner or other entity that installed and/or constructed such storm water utility extension(s) or storm water system improvements, for which such surcharge(s) was established.

F. Such storm water surcharge fees shall be in addition to any other charges that may be applicable. [Ord. 868B, 2011; Ord. 847B § 7, 2009.]


13.28.040 Appeal of ESU charges.

A. Any person, within 60 days after being notified of the determination of ESUs for a particular parcel(s), who considers the ESU determination or storm water utility charge calculation(s) applied to the parcel to be inaccurate, or who otherwise disagrees with a storm water utility rate determination, may apply to the public works director for a rate adjustment, stating in writing the grounds of the appeal.

B. Any person, after making or causing changes to a particular parcel(s) where such changes or modifications reduce the total amount of impervious area of the parcel, may apply to the director for a redetermination of ESU(s). The director shall review the case file and determine whether a readjustment is warranted. If the director determines that an adjustment is warranted, the director shall cause the redetermination of impervious area and assignment of current ESU(s) to take place.

C. Any person, after making or causing changes to a particular parcel(s) where such changes or modifications provide mitigation that both exceeds that required by the city as a condition of a development and is available for the benefit of other developed parcel(s), may apply to the director for a rate adjustment, stating in writing the reason or grounds of the request. The director shall review the case file and determine whether a rate adjustment is warranted. If the director determines that an adjustment is warranted, the actual total monthly service charge shall be computed by multiplying the measured ESUs for the parcel by the following monthly unit rate:

	Year	Amount per Unit

	2012	$ 5.10	 

	2013	5.49	 

	2014	5.89

E. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant a right to judicial review, which does not otherwise exist in law. (In all cases, the decision of the council shall be final and conclusive.) [Ord. 902B, 2012; Ord. 868B, 2011.]


13.28.050 Billing of charges.

Utility rates and charges for each parcel of developed real property within the city shall be computed on a bimonthly basis for residential accounts and on a monthly basis for non-single-family accounts. The amount to be billed shall be included on the existing water/sewer bill as a separate line item. A “storm water only” statement will be sent to those property owners who are not city water or sanitary sewer customers. The city shall bill the owner of the served property for the payment of utility rates and charges specified in this chapter; however, the owner may have the bills mailed to a tenant, or agent, but this shall not relieve the owner from liability for utility rates and charges. [Ord. 868B, 2011.]


13.28.060 Nonpayment of bills – Storm water service discontinuance conditions.

A. Payment for storm water services shall be due on the twentieth day of the month. Unpaid statements become delinquent on the twenty-first day of the month, or the following business day, and a delinquency charge, as established by city ordinance, of 10 percent of the past due amount with a minimum penalty of $1.00 shall be added to each unpaid account and a delinquent statement mailed. Payment of the outstanding balance must be received within seven days or water and/or sewer service shall be disconnected in accordance with the provisions of CMC 13.04.500 and 13.08.500, and a lien may be placed upon the property being served by filing a notice with the city clerk. The city clerk shall send a written notice of filing to the recorded owner of the property.

B. For any customer who is not a water and/or sanitary sewer customer and who has not paid a storm water bill within 40 days of the due date, a lien may be placed upon the property being serviced by filing a notice with the city clerk. The city clerk shall send a written notice of filing to the recorded owner of the property. [Ord. 868B, 2011.]


13.28.070 Nonpayment of bills – Penalties for delinquency.

A delinquency charge equal to 10 percent of the total storm water services charge shall be added to each unpaid bill. [Ord. 868B, 2011.]

A. In the event that any person, firm, or corporation shall tender as payment of water, sewer or storm water services an amount insufficient to pay in full all of the charges so billed, credit shall be given first to the storm water utility charges, second to the charges for sanitary sewer service, and lastly to the charges for water service.

B. In the event that any utility account shall become delinquent, water service may be terminated by the city in accordance with the provisions delineated in CMC 13.04.500. Such utility account shall be discontinued until all delinquent rates or charges for the use of the storm water service, sanitary sewer service, and water service shall have been paid in full. [Ord. 868B, 2011.]


13.28.090 Storm water utility account – Annual report.

A. All money collected through utility rates and charges shall be deposited in a storm water utility account, water utility account or in the sanitary sewer utility account as established and maintained by the finance manager.

B. The finance manager and the public works director shall conduct an annual review of the utility’s operations, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the storm water retention, detention, collection and conveyance systems, and the schedule of rates and charges. They shall submit a report to the city manager by June 1st of each calendar year, summarizing the review and containing recommendations for rate adjustments to:

“Waste” means surplus materials resulting from on-site construction and disposed of at other locations.

“Wetland” means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and which under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

“Working days” means days exclusive of Saturday and Sunday during which weather conditions or soil conditions permit land-disturbing activity to be undertaken. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.030 Control objectives.

The basic control objectives which are to be considered in developing and implementing an erosion and sedimentation control plan are to:

A. Identify Critical Areas. On-site areas which are subject to severe erosion, and off-site areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion and/or sedimentation, are to be identified and receive special attention; and

B. Limit Time of Exposure. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time; and

C. Limit Exposed Areas. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time; and

D. Control Storm Water Runoff. Storm water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure; and

E. Manage Site Runoff. When the increase in the velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a land-disturbing activity is sufficient to cause accelerated erosion of the receiving water body, plans are to include measures to control the velocity at the point of discharge so as to minimize accelerated erosion of the site and increased sedimentation of the water body; and

F. Control Sedimentation. All land-disturbing activity is to be planned and conducted so as to prevent off-site sedimentation damage. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.040 Minimum criteria and standards.

At a minimum, plans for land-disturbing activities shall comply with the most recent version of the UBC, Chapter 70, and the provisions herein. The stricter shall apply. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.050 Resolution of conflicting provisions.

Whenever conflicts exist between federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or rules, the more restrictive provision shall apply. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.060 Chapter provisions not exclusive.

Neither this chapter nor any administrative decision made under it:

A. Exempts the permittee from procuring other required permits or complying with the requirements and conditions of such a permit; or

B. Limits the right of any person to maintain, at any time, any appropriate action, at law or in equity, for relief or damages against the permittee arising from the permitted activity. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.070 Permit – Required when – Standards for work.

No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards:

A. Plan Required. No person shall initiate any land-disturbing activity which uncovers more than one contiguous acre without having a permit as required by this chapter. All work must be performed in accordance with a sequence shown on the approved plan or a revised sequence approved by the community development director;

B. Protection of Property. Persons conducting land-disturbing activity shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activity;

C. Buffer Zone. No land-disturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to an environmentally sensitive area unless a buffer zone is provided along the margin of the area of sufficient width to confine visible siltation within the 25 percent of the buffer zone nearer the land-disturbing activity; provided, that this subsection shall not apply to a land-disturbing activity in connection with the construction of facilities to be located on, over, or under an environmentally sensitive area;

D. Graded Slopes and Fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed will require inspection and approval by the city, within 30 working days of completion of any ground cover, devices, or structures sufficient to restrain erosion; and

E. Ground Cover. Whenever land-disturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre, if more than one contiguous acre is uncovered, the person conducting the land-disturbing activity shall install such sedimentation and erosion control devices and practices as are sufficient to retain the sediment generated by the land-disturbing activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of the tract, and shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development within 30 working days or 120 calendar days following completion, whichever period is shorter.

F. Permits are not transferable. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.080 Permits – Exemptions.

The following activities are exempted, unless the excluded activity is to occur in an environmentally sensitive area:

A. Work authorized by a substantial development permit pursuant to the Shoreline Management Act and regulations presently enacted or as may be amended;

B. Excavations less than five feet in vertical depth or fills less than three feet in vertical depth and involving the removal, deposit, or displacement of not more than a total of 150 cubic yards of material throughout the life of the project from its condition;

C. Clearing of a parcel of land less than one acre;

D. The stockpiling or broadcasting of less than 500 cubic yards of topsoil, peat, sawdust, mulch, bark, chips, or solid nutrients on a lot, tract, or parcel of land per year;

E. The creation of impervious surfaces which have an area of less than 10,000 square feet;

However, if comments are not received within that time, the city will assume the external jurisdiction(s) has waived its right to comment. This provision may be superseded by the requirements of other state and federal permits.

F. The director may waive the requirement for plans or specifications if it finds that the information on the application is sufficient to show that proposed work will conform to the requirements of this chapter.

1. A waiver must not be construed as waiving the requirements of this or related regulations and the permittee remains bound by conditions of the application and regulations.

2. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the director requiring submission and approval of engineered clearing/filling/grading and erosion/sedimentation plans.

G. Utility construction may not take place in the city until an erosion/sedimentation plan is submitted to and approved by the director.

H. Within 60 days of receipt of the application (including required accompanying information and fee), the director shall review the application to determine if the requirements of this chapter are met. The director may request comments from other departments or agencies. If the requirements of this chapter are met, the director shall approve the plan, inform the applicant and issue a permit. If the conditions are not met, the director shall inform the applicant in writing and may either require needed information or disapprove the plan. Within 30 days of receipt of needed information, the director shall again determine if the plan meets the requirements of this chapter. If the plan is disapproved, the director shall inform the applicant in writing of the reasons for disapproval.

I. Applications for amendment of permit requirements in written and/or graphic form may be made at any time under the same conditions as the original application. Until such time as the amendment is approved by the city, the land-disturbing activity shall not proceed except in accordance with the permit as originally approved; provided, that:

1. The department may, in emergency situations and at its discretion, require the installation of interim erosion and sediment control measures to protect stream channels, other properties or the general public from damage, that will remain in effect until implemented;

2. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the director; provided, that those revisions are consistent with the requirements of this chapter and other related regulations and standards. The director shall establish a list of allowable field modifications for this purpose.

J. Decision Criteria. The permit authority may approve, or approve with modifications, an application submitted under this section only if due consideration has been given to the guidance contained in the comprehensive plan, and:

1. The proposal is in accord with the city basin plans, comprehensive drainage plan, and other city codes and adopted standards, regulations, and policies; and

2. The approval of the proposal will not pose a threat to be detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; and

3. The applicant has demonstrated that approval of the proposal is necessary for the reasonable development or maintenance of the property; and

4. Significant trees will be retained; and

5. The proposal is not in a sensitive area overlay district.

K. Time Limits May Be Imposed. For any permit authorized under this section, the permit authority may impose a time limit within which the proposed site work must be completed, generally not to exceed one year. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.220 Permit – Denial conditions.

A building permit may not be issued for any parcel or lot unless a land-disturbance permit has been approved or waived by the city as meeting all the requirements of this chapter. Where appropriate, such permits may not be issued without:

A. Approved drainage plan(s); and

B. Security. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.230 Permit – Additional conditions – Authorized when.

A. In granting any permit, the city may attach the conditions that it deems reasonably necessary to prevent sedimentation of public or private property, any sewer, storm drain, or watercourse, to prevent the operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property, or in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Those conditions may include the erection or installation of walls, drains, dams and structures, plantings, and erosion and sediment control measures or devices, furnishing necessary easements and a specified method of performing the work. These items must be identified on the erosion and sediment control plan submitted for approval. The following shall be conditions of all permits:

1. Notify the city within 48 hours of commencing any land-disturbing activity;

2. Notify the city of completion of any control measures within 48 hours after their installation;

3. Obtain permission in writing from the city prior to modifying the control plan;

4. Install all control measures as identified in the approved control plan;

5. Maintain all road drainage systems, storm water drainage systems, control measures, and other facilities identified in the control plan;

6. Repair any siltation or erosion damage to adjoining surfaces and drainage when resulting from land-developing or land-disturbing activities;

7. Inspect the construction control measures after each rain of one-half inches or more and at least once a week and make needed repairs;

8. Allow the community development director to enter the site for the purpose of inspecting compliance with the control plan or for performing any work necessary to bring the site into compliance with the control plan;

9. Keep a copy of the control plan on the site.

B. If, in the opinion of the director, the nature of the work is such that it may create a hazard to human life or endanger adjoining property, or property at a higher or lower elevation, or any street or street improvement, or any other public property, then the director may, before issuing the permit, require a certificate of insurance. That certificate must show that the applicant is insured against claims for damages for personal injury and property damage in an amount not less than $25,000. Those damages include damage to the city by depositing or washing material onto city streets or other public improvements, which may arise from or out of the performance of the work, whether the performance be by the applicant, the subcontractor of the applicant, or any person directly or indirectly employed by the applicant. The amount of the insurance must be prescribed by the director in accordance with the nature of the risk involved. Insurance must be written by a company licensed to do business in the state of Washington and approved by the city. Neither issuance of a permit nor compliance with these provisions or any condition imposed by the director relieves any person from any responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, or imposes any liability upon the city for damages to persons or property. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.240 Permit – Duration.

Permits shall be valid for a period of up to 180 days, or the length of the building permit or other construction authorizations, whichever is longer, from the date of issuance. The community development director may extend the period one or more times up to an additional 180 days. The director may require additional control measures as a condition of the extension if they are necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.250 Permit suspension and revocation – Conditions.

Any land-disturbance or building permit issued by the city may be suspended or revoked after written notice is given to the permittee for any of the following reasons:

A. Any violation(s) of the conditions of the land-disturbance permit;

B. Changes in site runoff characteristics upon which a waiver was granted;

C. Construction is not in accordance with the approved plans;

D. Noncompliance with correction notice(s) or stop-work order(s) issued for erosion or sediment controls;

E. An immediate danger exists in a downstream area or adjacent property, in the opinion of the city. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.260 Permit revocation and suspension – Procedure – Stop-work order.

A. Any permit issued under this chapter may be revoked or suspended by the community development director, after notice, for:

1. Violation of the plan or any other condition of the permit;

2. Violation of any provision of this chapter or any other applicable law, ordinance, rule, or regulation relating to the work;

3. Existence of any condition or the doing of any act constituting or creating a nuisance, hazard, or endangering human life or the property of others; or

4. Failure of the approved erosion and sediment control plan to achieve required erosion and sediment control objectives due to site characteristics or conditions.

B. In addition to the authority under subsection (A) of this section, the director may post a site with a stop-work order directing that all land-disturbing activity cease immediately; provided, that:

1. Written warning notice is furnished to the permittee or the representative of the permittee that lists corrective measures required and the time within which the corrections must be made; and

2. The permittee fails to comply with the warning notice within the specified time.

C. A stop-work order may be issued without warning notice where:

1. Land disturbance is taking place that requires a permit under this chapter and for which one has not been issued;

2. Required sediment control measures are not installed, inspected, and approved before the land disturbance; or

3. Inspection reveals the existence of any condition or the doing of any act that:

a. Is or creates a nuisance or hazard; or

b. Endangers human life or the property of others.

D. The department must provide written notice to the permittee or a representative of the permittee when a stop-work order is issued. That notice must specify the extent to which work is stopped and the conditions under which work may resume. The permittee is responsible for the actions of agents of the permittee and must notify those agents when a stop-work order is issued that will affect an area within which the agents are to work. In this application, “agent” is defined as any person who acts at the instruction, with the permission, or to the benefit of the permittee.

E. A person must not continue or permit the continuance of work in an area covered by a stop-work order, except work required to correct a sediment control violation.

F. This section must not be interpreted as restricting the department from proceeding directly with alternative enforcement procedures under this chapter.

G. The cost of any corrective measures shall be borne by the applicant. The director may require inspection and testing by an approved testing agency at any stage of the application or project. The inspection and testing shall beat minimum schedules as listed in the city’s development standards, or as published by the APWA/Washington State Department of Transportation or Washington State Department of Ecology. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.270 Waiver of permit requirements – Eligibility.

The city may grant a waiver of the permit requirements for individual developments; providing, that a written request is submitted by the applicant containing description, drawings, and any other information that is necessary to evaluate the proposed action. A separate written waiver request shall be required in accordance with the provisions of this section if there are subsequent additions, extensions, or modifications to a development receiving a waiver. Eligibility for a waiver shall be determined if the applicant can conclusively demonstrate that the proposed action will not cause an adverse impact on steep slopes, other properties, the public storm drainage system, or any other surface water. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.280 Variances.

The city may grant a written variance from any requirements of this chapter if there are exceptional circumstances applicable to the site such that strict adherence to the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship and not fulfill the intent of this chapter. A written request for variance shall be provided to the city and shall state the specific variance or variances sought and reasons for their granting. The city shall not grant a variance unless and until sufficient specific reasons justifying the variance are provided to the city. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.290 Clearing and grading.

A. Clearing. All clearing of vegetation shall conform to the specifications of this section and those set forth in the development standards unless such clearing qualifies as an exemption:

1. Minimum levels of existing vegetation shall be preserved or restored or replaced by approved landscaping;

2. Preservation and restoration requirements for vegetation shall be performed in accordance with guidelines and procedures set forth in the development standards;

3. No clearing shall be allowed in a protected area without a clearing and grading permit and such other approvals as may be required by the city. The limits of sensitive area setbacks and all other vegetation to be preserved shall be fenced during all construction-related activities as per the development standards prior to any clearing adjacent to a setback area or sensitive area;

4. No clearing shall be allowed in any designated native-growth protection easement or greenbelt without a permit and such other approvals as may be required by the city code. The limits of the native-growth protection easement or greenbelt shall be fenced during all construction-related activities as per the requirements of the development standards prior to any clearing adjacent to any such native-growth protection easement or greenbelt.

B. Grading. Changes in site topography shall conform to the following restrictions and those set forth in the development standards:

1. Fills in the regulatory floodway shall not be permitted;

2. The project shall be designed to minimize changes in grade, cleared areas, and volumes of excavation or fill;

3. The maximum surface gradient on any artificially created slope shall be two feet of horizontal run to one foot of vertical fall. The gradient may be increased to that gradient which can be demonstrated through engineering calculations as outlined in the development standards to be stable with a 1.5 factor of safety if, in the opinion of the community development director, it has been demonstrated by the applicant through engineering calculations that surface erosion can be controlled to that erosion rate equal to a two-to-one (2:1) slope under the same conditions;

4. The permittee shall at all times protect improvements to adjacent private properties and public rights-of-way or easements from damage during grading operations. The permittee shall restore public improvements damaged by his/her operations to the standards in effect at the time of the issuance of the permit.

C. Drainage. All clearing and grading activities shall conform to provisions of storm drainage plan approval. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.300 Oversizing.

When it is deemed necessary by the city as a condition of development for the developer to install conveyance lines larger than required to serve adjacent properties, such development shall be eligible for a payback or compensation for costs and expenses above those that would have resulted from the developer installing lines large enough for the developer’s development only. Such payback(s) shall be made to the developer only after development on any such adjacent properties takes place. Payback to the developer shall be made by the developer(s) of adjacent properties, and payback fees or charges shall be collected at the time of permitting of adjacent properties. Specific payback arrangements shall be legally established and agreed upon by the city in order for any such payback to be enforceable by the city. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.310 Inspection access.

Authorized representatives of the community development department may enter properties permitted under this chapter for the purpose of inspection and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.320 Inspection schedule and reports.

A. Prior to approval of a proposed land-disturbing activity, the developer will submit to the city a proposed inspection and construction control schedule. The city or its authorized representative shall conduct inspections and file reports for periodic inspections necessary during construction of storm water management systems to ensure compliance with the approved plans.

B. No work shall proceed until the city inspects and approves the work previously completed and furnishes the developer with the results of the inspection reports as soon as possible after completion of each required inspection.

C. Any portion of the work which does not comply will be promptly corrected by the developer, after written notice from the city. The notice shall set forth the nature of corrections required and the time within which corrections will be made.

D. The developer shall notify the city before commencing any work in conjunction with the storm water management plan and upon completion of the project when a final inspection will be conducted. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.330 Inspection requirements during construction.

A. A copy of the approved erosion and sediment control plan and the sediment control permit must be available on site for inspection by authorized representatives of the community development department.

B. Each site that has a designed erosion and sediment control plan must be inspected as necessary to ensure that sediment control measures are installed and effectively maintained in compliance with the approved plan and permit requirements. As a minimum, the permittee must obtain inspection by the department at the following stages:

1. Follow the installation of sediment control measures or practices and prior to any other land disturbance;

2. During the construction of sediment basins or storm water management structures, at the required inspection points;

3. During rough grading, including hauling of imported or wasted materials;

4. Prior to the removal or modification of any sediment control measure or practice; and

5. Upon completion of final grading, including established ground covers and planting, installation of all vegetative measures, and all other work in accordance with the approved plan.

C. If there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the department must inspect the work and notify the permittee, or the representative of the permittee, in writing. The notice issued must, as a minimum, state the nature of the violation, any practice or plan deficiencies, required corrective action, and compliance time. Any portion of the work that does not comply promptly must be corrected by the permittee. The department may make additional inspections as it deems necessary, and has the right to waive inspections, excluding the final inspection. The department must maintain a permanent record of each inspection.

Included must be the date, the location or project identification, whether or not the approved plan has been implemented and measures maintained, and, if a violation exists, the type of enforcement action taken.

D. When approved plans developed under the provisions of this chapter show the use of temporary basins or permanent storm water management structures, the department may require the submission of supportive documents such as test results, as-built plans, or material certifications. If necessary, in addition to its own inspections, the department may require that any portion of the construction of basins or structures be inspected and certified by a licensed professional engineer or land surveyor. At the community development director’s option, the permittee may secure the services of a licensed professional engineer or land surveyor to inspect the construction of the facilities and provide the department with a fully documented certification that all construction is done in accordance with the provisions of the approved plan, applicable rules, regulations, and specifications. If a certification is provided to the department, inspections required for that basin or structure may be waived. In these cases, the department must be notified at the time of the required inspection points and may make spot inspections.

E. All inspections and testing shall be determined prior to issuance of the permit, except those that may be required when conditions exist that were not covered in the documents submitted when requesting a permit. The director may require additional inspection or testing if conditions are found to be different than those presented in the plans or supporting documents; however, if and when conditions change, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant or the professional consultants who submitted the plans or documents to provide the director with recommended changes in procedures, for review and approval by the director. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.340 Final inspection reports.

A final inspection shall be conducted by the city upon completion of the elements of the land-disturbance permit to determine if the completed work is constructed in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. “As-built” certification by a registered professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington is also required to certify that the facility has been constructed as shown on the “as-built” plans and meets approved plans and specifications. The developer will receive written notification of the results of the final inspection. The city shall maintain a permanent file of inspection reports. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]

1. The date of inspection;

2. Name of inspector;

3. The condition of the control;

4. Description of needed maintenance.

C. If, after an inspection by the city, the condition of an erosion or sediment control measure presents an immediate danger to the public health or safety, because of an unsafe condition or improper maintenance, the city shall take such action as may be necessary to protect the public and make the facility safe. Any cost incurred by the city shall be assessed against the owner(s), as provided in CMC 15.28.360(C). [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.360 Maintenance agreement.

A. Prior to the issuance of any approval for which land-disturbance permit is required, the city shall require the applicant or owner to execute an inspection and maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the private storm drainage system. Such agreement shall provide for access to the system at reasonable times for regular inspection by the city or its authorized representative, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any provisions established.

B. The agreement shall be recorded by the applicant and/or owner in the land records of the city.

C. The agreement shall also provide that if, after notice by the city to correct a violation requiring maintenance work, satisfactory corrections are not made by the owner(s) within a reasonable period of time (30 days maximum), the city may perform all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. The owner(s) of the facility shall be assessed the cost of the work and any penalties, and there shall be a lien on the property, which may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the city. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.370 Maintenance responsibility.

A. The owner of the property on which work has been done pursuant to this chapter, or any other person or agent in control of such property, shall maintain in good condition and promptly repair and restore all grade surfaces, walls, drains, dams and structures, vegetation, erosion and sediment control measures, and other protective devices. Such repairs or restorations and maintenance shall be in accordance with approved plans.

B. A maintenance schedule shall be developed for the life of any storm drainage system element and shall state the maintenance to be completed, the time period for completion, and who shall perform the maintenance. This maintenance schedule shall be printed on the land-disturbance plan.

C. The maintenance and operation of private erosion and sediment controls shall be the responsibility of the property owner.

D. The city shall be responsible for the maintenance and operation of all public erosion and sediment controls located within the public easements and rights-of-way following the completion of a successful maintenance period and the acceptance of such facilities by the city. [Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.380 Hazard determination authority – Existing excavations – Notice to repair.

Whenever the community development director determines that any existing excavation or embankment or fill on private property has become a hazard to life and limb, or endangers property, or adversely affects the safety, use, or stability of a public way or drainage channel, the owner of the property upon which the excavation or fill is located, or other person or agency in control of the property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the building official, shall, within the period specified therein, repair or eliminate such excavation or embankment so as to eliminate the hazard and be in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.390 Determination of risk hazard – Current job site.

A. If the city, either upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site, determines that a significant risk of accelerated erosion or off-site sedimentation exists, the city will require a revised plan. Pending the preparation of the revised plan, work shall cease or shall continue under conditions outlined by the community development director.

B. Whenever the director determines that the act or intended act of clearing, grading, excavation, or fill has become or will constitute a hazard to life and limb, or endangers property, or adversely affects the safety, use, or stability of a public way, drainage channel, stream, or surface water, including siltation and sedimentation therein, the permit authority shall immediately suspend the clearing and grading permit. The permittee or other person or agent in control of the property, upon receipt of notice, in writing from the director, shall, within the period specified therein, terminate such clearing, grading, excavation, embankment or fill, or eliminate the same from the development plans, or modify the plans, and may be required so as to eliminate the hazard and be in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. The permittee shall also be required to take measures to correct damages caused to adjacent and/or downstream or upstream properties, under the direction of the permit authority, or if not accomplished in a reasonable period of time, the city shall do so using the security provided as part of the clearing and grading permit under which the work was done.

C. Immediately upon completion of the project, the permittee must notify the director and schedule a final inspection. If upon final inspection of the project the director finds that all work subject to inspection has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the permit, approved plans and specifications, rules and regulations, and that any supporting documents required herein are accepted, a completion certificate covering the work must be issued to the permittee by the director. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.400 Deposits of soil or other material prohibited.

A. A person must not engage in any land-disturbing activity or by any action cause or permit any soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material to be deposited upon or to roll, flow, or wash upon or over the premises of another in a manner to cause damage to the premises without the express written consent of the owner of the premises affected. A person must not engage in any land-disturbing activity or by any action cause or permit any soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material to be deposited or to roll, flow, or wash upon or over any public street, street improvement, road, sewer, storm drain, watercourse, right-of-way, or any public property in a manner to damage or to interfere with the use of that property.

B. A person must not, when hauling soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material over any public street, road, alley, or public property, allow materials to blow or spill over and upon any street, road, alley, or public property or adjacent private property.

C. If any soil, earth, sand, gravel, rock, stone, or other material is caused to be deposited upon or to roll, flow, or wash upon any public or private property in violation of subsections (A) and (B) of this section, the person responsible must be notified and must cause the material to be removed from that property within 24 hours. In the event of an immediate danger to the public health or safety, notice must be given by the most expeditious means and the material must be removed immediately. In the event it is not so removed, the community development department may cause the removal and the cost of that removal by the department must be paid to the city by the person who failed to remove the material. The cost of removal is a lien upon all property and all rights to property, real or personal, of any person liable to pay that cost. The cost of removal must be listed on the tax bill and must be collected in the manner of ordinary taxes; provided, however, that this section must not be interpreted as prohibiting the department from proceeding directly with alternative enforcement procedures set forth in this chapter. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.410 Appeals.

A. Any person aggrieved by the action of any official charged with the enforcement of this chapter, as the result of the disapproval of a properly filed application for a permit, issuance of a written notice of violation, or an alleged failure to properly enforce the chapter in regard to a specific application, shall have the right to appeal the action to the community development director. The appeal shall be filed in writing within 15 days of official transmittal of the final decision or determination to the applicant, and shall state clearly the grounds on which the appeal is based.

B. The director shall review the case file and written appeal information and may then approve any application, rescind any notice of violation, and/or in some other manner alter or modify the previous action or disposition as the director may determine appropriate. Appeals of decisions made by the director may be brought before the city manager who may direct the reevaluation of the appeal. Appeals beyond the city manager may then be brought before the city council. The decision of the city council shall be considered final. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.420 Liability limitations.

The community development director and other employees charged with the enforcement and administration of this policy, acting for the city in good faith and without malice in the discharge of their duties, shall not thereby render themselves liable personally for any damages which may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or by reason of any act or omission in the discharge of such duties. [Ord. 912B § 1, 2013; Ord. 454B, 1992.]


15.28.430 Violations and remedies.

A. The violation of or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter is declared to be unlawful. The remedies provided in this section, whether civil or criminal, shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy provided by law. The cumulative effects of a failure to abide by clearing, filling, and grading regulations is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of this community, and it is the desire and intent of the city council that the penalties contained in this section be strictly enforced without suspensions and deferrals of sentences except as may be necessary under exceptional circumstances to achieve substantial justice.

B. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activity has failed to comply with the approved plan, a notice of violation shall be served upon that person by registered or certified mail or other means. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan, specify a reasonable time period within which such measures must be completed, and warn that failure to correct the violation within the time period will result in the assessment of a civil penalty or other enforcement action. If the person engaged in land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, enforcement action shall be initiated.

C. Civil Remedies.

1. Any structures, work, facilities, excavations, fills, or other activities which are constructed, reconstructed, operated, or performed without a permit required by this chapter, or in violation of any lawful order or requirement of the permit authority made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated in the manner provided by the Chehalis Municipal Code.

2. Injunctive Relief.

a. Whenever the governing body has reasonable cause to believe that any person is violating or threatening to violate this chapter or any rule or other regulation adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or any term, condition, or provision of an approved clearing, filling, grading, or erosion and sedimentation control plan, it may, either before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this chapter, institute a civil action in the name of the city, for injunctive relief to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be brought in the municipal court.

b. Upon determination by a court that an alleged violation is occurring or is threatened, it shall enter such orders or judgements as are necessary to abate the violation or to prevent the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under this section shall not relieve any party to such proceedings from any civil or criminal penalty prescribed for violations of this chapter.

D. Civil Violation.

1. The violation of or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter, or of any lawful order or requirement of the permit authority made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, is a civil violation. The provisions of the municipal code shall be used to enforce this chapter in addition to other procedures authorized by this chapter.

2. It shall not be a defense to the prosecution for failure to obtain a permit required by this chapter that a contractor, subcontractor, person with responsibility on the site, or person authorizing or directing the work believed that a permit had been issued to the property owner or any other person unless that belief was verified in writing by the permit authority prior to commencement of the work.

3. In addition, any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be required to abate any conditions on the subject property in a manner which will achieve full compliance with this chapter and/or restore such property to its original condition, as nearly as practicable.

4. The permit authority shall have authority to withhold issuance of a permit or revoke a permit already issued to any contractor or to the person cited for performing work in violation of this chapter and to not issue or reissue permits for further clearing or grading upon the site unless all security deemed necessary by the permit authority and authorized by CMC 15.28.260 is established or reestablished.

E. Criminal Penalties. Any person who knowingly or willfully violates any provision of this chapter, or rule or other regulation adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or who knowingly or willfully initiates or continues a land-disturbing activity for which an erosion control plan is required, except in accordance with the terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or by a fine not to exceed $5,000, or by both, in the discretion of the court.

17.03.010 Title.

This title shall be known as the uniform development regulations for the city of Chehalis, and may be referred to as the development regulations or development standards, critical areas ordinance, floodplain ordinance, zoning code, zoning standards, subdivision ordinance, shoreline master program, shoreline development regulations and/or SEPA ordinance, as appropriate. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.020 Purpose.

A. To implement the comprehensive plan including providing for adequate light, air, access and open space for all development; enhance safety from fire and other dangers; require adequate provisions for essential public services; provide for the availability of essential public facilities; and create a balance between maximum flexibility in the use of land and providing high quality development for the health, safety, and welfare of the community.

B. To classify all land within the city and the urban growth area (UGA) into regular and special land use zones, and within each zone, regulating the uses and structures as appropriate, and requiring specific amenities to accomplish the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan.

C. To regulate, control and manage hazardous waste; plan for and manage the release of hazardous substances; promote the reduction of hazardous waste; and encourage the recycling of hazardous waste.

D. To ensure that environmental concerns are discussed during the development review process, and that the decisions relating to development reflect adopted environmental values. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.030 Scope.

A. The provisions of this title shall apply, as specified herein, to any and all development, construction, use of property, use of buildings and any other activity which impacts or involves the provision of government services.

B. The granting or approval of any permit or license, or the exemption of any activity from such permit or license, shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind, sort or nature by the city, or any elected or appointed official or employee thereof, as to the practicality, safety, appropriateness, viability, feasibility, or risk associated with any use, building or structure and such granting or exemption shall create no liability whatsoever, nor any cause of action against the city or any official or employee thereof, for any direct or consequential damage that may result from such activity.

C. The provisions of this title shall be interpreted and construed to be minimum standards. Nothing herein shall prevent a permit holder from exceeding the minimum standards unless such activity otherwise violates any provision of this title. Where a conflict may occur between two or more standards adopted by this title, the most restrictive or that requirement imposing the higher standard shall prevail.

D. The administration and enforcement of this title shall not include civil agreements for which the city is not a contractual party. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.040 Fees.

A. Any application for any license, permit, or approval required by this title shall have attached thereto the required application fee, if any, specified in Appendix Chapter A. No application will be considered complete unless the required fee, if any, is attached thereto.

B. Any license, permit or approval which has been officially approved by the city shall have the required permit fee, if any, specified in Appendix Chapter A submitted prior to issuance of the license, permit or approval. No license, permit or approval will be issued until the required fee, if any, is submitted. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.050 Existing conforming buildings/structures.

A. Any building or structure which was lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title shall be allowed to be repaired and maintained to its existing status without regard for the provisions of this title, provided such repair or maintenance shall comply with any applicable provisions of the building code.

B. Any addition, substantial remodel, substantial repair, or demolition of all or part of any building or structure which was lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title shall comply with all applicable provisions of this title.

17.03.060 Existing conforming uses.

A. Any use or occupancy of a building, structure, and/or property which was lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title may continue such use or occupancy in the same manner and status without regard for the provisions of this title.

B. Any change in use or occupancy of a building, structure, or property from that which was lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title shall comply with all applicable provisions of this title.

C. Any existing use or occupancy of a building, structure, or property which violated any applicable law, ordinance, code, rule, or regulation prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title shall acquire no vested rights, and may be abated upon discovery of such violation by the city. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.070 Change in use or occupancy.

A. No existing use or occupancy shall be changed or altered so as to constitute a different occupancy group in the International Building Code (IBC) without approval of the development review committee (DRC). Such approval shall require an application to the administrator for such change, and an inspection by the DRC of the premises proposed to be changed or altered.

B. Any change in use or occupancy shall be made to comply with any applicable provisions of this title, including, but not limited to, CMC 17.09.110 and 17.09.115, conditional use, the adopted uniform codes and the adopted development engineering standards.

C. Any change in use or occupancy of any property which has not been approved by the DRC, and which violates any provision of this title, shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be abated as provided in CMC 7.04.130. Any cost to the city occasioned by such unlawful use or occupancy shall be recovered by placing a lien on such property or other such method as may be applicable and effective. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.080 Existing nonconforming buildings/structures.

A. Any nonconforming building or structure which was lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title may continue such existence; provided, that no fire, life/safety or sanitation hazard exists within such building or structure.

B. Any nonconforming building or structure which was unlawfully created by action or acquiescence shall not acquire any vested rights by virtue of any provision of this title. Upon discovery of such a building or structure, the DRC shall require abatement of any unlawful construction as provided in CMC 17.09.160.

C. An existing nonconforming building or structure shall be maintained and/or repaired so as to not constitute a substandard building or structure as defined in the Uniform Housing Code (UHC).

D. Any addition, substantial alteration, or substantial repair performed on an existing lawful nonconforming building or structure shall require such work to conform to the applicable provisions of this title; provided, if the only aspect of nonconformance is a building or structure setback, such work may proceed at the same building or structure setback as currently exists as long as all other applicable requirements of this title are accomplished.

E. If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy such that the cost of repair of the building or structure to its status prior to the damage is less than 50 percent of the value of the building or structure prior to the damage, such repair may be made without full compliance with the requirements of this title, provided:

1. A development permit is obtained and compliance with applicable provisions of the adopted uniform codes is accomplished; and

2. Any fire, life/safety and/or sanitation hazard that may have existed shall be corrected.

F. If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged by fire, explosion, willful demolition or removal, act of God, or act of the public enemy such that the cost of repair or replacement of the building or structure to its status prior to the damage is 50 percent or more of the value of the building or structure prior to the damage, such building or structure shall be brought into compliance with all applicable provisions of this title, provided the owner of such property may request specific relief from this requirement for cause through a variance application.

G. Any building or structure for which a completed development permit application has been submitted prior to the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, and which does not comply with all applicable provisions of this title, shall be reviewed for consistency with the development regulations that were effective prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title, and shall be considered a nonconforming building or structure under this title. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.090 Existing nonconforming uses.

A. Any nonconforming use which was lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title may continue such existence; provided, that no identified public nuisance is created by such use.

B. Any nonconforming use which was unlawfully created by action or acquiescence shall not acquire any vested rights by virtue of any provision of this title. Upon discovery of such a use, the administrator shall require abatement of any unlawful use as provided in CMC 17.09.160.

C. An existing nonconforming category of use (use code) shall not be converted, changed in category of use or occupancy, significantly altered or otherwise made increasingly nonconforming. Such a use may apply for a conditional use permit for such an increase.

D. Any existing nonconforming use which is discontinued from a premises for any reason for more than 90 days shall be considered vacated, provided:

1. Any proposed reoccupancy of a vacated use may be permitted by the DRC if the reoccupancy consists of the same category of use (use code) that was vacated, and no development permit is required for such reoccupancy to comply with building or fire codes for the proposed use. A new certificate of occupancy is required for such reoccupancy;

2. Any proposed reoccupancy of a vacated use must obtain a conditional use permit if the reoccupancy is not the same category of use (use code) that was vacated, or if any development permit would be required for such reoccupancy to comply with building or fire codes for the proposed use.

E. An existing nonconforming use which proposes to relocate from one premises to another shall comply with all applicable requirements for the “new” premises. No vested rights of the nonconforming use may be transferred to another premises. [Ord. 785B § 11, 2005; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.100 Existing conditional uses.

Any conditional use of record shall be subject to the requirements of CMC 17.03.090 except where adoption of this title has caused such use to become permitted. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]

B. Damaged buildings and structures may be repaired consistent with CMC 17.03.050 or 17.03.080 (existing conforming/nonconforming buildings or structures).

C. Dilapidated buildings and structures, upon receiving an abatement notice from the city, shall be repaired or demolished consistent with this title and the adopted building and fire codes.

D. Repair or demolition of damaged or dilapidated buildings and structures shall be commenced within 14 days of the date of any abatement notice issued by the city, provided:

2. The development review committee may require an immediate repair or demolition if any safety hazard or any imminent threat to life or safety is identified.

E. Any damaged or dilapidated building or structure which is not repaired or demolished within the required time limits established in the building permit issued for such project shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be abated by the city.

(See also CMC 7.04.130, nuisance abatement, and CMC 17.09.160.) [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.109 Urban growth area – Acquisition/revision.

A. Lewis County may approve additions or revisions to the Chehalis urban growth area (UGA) pursuant to their authority under the Growth Management Act (GMA). The county must determine the process, scheduling, procedure and required elements of any proposal for any additions to, or alteration of, any UGA, and advise the cities of their procedure and requirements. The county currently uses the planned growth committee to review UGA proposals, but the county may change their process in the future.

B. Any petition for addition or alteration of any Chehalis UGA must be submitted to the city prior to the last day of a calendar year for review and decision by the city and the county the following calendar year. This schedule may be revised by the county at their discretion and authority. A petitioner is encouraged to determine the county’s requirements for petitions to amend a UGA prior to any submittal.

C. Any petition for amendment to any Chehalis UGA must be accompanied by the required needs analysis as determined by the county. The county should determine the nature and content of a needs analysis under the GMA and make guidance documents available for use by the public and the city.

D. If a petition for amendment to a UGA is submitted by the city, the required needs analysis shall be accomplished by the city and attached to the petition. If a petition for amendment to a UGA is submitted by a citizen or group of citizens, the required needs analysis shall be performed by a qualified consultant at the discretion of the citizen or group and attached to the petition.

E. The city shall make available copies of all existing specific data relating to a needs analysis performed by a consultant when requested. The city shall not be required to generate data for any needs analysis unless the city determines that it is in the best interest of the city to do so.

F. The city will present any petitions for amendment to the Chehalis UGA to the county as required through the applicable county process, including public hearings, but the needs analysis and any additional information required by the county shall be the responsibility of the petitioner. Any decision made by the county in the review and approval or denial of any UGA petition may only be appealed as provided in the GMA. [Ord. 819B § 4, 2007.]


17.03.110 Urban growth area.

A. Each parcel of real property within the city’s adopted urban growth area (UGA) shall be designated with one of the regular land use zones identified in Division V of this title.

B. Each parcel of real property within the city’s adopted UGA shall be designated with one or more environmental districts identified in Division III of this title if such property satisfies the applicable criteria for such designation.

C. Each parcel of real property within the city’s adopted UGA may be designated with one or more special districts identified in Division IV of this title if such property satisfies the applicable criteria for such designation.

D. In the case of additional properties added to the city’s UGA by Lewis County, or official action of the growth hearings board, and where a specific land use zone has not been incorporated into the official action adding such property to the UGA, the “default” land use zone shall be:

1. R-1, single-family residential zone, for each such parcel which has been designated for residential development;

2. C-G, general commercial zone, for each such parcel which has been designated for commercial development;

3. I-L, light industrial zone, for each such parcel which has been designated for industrial development.

E. At such time as Lewis County, or the growth hearings board, may designate, reduce, enlarge or otherwise amend or alter the city’s UGA, the official map of such UGA shall be amended to reflect the city’s zoning designations consistent with subsection (A), (B), (C) or (D) of this section.

F. Any action of the county or the hearings board relating to the city’s adopted UGA which causes any inconsistency between the UGA, the comprehensive plan or this title shall be corrected as provided in CMC 17.09.140, Amendments/rezones, and the administrator shall be the petitioner under such circumstance.

G. Any proposal to change any land use zoning designation, including any prior zoning designation or any “default” zoning designation by any party including the city shall be submitted as provided in CMC 17.09.140, Amendments/rezones.

H. No land use zoning designation by the city relating to any real property in the UGA shall have any effect on any development proposal therein except:

1. Utility extensions or connections to the city’s utilities shall be permitted only for uses or development consistent with the city’s designated land use zoning;

2. Upon receipt of an annexation petition, the subject area shall be considered zoned for development purposes until such annexation proposal is officially approved or denied;

3. When an interlocal agreement or other contract, or any applicable law or statute, causes such zoning designation to be applicable and specifies the conditions of applicability. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.120 Annexations.

A. Annexation of property to the city shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW).

B. Annexed property shall be designated with one of the regular land use zones identified in Division V of this title as a part of the annexation process.

C. Annexed property shall be designated with one or more environmental districts identified in Division III of this title if such property satisfies the applicable criteria for such designation as a part of the annexation process.

D. Annexed property may be designated with one or more special districts identified in Division IV of this title if such property satisfies the applicable criteria for such designation as a part of the annexation process.

E. Nothing herein shall preclude the city council from specifying other conditions of approval for any annexation proposal to accomplish the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.03.125 The common law practice of vesting.

A. A valid and fully complete building permit application for a structure that is permitted under the zoning or other land use control ordinances in effect on the date of the application shall be considered under the building permit ordinance in effect at the time of application, and the zoning or other land use control ordinances in effect on the date of application. In accordance with RCW 4.04.010, any other statutory codification of the vested rights doctrine limits the common law interpretation and application of such doctrine.

B. The requirements for a fully completed application shall be defined by the Chehalis Municipal Code but for any construction project costing more than $5,000 the application shall include, at a minimum:

1. The legal description, or the tax parcel number assigned pursuant to RCW 84.40.160, and the street address if available, and may include any other identification of the construction site by the prime contractor;

2. The property owner’s name, address, and phone number;

3. The prime contractor’s business name, address, phone number, current state contractor registration number; and

4. Either:

a. The name, address, and phone number of the office of the lender administering the interim construction financing, if any; or

b. The name and address of the firm that has issued a payment bond, if any, on behalf of the prime contractor for the protection of the owner, if the bond is for an amount not less than 50 percent of the total amount of the construction project.

C. The information required on the building permit application by subsections (B)(1) through (4) of this section shall be set forth on the building permit document which is issued to the owner, and on the inspection record card which shall be posted at the construction site.

D. The information required by subsection (B) of this section and information supplied by the applicant after the permit is issued under subsection (E) of this section shall be kept on record in the office where building permits are issued and made available to any person on request. If a copy is requested, a reasonable charge may be made as established by council.

E. If any of the information required by subsection (D) of this section is not available at the time the application is submitted, the applicant shall so state and the application shall be processed forthwith and the permit issued as if the information had been supplied, and the lack of the information shall not cause the application to be deemed incomplete for the purposes of vesting under subsection (A) of this section. However, the applicant shall provide the remaining information as soon as the applicant can reasonably obtain such information.

F. The limitations imposed by this section shall not restrict conditions imposed under Chapter 43.21C RCW.

G. Unless amended or terminated, a development agreement is enforceable during its term by a party to the agreement. A development agreement and the development standards in the agreement govern during the term of the agreement, or for all or that part of the build-out period specified in the agreement, and may not be subject to an amendment to a zoning ordinance or development standard or regulation or a new zoning ordinance or development standard or regulation adopted after the effective date of the agreement. A permit or approval issued by the county or city after the execution of the development agreement must be consistent with the development agreement. In accordance with RCW 4.04.010 nothing in this section nor any other statutory codification of the vested rights doctrine limits the common law interpretation and application of such doctrine.

H. A proposed division of land, as defined in RCW 58.17.020, shall be considered under the subdivision or short subdivision ordinance, and zoning or other land use control ordinances, in effect on the land at the time a fully completed application for preliminary plat approval of the subdivision, or short plat approval of the short subdivision, has been submitted to the appropriate county, city, or town official. In accordance with RCW 4.04.010, neither subsection (A) of this section nor any other statutory codification of the vested rights doctrine limits the common law interpretation and application of such doctrine. [Ord. 951B § 1, 2016.]


17.03.130 Severability.

The provisions of this title are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, part, or portion of this title, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this title, nor the validity of any application thereof. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]

E. The DRC is an administrative committee comprised of the members of the departments who are responsible for issuance of a variety of permits and licenses, and enforcement of numerous federal, state, and local codes and ordinances. Because of this structure, the DRC may suggest the holding of permit approval until further information can be acquired, or may suggest the denial of an application. The final decision rests with the member of the responsible department having the statutory authority to issue permits or licenses, or enforce federal, state, or local codes and ordinances.

F. Any conditions of approval made by the member of the responsible department must be stated and conveyed to the applicant in statutory and definitive terms. The terms “shall,” “must,” or “will” must be included in any conditioning statement. The terms “should” or “may” will not be considered mandatory in any approval process, and will generally suggest or recommend alternatives to the proposal as submitted. Any conditions applied to any permit or license approved by any department are the responsibility of that department for enforcement. A building permit may contain conditioning statements for the fire marshal, for example, but the fire marshal is responsible for enforcing them under the fire marshal’s statutory authority. Typically, the only time that a permit from one department will contain conditions of another department is when the conditioning department does not have a permitting process, but does have requirements relevant to the proposal. At the DRC meeting, the appropriate conditions on the appropriate permit shall be determined.

G. Nothing which is accomplished at any DRC meeting shall preclude any department from independent permitting, approval or enforcement activities within their statutory authority. In the event that any department desires to condition any permit, but neglects to do so at a DRC meeting, that department may independently pursue any appropriate method of obtaining compliance with the regulations of the city.

H. The plan review process is designed to be a comprehensive analysis of a development proposal to determine whether or not the development, if constructed or implemented, will comply with the city’s regulations. When a plan or blueprint is submitted, it must be approved as presented, conditioned in some manner based on a specific regulation or denied because of noncompliance. The DRC may need to refer to a set of standards or performance criteria, but generally must analyze the drawings and tell the applicant specifically what corrections need to be made in order to comply. The DRC will not design the project, but only require changes to the submitted proposal. In cases where the information is missing or unclear on the drawing or print, the DRC may then refer to some standard or criteria, or dictate exactly what must be done as a conditioning statement.

I. The fire department and police department issue fire code permits and parking permits; the community development department issues permits for clearing, filling, grading, right-of-way and various other approvals; the community development department issues permits for building, zoning (land use), flood hazard zone, Shoreline Management Act, SEPA approvals and various other permits and approvals. Each of these permitting systems has been designed to address specific or unique issues related to any development proposal and is administered by the department having the related expertise. Any development proposal may be exempt from any of these permit systems, or may be under the jurisdiction of all of them.

J. It is the responsibility of the DRC to determine which permit system an applicant is exempt from and so document using the appropriate method of the applicable department, and which permit or approval system must be applied to the proposal. Some permitting systems such as SEPA and SMA require that state forms be used. [Ord. 912B § 3, 2013; Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 810B § 6, 2006; Ord. 769B § 8, 2004; Ord. 767B, 2004; Ord. 766B, 2004; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.080 Development codes.

A. Pursuant to the State Building Code Act (Chapter 19.27A RCW), certain codes, rules, and regulations, as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, supplemented or added to, shall be, and the same hereby are, adopted by reference, including additions, deletions, and amendments to the codes (Chapters 51-40 through 51-47 WAC); the Washington State Energy Code (Chapter 51-11 WAC); the Washington State Historic Building Code (Chapter 51-19 WAC); and the Washington State Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality Code (Chapter 51-13 WAC), which are promulgated by the Washington State Building Code Council. In addition, certain code appendices and specialized codes are also adopted by reference. Such codes, rules, and regulations are enumerated in Appendix Chapter E and are adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein.

B. In the event of conflict between provisions of the codes, rules, or regulations enumerated in Appendix Chapter E, the first-named code, rule, or regulation shall govern over those following, except as provided in Chapter 51-40 WAC (Building Code).

C. One copy each of the above-referenced codes shall be available for public reference in the office of the city building official. [Ord. 819B § 6, 2007; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.090 Development engineering standards.

A. Any and all development which occurs upon or abutting a public right-of-way, and any and all development which involves any extension, connection, or any other direct or indirect association with any water, wastewater and/or storm water utility component, and/or any land-disturbing activity shall comply with the development engineering standards. Such standards are specified in the development engineering standards, and are applicable as determined by the director of public works or designated consultant.

B. Nothing herein shall preclude the director of public works from specifying standards different than those contained in the development engineering standards based on best available information and technology; provided, that the reasons and justification for such alternative standards are made a matter of record at a DRC meeting, and that equivalency is obtained through the use of such alternative standards in the particular circumstance. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.100 Development permits required.

A. Except for specific exempted activity defined in the adopted building code, and/or defined in the development engineering standards, no development, earthwork, utility work, subdivision, building, structure, building usage, property usage, or other similar activity regulated by this title shall be initiated, erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, improved, removed, converted, or demolished unless a development permit and/or certificate of occupancy is issued by the city for such activity.

B. Application for a development permit shall be on forms specified by the city, and shall contain the information required for review by the city. Required information shall include, but not be limited to, that information specified in the building code relating to building permits, and that information specified in the development engineering standards relating to utility and/or right-of-way development activity. In addition, development within environmental districts or special districts will require specialized information or required meetings with the DRC relating to such a district. Such information shall also be submitted for review whenever applicable.

C. The DRC shall determine if such application is exempt from a development permit and, if so, such application shall be reviewed as an application for a certificate of occupancy. The DRC shall document such exemption in the permanent file for the subject address.

D. Prior to issuance of any development permit, the DRC shall determine that water and sewer utility service is physically provided to the frontage, or other approved location, of the subject property. Upon approval of the required civil plan for any public utility infrastructure, the DRC may accept a bond or other guarantee approved by the city attorney for said infrastructure in lieu of said infrastructure being installed, inspected, approved and accepted by the city. The DRC will not issue any final approval of any development permit until such infrastructure is completed and accepted by the city.

E. The DRC may place a development permit application on hold pending resolution of any abatement activity filed on the subject property or use. Unresolved abatement processes shall be cause for the DRC to deny proposed development activity for failure to comply with applicable city regulations.

F. Failure of an applicant to submit required information within 30 days of a written notice to do so shall constitute an abandoned application, and shall therefore acquire no vested rights.

G. Nothing herein shall preclude an applicant from requesting that the city issue a development permit for exempt activity. Such a request shall be reviewed as if it were a required permit application. [Ord. 847B § 9, 2009; Ord. 819B §§ 7, 13, 2007; Ord. 750B § 2, 2003; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.105 Agency permits required.

A. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant for any development activity to determine whether or not any other government agency, or any agency with contracted jurisdiction, has any permit or approval requirements for the proposed development.

B. Issuance of a development permit by the city shall not relieve the applicant of any obligation or responsibility to comply with applicable requirements of any other agency with jurisdiction over the proposal. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.110 Special use permits/variance – Process.

A. Although each zone is primarily intended for a predominant type of use (e.g., dwellings in residential districts), there are a number of uses which may or may not be appropriate in a particular zone depending upon all the circumstances of the individual case. Also, there are uses which because of their temporary nature cannot be properly classified in any particular zone without individual consideration of impact of those uses upon the neighboring land and of the public need for the particular uses. Such special circumstances are addressed through the conditional use permit, planned unit development (PUD), and variance processes described in this chapter.

B. Any person desiring a conditional use permit, temporary or special use permit, PUD, or a variance from any requirement of this title shall file an application with the administrator on a form provided by the city. Accuracy and completeness of the application shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Such filing shall be accompanied by the filing fee specified in Appendix Chapter A. The administrator shall review the application and transmit the application to the examiner or the planning commission as applicable and set the date for a public hearing on the application. Such public hearing must be held, with notice as provided in CMC 17.09.130, within 90 days following the filing of a complete application. The examiner or planning commission shall approve, approve with conditions, modify, or deny the application within 30 days after conclusion of the public hearing, and shall state their or its findings of fact, conclusions, and decisions in writing. These findings and conclusions shall relate specifically to each of the conditions specified in CMC 17.09.115 and/or 17.09.120. The examiner or planning commission approval of the application shall constitute authorization and direction to the administrator to issue a permit for the conditional use, PUD or variance. Failure of any person to appeal any decision of the examiner or planning commission shall constitute acceptance of the decision made on the record.

C. Any complete application submitted prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title shall be heard and decided by the board of zoning adjustment; provided, if the board is unable to act on any such application for any reason, it shall be transmitted to the hearing examiner for a hearing and determination. Any change in venue of any application during the transition from board to examiner pursuant to this title shall not affect any vested status of such application. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.115 Conditional use/planned unit development (PUD).

A. A permit to allow a conditional use or a planned unit development (PUD) may be approved when:

1. The use proposed in the application is not listed on the zoning use chart, CMC 17.78.020, or any special or environmental district use criteria (Divisions III and IV of this title) as a prohibited use in the zone or district in which the proposed use would be located; and

2. The procedures set forth in CMC 17.09.130, notice, have been followed; and

3. The examiner or planning commission has found that the proposed use is consistent with the objectives and purposes of this title and with the comprehensive plan; and

4. The examiner or planning commission has found that the proposed use is compatible with surrounding land uses and with the general character of the district in which it would be located; and

5. In the case of a conditional use permit allowing the continuance or reestablishment of a nonconforming use:

a. The nonconforming use possessed substantial value at the time of discontinuance; and

b. The owner can demonstrate substantial hardship if the conditional use is denied; and

c. No violations of this title nor any public nuisance would be created by the proposal if approved; and

d. The overall community will not be materially damaged by grant of the permit.

B. In considering an application for a conditional use permit or a PUD:

1. If the proposed use is identified in the zoning use chart, CMC 17.78.020; the shoreline master program (SMP) (Chapter 17.18 CMC and Appendix Chapter R); or any special district (Division IV of this title) as a listed conditional use, the burden to demonstrate that the proposal should be denied rests with the public;

2. If the proposed use is not identified in any use chart in this title as a listed conditional use, the burden to demonstrate that the proposal should be approved rests with the applicant.

C. In considering an application for a conditional use or PUD, the examiner or planning commission may impose modifications or conditions on the application necessary to ensure compliance with this title and the comprehensive plan. Such modifications or conditions may relate to the following:

1. Size and location of the site;

2. Street and road capacities in the area;

3. Ingress and egress to adjoining public streets;

4. Location and amount of off-street parking;

5. Internal traffic circulation system;

6. Fencing, screening, and landscaped buffer areas;

7. Building bulk and location;

8. Usable open space;

9. Signs and lighting;

10. Drainage of storm water;

11. Noise, vibration, air pollution and other environmental influences; and

12. Other pertinent factors.

D. All approved site plans relating to conditional uses and PUDs, including modifications and conditions, shall be made a part of the permanent address file and any development permit for the property.

E. No approved conditional use permit or PUD may be modified, enlarged, or expanded in ground area unless the site plan is amended and approved in accordance with any variance procedures applicable to such proposal.

F. A conditional use permit approved by the examiner and issued by the administrator shall expire 90 days from the date of issuance if no substantial activity has occurred to implement the approved proposal. A PUD approved by the planning commission shall expire 180 days from the date of approval if no substantial activity has occurred to implement the approved proposal. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.120 Variance.

A. Where unnecessary hardships or practical difficulties resulting from peculiarities of a specific property render it difficult or inequitable to carry out all provisions of this title, the examiner shall have the authority to grant a variance if all the following conditions are met:

1. The variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon development of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which subject property is located; and

2. Such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with development rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located; provided, that such unusual circumstances or conditions have not been created by action or acquiescence of the applicant; and

3. The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; and

4. The granting of such a variance will not be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan; and

5. The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of any adjacent property.

B. An application for a variance shall be accompanied by a written statement as to how the request is consistent with subsection (A) of this section and the burden of demonstrating such consistency lies with the applicant. In authorizing a variance, the examiner or planning commission may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of the proposed structures or uses as it may deem necessary to carry out the intent of this title.

C. Unless another time limit is established during the approval process, a variance so authorized shall become void after 90 days if no substantial construction has taken place in accordance with the plans for which the variance was authorized. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.130 Public hearings.

A. Notice of the time, date, place, and purpose of any public hearing required to be held before the city council, commission, hearing examiner, or the DRC shall be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation available in the area involved in the subject hearing, or as required in CMC 17.12.140 (subdivisions), 17.15.220 (SEPA) or 17.18.040 (shorelines). Such publication shall occur at least 10 days prior to the date of the subject hearing.

B. If the subject of a hearing does not involve a site-specific activity, such notice shall also be faxed or otherwise delivered to local radio stations which broadcast local news.

C. If the subject of a hearing does involve a site-specific activity, such notice shall also be mailed to the owner of record of any property within 300 feet of the boundary of the subject property. The administrator shall ascertain the listing of tax parcel numbers from the Lewis County assessor’s plat map, and the owners of record listed in the Lewis County assessor’s office. Whenever an owner’s mailing address does not match the situs address for the tax parcel number, an additional notice will be mailed to the occupant at the situs address. Such mailing shall be accomplished by the administrator, and the filing fee associated with any application which requires a public hearing shall recover the cost of such mailing, including staff time.

D. Failure of the administrator to send notice to any person specified to receive such notice, or failure of any person to receive such notice for any reason, shall not invalidate any proceeding associated with the subject application, and shall not constitute a cause of action against the city; provided, that substantial conformance with the notice requirement has been accomplished, and said notice has been published as required in subsection (A) of this section. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.140 Amendments/rezones.

A. The provisions of this title and/or the adopted comprehensive plan may be amended during the second quarter of any calendar year except as provided in subsection (C) of this section. Any agency or any taxpayer may petition the city for an amendment to this title and/or the comprehensive plan. If such a petition involves a rezoning of any property within the city or its UGA, the petitioner must hold a legal ownership interest in at least one tax parcel of property within any area submitted for rezoning.

B. A petition for any amendment to this title or the comprehensive plan shall be submitted on forms provided by the administrator (Appendix Chapter B), received by the city between February 1st and March 31st of any calendar year, and be accompanied by any required filing fee (Appendix Chapter A). Only one subject, area, or section shall be submitted per form, but there is no limit to the number of forms that may be submitted. Nothing herein shall preclude the filing of a petition at any other time of year; however, the city shall take no formal action on such a petition until the February 1st following receipt of such a filing.

C. This title and/or the comprehensive plan may be amended at any time to comply with any statutory requirements mandated by state and/or federal law. An emergency shall be deemed to exist if failure to amend this title may result in any sanction to the city from any source.

D. A completed petition for amendment shall be reviewed by the DRC, and any comments or recommendations made by the DRC shall be attached to the petition.

E. The petition and any comments or recommendations made by the DRC shall be forwarded by the administrator to the planning commission. The planning commission shall conduct a public hearing on such petition and make a recommendation thereon. The petition and planning commission recommendation shall be forwarded to the city council for consideration.

F. The city council shall conduct a public hearing on the petition and the planning commission recommendation, and approve, modify, or deny such petition.

G. A petition for a rezone of specific property shall be considered an amendment to this title, and such a petition for rezone shall conform to all applicable provisions of this title, including this section.

H. For the purpose of establishing and maintaining sound, stable, and desirable development within the city, the rezoning of land is to be discouraged and allowed only under certain circumstances as provided in this section. This policy is based on the opinion of the city council that the map is the result of a detailed and comprehensive appraisal of the city’s present and future needs regarding land use allocation and, as such, should not be amended unless to correct a manifest error or because of changed or changing conditions in a particular area or the city in general. Rezoning shall only be allowed if the petitioner demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that:

1. The land to be rezoned was initially zoned in error and as presently zoned is inconsistent with the policies and goals of the comprehensive plan; or

2. Conditions in the area for which rezoning is requested have changed or are changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area; or

3. The proposed rezoning is necessary in order to provide land for a community-related use which was not anticipated at the time of the adoption of the comprehensive plan, and that such rezoning will be consistent with the policies of the comprehensive plan. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.150 Appeals.

A. Any administrative appeal of any decision made by the city’s responsible official under SEPA shall be filed with the examiner as specified in CMC 17.15.270 and 17.15.280.

B. Any judicial appeal of any decision made by the city’s responsible official under SEPA shall not be allowed.

C. Any administrative appeal of any decision made by the examiner shall not be allowed.

D. Any judicial appeal of any decision made by the examiner shall be filed with Lewis County superior court as specified by the court.

E. Any administrative appeal of any decision made by the planning commission shall be filed with the city council. The form of appeal shall be substantially consistent with subsection (J) of this section, and be filed with the director of community development. The city council shall conduct a closed record appeal hearing on any such appeal filed, and uphold, modify, or overturn the decision of the planning commission. The conduct and decision on any such appeal shall be consistent with subsections (L) and (M) of this section.

F. Any judicial appeal of any decision made by the planning commission shall not be allowed.

G. Any administrative appeal of any decision made by the city council shall not be allowed.

H. Any judicial appeal of any decision made by the city council shall be filed with either the Lewis County superior court or the Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board, as may be appropriate and applicable to the specific circumstance, as specified by the court or the board. It shall be the responsibility of the appellant to identify the required venue.

I. Any administrative appeal of any decision made by any member of the DRC shall be as follows:

1. The applicant must request in writing to the DRC an appeal of a particular or specific requirement which has been conveyed to them as a condition or requirement of their project approval. The applicant must also request a particular date to present their appeal to the DRC; the date must be a regular meeting date of the DRC at least 10 days from the date of the appeal;

2. At the scheduled meeting, the applicant must explain to the DRC why the condition or requirement should not be placed on the project. The DRC member who placed the condition or requirement on the project must cite the statutory authority for the action and for what purpose the specific condition or requirement was chosen;

3. Any member of the DRC may comment on any aspect of the argument, but only the DRC member who attached the condition or requirement may uphold the original decision, modify the requirement based on information the applicant may present, attach additional requirements or conditions based on information the applicant may present, or withdraw the appealed requirement;

4. Any decision on appeal shall be conveyed to the applicant in writing within three working days from the date of decision. Nothing herein prevents any matter from being continued for one or more subsequent DRC meetings, if appropriate; and

5. Only after the above administrative appeal process fails to resolve the issue to the acceptability of the applicant can the quasi-judicial appeal process be used. A formal appeal must be submitted to the examiner as prescribed in the UCADB. If any rule, regulation or code being enforced by any DRC member provides that an appeal may be filed directly to the examiner without first attempting to resolve the issue administratively, the applicant may file such an appeal at their discretion. The conduct of any appeal filed with the examiner is prescribed in the UCADB and will be used to hear and decide the appeal.

J. Any administrative appeal filed with the hearing examiner or city council shall be in substantially the following form:

1. A heading in the words “before the (hearing examiner or city council) of the city of Chehalis”;

2. A caption reading “appeal of...” (giving the names of all appellants participating in the appeal);

3. A statement setting forth the legal interest of each of the appellants in the proposal, if any;

4. A statement in ordinary and concise language as to what is being appealed, including reference to the CMC or WAC sections being cited as the basis for the appeal;

5. A brief statement describing wherein the city’s actions or determinations are not consistent with the regulations cited;

6. Attachment of copies of the applicable pages of any documents referenced in any appeal statement, including the CMC;

7. A brief statement describing with reasonable specificity what relief is being sought by the appellants;

8. The signatures of all parties named as appellants and their official mailing addresses; and

9. A declaration under penalty of perjury that the statements contained in the appeal document are true and correct and signed by at least one of the appellants.

K. The examiner or city council may waive informalities in the form of the appeal document, but may not waive the substantive information required by this section.

L. For any quasi-judicial administrative appeal heard by the examiner or city council, the “procedures for conduct of hearing appeals” specified in the UCADB shall be used by the city to conduct such appeal hearing (see Appendix Chapter E).

M. For any quasi-judicial administrative appeal heard by the examiner or city council, the city shall provide for a record consisting of the following:

1. Testimony of all participants under oath;

2. A taped transcript in standard cassette format; and

3. Written findings, conclusions, and a decision on appeal.

N. Any required filing fee (see Appendix Chapter A) must be attached to an appeal filing. Such filing shall not be complete unless the required fee is attached. [Ord. 810B § 6, 2006; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.160 Violations.

A. Failure of any person to comply with the procedural requirements of this title, or with any applicable provision identified herein, or with any condition or requirement of any development permit, license or approval, shall constitute a public nuisance, and shall be abated as provided in CMC 7.04.130.

B. Nothing herein shall preclude the city from initiating any other authorized action to correct any violation of this title, including, but not limited to, action authorized under the adopted uniform codes, and/or issuance of criminal citations. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.09.170 Appendices.

A. All appendices to this title are adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein. The full text of all adopted appendices shall be available for public review at the community development office. The user of this document should verify the full content and context of any referenced or applicable appendix prior to submitting any final proposal to the city.

B. Most appendices provide guidance for compliance with the provisions of this title. In the absence of a specific regulation relating to a specific circumstance contained in this title, the provisions of the appendix relating thereto shall be applicable unless specifically exempted therefrom.

C. The criteria in the appendices are expected to be updated frequently and/or regularly. Adoption of a revised appendix may be by resolution of the city council unless:

1. Another method of update or revision is specified in this title; or

2. The city attorney determines that an ordinance is necessary for a specific circumstance.

D. Additions (but not revisions or deletions) to any of the adopted appendices may be made to the appendix document as such pages (e.g., maps, charts, graphs, diagrams, etc.) become constructed without adoption of a resolution therefor; provided, that such pages only explain or clarify, and do not change, the requirements of this title.

17.15.010 Title, authority, purpose and policy.

A. This chapter shall be entitled the Chehalis environmental policy chapter, and may be referred to as the SEPA chapter.

B. The city of Chehalis, hereinafter referred to as “city,” adopts this chapter under the direction and authority of SEPA, RCW 43.21C.120 and the SEPA rules, WAC 197-11-904. This chapter contains the city’s SEPA procedures and policies and must be used in conjunction with the current SEPA rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC, as amended by the DOE.

C. The purpose of this chapter is to implement the SEPA, Chapter 43.21C RCW, and to ensure that environmental values are given appropriate consideration in the city’s decision-making process.

D. The policies and goals set forth in SEPA are supplementary to the city’s statutory authority. The policies enumerated in WAC 197-11-030 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.020 General requirements.

A. Lead Agency. The rules for determining lead agency status enumerated in WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-948 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein (WAC 197-11-050).

B. Timing of the SEPA Process. The rules for determining the timing of the SEPA process enumerated in WAC 197-11-055 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein, provided:

1. The times at which the environmental review will be initiated will be determined by the applicant on a case-by-case basis (WAC 197-11-055(2)(b));

2. Receipt by the city of a completed checklist, whether or not part of an application, shall require the city to initiate the applicable SEPA process;

3. A threshold determination or DEIS should accompany any staff recommendation for any nonexempt action which requires a quasi-judicial decision, i.e., conditional use permit application;

4. A final threshold determination or FEIS should accompany any planning commission recommendation for any nonexempt comprehensive plan amendment or revision; and

5. The responsible official will determine when a checklist is complete after consulting with the DRC. Such determination of completeness will occur at a regular DRC meeting. If a checklist is incomplete, a notice of incomplete application will be used to solicit additional specific information sufficient to allow a proper review.

C. Content of Environmental Review. The rules specifying the content of an environmental review enumerated in WAC 197-11-060 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein, provided:

1. Proposals shall be described in sufficient detail so as to provide an ability to measure any impact of the proposal. Alternatives to the described proposal should be presented in the checklist and/or application. Quantitative aspects of the proposal must be identified, e.g., building size, number of parking spaces, cubic yards of fill, flow rate of storm water system, etc. Qualitative aspects of the proposal should be identified in the checklist. Whether or not identified, such aspects will be subject to such conditions as are determined appropriate by the city;

2. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the reasonable alternatives to a proposal, or any mitigating conditions identified by the city; and

3. The responsible official is authorized to allow or require a phased review pursuant to WAC 197-11-060.

D. Limitations on Actions. The rules specifying the limitations on actions during the SEPA process enumerated in WAC 197-11-070 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein, provided:

1. Nonsignificant impacts which may occur as a result of studies or the development of site-specific information for the purpose of the SEPA process, and not the implementation of the proposal, will not require separate SEPA review. Appropriate mitigation measures shall be implemented to minimize or eliminate any such impact.

E. Information Required of Applicants. The rules for submission of information related to the SEPA process enumerated in WAC 197-11-080 through 197-11-100 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.030 Definitions.

The definitions contained in WAC 197-11-700 through 197-11-799 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.040 Additional definitions.

In addition to the definitions contained in WAC 197-11-700 through 197-11-799, the words and terms defined in Chapter 17.06 CMC shall be used in the administration and enforcement of this chapter. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.050 Designation of responsible official.

A. For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the community development director shall be the designated responsible official.

B. For those proposals for which the city is not the lead agency, but is an agency with jurisdiction, or a consulted agency, the community development director shall be the city’s designated contact person for receipt of SEPA documents or issuing the city’s response to a lead agency. [Ord. 819B § 13, 2007; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.060 Lead agency determinations.

A. All lead agency determinations shall be made by the responsible official. Any department within the city receiving an application for, or initiating, any proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall forward a copy of the complete application package to the responsible official for all SEPA determinations.

B. Any proposal transferred to the city as lead agency shall be forwarded to the responsible official. Any such transfer shall occur only if consistent with the procedures established in WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-948.

C. All departments of the city shall consider and use, as appropriate, the DNS, MDNS or final EIS issued by the lead agency, whether or not the city is the lead agency, in making decisions on the subject proposal. The city may conduct supplemental environmental review at its discretion pursuant to WAC 197-11-600.

D. Any department or official of the city may object to any determination made by any agency acting as lead agency during a comment period. If the city is lead agency, such objection must be filed with the responsible official within the 14-day comment period. Such objection must identify in writing:

1. The application number or other identifying procedure or process number;

2. The location of the proposal sufficient to identify geographically the locale and vicinity;

3. The specific nature of the objection and discussion of alternative to the original decision; and

4. Attachment of, or reference to, any published documents or studies substantiating the objection and/or supporting the alternative.

E. If the city is not the lead agency, such objections must be filed in the manner prescribed by the lead agency.

F. The responsible official is authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status and shared lead agency status or duties for any nonexempt proposal pursuant to WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-948.

G. The responsible official shall require that an application for a nonexempt proposal contain information in sufficient detail to determine which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal. In the absence of detailed information showing otherwise, the responsible official may assume that any agency listed in WAC 197-11-920 has jurisdiction, and require the applicant to submit appropriate applications to such jurisdiction. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.070 Transfer of lead agency status.

Any transfer of lead agency status to the city from any agency, or to any agency from the city, shall follow the applicable procedures identified in WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-948. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.080 Time limits.

A. Categorical Exemptions. The responsible official should determine whether or not a proposal is categorically exempt within seven calendar days of receiving a completed application for the underlying permit, license, or approval. For the purpose of determining exemptions, the DRC agenda process should be used to present applications for such determinations. Nothing herein shall preclude such an application from being presented directly to the responsible official by the applicant for expediency in determining whether or not the proposal is exempt.

B. Incomplete Application. The city should determine if additional information is required on any proposal within 28 days of receipt of any application for any aspect of the proposal. A “notice of incomplete application” form should be used to identify all required information to be submitted by the applicant. Such required information should relate to the environmental (SEPA) aspects of the proposal as well as the statutory or chapter requirements for permitting or approval.

C. Results of Incomplete Application. Subsequent to the city issuing a “notice of incomplete application” to an applicant, the city should allow 30 days for the receipt of required information. After such 30-day period, the city will render the subject application and/or checklist void. The applicant may reactivate the application at any time thereafter by submitting the required information. Such a reactivation shall constitute a new application for the purpose of establishing time limits for decisions by the city. Outdated or obsolete information must be made current by the applicant in such reactivation.

D. Threshold Determination.

1. Threshold determinations should be made within 15 days from the city’s receipt of a complete application and/or checklist. If the responsible official determines that another agency with jurisdiction should be consulted prior to making a threshold determination, the nature of such consultation should be made a matter of record at the earliest DRC meeting. The responsible official should make the threshold determination within 15 days from the receipt of the information requested from an agency, but in no case more than 30 days from the date of a completed application and/or checklist.

2. If the applicant proposes or agrees in the application that an EIS is required, the responsible official should make a threshold determination within five days of the date of a completed application and/or checklist.

E. The time limits established in this section shall not apply to any proposal initiated by the city when the city is lead agency. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.090 Additional timing considerations.

A. In general, the environmental review and/or preparation of an EIS for a private proposal should occur at the conceptual stage and not at the final construction detail phase. If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct the environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. The submission of a completed environmental checklist for any proposal prior to submission of any application therefor shall constitute a request to conduct such early environmental review.

B. If any nonexempt proposal requires a statutory review, public hearing and/or decision by any city agency other than the responsible official, a copy of the DNS, MDNS, or draft EIS shall be made a part of the staff report/recommendation, if any, and such review, hearing and/or decision shall consider the environmental determination. If any scheduling requirement of any agency action conflicts with the time limits established in CMC 17.15.080, the requirements of the agency action shall prevail.

C. If the optional DNS process is used for any proposal, the timing considerations for that process will supersede the time limits established in CMC 17.15.080. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.100 SEPA required elements and process.

A. The rules for establishing the required elements and the procedural process for SEPA determinations enumerated in WAC 197-11-300 through 197-11-390 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein, provided:

1. Certain categorical exemptions are modified as set forth in CMC 17.15.110;

2. The city will not document that a proposal is categorically exempt. Such a decision will be annotated in the computerized application file for a development permit and such information is available to the public on request;

3. A threshold decision should be made within 15 days of the city’s receipt of a completed checklist and/or completed application;

4. A request for early notice will not be valid and need not be responded to if the application or checklist is not complete;

5. The applicant shall be responsible for the preparation and content of a checklist, EIS, and application. Nothing in this chapter shall require any obligation or responsibility of the city to assist in the preparation of any application or environmental document for private proposals;

6. If a proposal requires a 14-day comment period under WAC 197-11-340, the responsible official shall, at the conclusion of the comment period, either:

a. Withdraw the DNS and issue a DS together with a scoping notice; or

b. Issue a final DNS;

7. If new information is obtained during the comment period which was not available prior to the threshold determination process, the responsible official is authorized to attach additional conditions to the final threshold determination to mitigate any identified probable impacts, whether or not significant or adverse;

8. All nonexempt proposals shall be presented for discussion at a DRC meeting. Such meeting shall be the opportunity for all affected city departments to convey conditions relating to other department operations to the responsible official. The responsible official shall consider all conditions presented at any DRC meeting in making a threshold determination;

9. The responsible official is authorized to attach any reasonable development condition to any threshold determination consistent with WAC 197-11-330. Such conditions should result from a discussion of the proposal at a DRC meeting; and

10. All DRC meetings relating to the SEPA process shall be open to the public. Whenever the SEPA process provides for a comment period, all comments received by the responsible official shall be reviewed by the DRC and made a matter of record, whether written or oral. Written comments must be directed to the responsible official; oral comments must be presented on the record at a DRC meeting. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.110 Categorical exemptions.

The categorical exemptions enumerated in WAC 197-11-800 through 197-11-890 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein, provided:

A. Categorical exemptions shall not be applicable if any portion of the proposal occurs within a jurisdictional wetland.

B. Categorical exemptions shall not be applicable if any portion of the proposal occurs within any shorelines management jurisdictional area.

C. Certain categorical exemptions shall not be applicable for conditional use proposals identified in the “100” sections (special provisions) of Division V of this title.

D. WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i) is amended to read:

The construction or location of any residential structures of nine dwelling units.

E. WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii) is amended to read:

The construction of an office, school, mercantile, service, storage, utility or similar nonresidential building with 12,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area, and with associated parking facilities designed for 40 automobiles; The construction of an assembly (group A) building with 5,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area and with associated parking facilities designed for 40 automobiles.

F. WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv) is amended to read:

The construction of a parking lot designed for 40 automobiles.

G. WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v) is amended to read:

Any landfill or excavation of 500 cubic yards throughout the total lifetime of the fill or excavation; and any fill or excavation classified as a Class I, II or III forest practice under RCW 76.09.050 or regulations thereunder.

[Ord. 750B § 3, 2003; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.120 Use of categorical exemptions.

A. The responsible official shall determine if any proposal or application is categorically exempt from the SEPA process. Such exemption determination shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal or application is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter shall apply to the proposal or application, and the city shall not require the completion of an environmental checklist as part of any SEPA process. Nothing herein shall preclude any city agency from requiring the completion of a checklist as part of any application process for the purpose of defining additional information, as long as such checklist is not related to the SEPA process.

B. In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible official shall require a completed application and identify the governmental licenses, permits and/or approvals required. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the SEPA process shall be required for the entire proposal, even if the application that triggers the determination is exempt.

C. Notwithstanding subsection (B) of this section, if a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except:

1. The city shall not authorize any nonexempt actions; any action that would have a significant adverse environmental impact; or any action that would limit the choice of reasonable alternatives;

2. The city shall withhold approval of any exempt action that includes modification of the physical environment if such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt actions were not approved;

3. The city may withhold approval of any exempt action that involves the potential for significant financial expenditures by the applicant if such expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt actions were not approved. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.130 Environmental checklist.

A. A completed environmental checklist in substantially the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, together with the required State Environmental Policy Act fee, shall be submitted as an attachment to any application for a nonexempt proposal. Absence of specified information on a checklist, and/or the required fee, will constitute an incomplete application for the purpose of application review. A checklist need not be attached to an application if:

1. The application indicates that an EIS will be prepared as part of the application process;

2. SEPA compliance has been accomplished prior to the submission of the application, and a copy of the document verifying such compliance is attached to the application; and

3. The application identifies and states that an agency other than the city is lead agency for SEPA compliance.

B. The applicant shall be responsible for providing all information required on the checklist in sufficient detail and completeness so as to allow an appropriate review and decision by the city. In the case of a private proposal, an applicant may solicit regulatory information from the city, but the city may not assist in the completion of any discretionary answers on the checklist.

C. A complete checklist shall contain all applicable questions answered in such a manner that the city will be able to quantify the proposal and measure any impacts, expressed in standard units of measure acceptable to the city, together with any plans, specifications, and/or applications that may be associated with the proposal. Any mitigation proposed in a checklist must also be measurable. The DRC shall advise the responsible official of when a checklist is complete.

D. The city may issue a “notice of incomplete application” for a SEPA checklist as well as an application. Such notice will specify the additional information required before the application and/or checklist will be considered complete. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.140 Early notice.

A. An applicant may request, in writing, early notice of whether or not a DS is likely on the application and/or checklist. Such a written request must:

1. Be an integral part of, or attachment to, an application and/or checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the city is lead agency; and

2. Precede the city’s first threshold determination on any aspect of the proposal.

B. The responsible official should respond to a request for early notice within 15 days from the date of a determination of completed application and/or checklist. Such response shall:

1. Be written on a standard form used for this purpose;

2. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely, and, if so, state the specific areas of concern, including lack of appropriate information, that cause such a consideration; and

3. State that if a DS is likely, the applicant may withdraw the application and/or checklist within 10 days from the date of the city’s response, modify or revise the proposal, application and/or checklist to mitigate the areas of concern, and resubmit the application and/or checklist.

C. The city will respond to an applicant inquiry relating to identification of environmental impacts, regulatory requirements and, to the extent practical, anticipated concerns of other agencies with jurisdiction. The responsible official will not give advice on the sufficiency of proposed mitigation measures, or adequacy of the additional information as it relates to the proposal. The applicant is responsible for the content of the application and/or checklist.

D. If an application is not withdrawn within 10 days of the city’s response to a request for early notice, the responsible official shall issue a threshold determination therefor. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.150 Threshold determination process.

The process used for making a threshold determination enumerated in WAC 197-11-330 is adopted by the city as if set forth herein, provided:

A. If the responsible official determines that a proposal can be mitigated to preclude any significant impacts, but the detailed plans for the proposal are not available at the conceptual stage, a phased review is appropriate consistent with WAC 197-11-060(5). The responsible official shall require a SEPA checklist on all aspects of a proposal, but such checklist may be submitted sequentially as detailed plans and specifications become available.

B. In establishing the mitigating conditions for such a phased review process, the responsible official shall ensure that all aspects of a proposal are identified in at least one checklist and in a reasonable sequence, and that elements of the proposal are not initiated by the applicant inconsistent with this chapter or WAC 197-11-070. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.160 Determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

The process used for issuing a DNS or MDNS enumerated in WAC 197-11-340 is adopted by the city as if set forth herein. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.170 Mitigated determination of nonsignificance (MDNS).

A. The city shall have the authority to attach mitigating conditions to any permit, license or approval pursuant to WAC 197-11-660.

B. The rules for determining mitigating conditions for any proposal enumerated in WAC 197-11-660 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein.

C. The standards set forth in adopted chapters, resolutions, rules, regulations, codes and any other adopted regulatory requirement, or in any comprehensive plan, shall be a basis for the attachment of any mitigating condition to any SEPA determination, permit, license and/or approval. Such standards shall include, but not be limited to, all appendices contained in this title.

D. Standards, guidelines, or other relevant criteria contained in studies, reports or other published documents may be a basis for attachment of any mitigating conditions if a direct relationship with the proposed action can be demonstrated. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.180 Optional DNS process (ODNS).

A. For any nonexempt action which requires a public notice and/or public hearing for any application for any aspect of the proposal, the responsible official may elect to use the optional DNS process. If such optional process is used, the process specified in WAC 197-11-355 shall be used.

B. The rules for implementing the optional DNS process enumerated in WAC 197-11-355 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein. If any requirement of WAC 197-11-355 conflicts with any requirement of this chapter, the SEPA rule will control and govern. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.190 Adoption of existing environmental document.

A. The rules for using existing environmental documents enumerated in WAC 197-11-600 through 197-11-640 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein.

B. The responsible official shall consider, whenever appropriate, existing environmental documents as a basis for a DS, DNS or MDNS. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.200 Effect of threshold determination.

The rules specifying the effect of a threshold determination enumerated in WAC 197-11-390 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.210 Environmental impact statement (EIS).

A. The rules for preparation of an EIS enumerated in WAC 197-11-400 through 197-11-460 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein.

B. For any nonexempt proposal which requires an EIS, the applicant shall be responsible for the preparation of any DEIS, SEIS, and/or FEIS.

C. For any nonexempt proposal initiated by the city which requires an EIS, the department having the implementing authority over the proposal shall be responsible for preparation of any DEIS, SEIS and/or FEIS.

D. A completed EIS shall be submitted to the responsible official for distribution and processing. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.220 Public notice.

A. Categorical Exemption. The city shall not publish a notice of categorical exemption. All such exemptions shall be annotated in the city’s permit application file for an exempt action, and such decision shall be available for public review on request.

B. Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS, MDNS, ODNS).

1. If a public notice is required by some other statute or chapter for any nonexempt action, such notice shall state that a DNS has been issued and, if a comment period is required, when comments are due.

2. If a public notice is not required for any nonexempt action, the city shall:

a. Publish a legal notice in The Chronicle one time;

b. Notify KELA/KMNT and KITI/Live 95 radio of the DNS via fax; and

c. For project actions which are site-specific, mail a notice to property owners of record within 300 feet of the subject property.

3. Such notice for a DNS shall be in substantially the form identified in WAC 197-11-970. Copies of any DNS will be available at the office of the responsible official for public review during regular business hours.

C. Determination of Significance (DS).

1. In addition to the notice requirements identified in subsection (B) of this section, a DS shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal consistent with WAC 197-11-408.

2. Such notice for a DS shall be in substantially the form identified in WAC 197-11-980.

D. Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS, SEIS, FEIS). In addition to the notice requirements identified in subsection (C) of this section, an EIS shall specify the availability of the document for public review.

E. For purposes of this section, a public notice shall contain a brief description of the nature of the proposal, location of the proposal, description of the city’s determination, and the date for commenting, if any. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.230 Public hearing.

A. If a public hearing is held regarding any aspect of any nonexempt proposal under some other statutory or chapter requirement, such a hearing shall also consider all determinations made under the requirements of SEPA.

B. A public hearing shall be conducted by the city council if any of the situations identified in WAC 197-11-535(2) occur.

C. The nature and specificity of any comments received by the city shall be consistent with WAC 197-11-550. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.240 Open record hearing.

A. For nonexempt proposals which require a public hearing before the board of zoning adjustment, planning commission, director of community development, and/or city council, such hearing shall constitute an open record hearing for the purpose of SEPA compliance. The chairperson of such hearing shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the SEPA aspects of any proposal in addition to, or in conjunction with, the statutory or chapter aspects during such a public hearing.

B. For nonexempt proposals which do not require a public hearing, an open record appeal hearing would be conducted on any properly filed appeal consistent with the requirements of RCW 36.70B.020(3). [Ord. 810B § 6, 2006; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.250 Public meeting/workshop.

Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit one or more informal workshop meetings to discuss any aspect of a proposal, including SEPA. Such workshop meetings shall not substitute for nor satisfy applicable SEPA requirements. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.260 SEPA decisions.

The rules for making SEPA decisions enumerated in WAC 197-11-650 through 197-11-660 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein. The responsible official shall consider mitigation conditions consistent with WAC 197-11-660. Any conditions shall be based on adopted standards and/or regulations, and be made a matter of record at a DRC meeting. Denial or conditioning of a proposal based only on public displeasure or unsubstantiated demands shall not be allowed. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.15.270 Administrative appeals.

A. The rules for the conduct of appeals enumerated in WAC 197-11-680 are adopted by the city as if set forth herein.

B. There shall be no method of appeal of any SEPA determination to the legislative body (city council).

C. Appeals of a final threshold determination and/or the adequacy of a final EIS may be submitted as provided in this section. Such appeals may be initiated prior to the city’s decision on an underlying permit, license or approval. Appeals of intermediate steps under SEPA will not be allowed.

D. The required appeal fee must be submitted with any appeal document. No appeal will be accepted for filing if the filing fee is not included. It is the responsibility of the appellant to complete any appeal filing within the required time limits.

E. Only one open record or closed record appeal will be allowed on any proposal. If more than one appeal is filed, all appeals will be consolidated into one procedure. All appeal documents must be submitted in substantially the form identified in CMC 17.15.280.

F. An open record appeal hearing will be conducted on any properly filed appeal if no open record predecision hearing has been conducted on any aspect of the proposal. A closed record appeal will be conducted on any properly filed appeal if any open record predecision hearing has been conducted on any aspect of the proposal.

G. All administrative appeals must be filed with the hearing examiner within 14 days of the date that the decision being appealed is made a matter of record. Such decisions will be made a matter of record at a scheduled DRC meeting. In the case of a decision made at, or subsequent to, a scheduled public hearing, such decisions will become a matter of record at such time as they are made at an open public meeting. If the SEPA process is conducted on a nonexempt proposal prior to any permit applications being submitted, any SEPA appeal must be filed with the hearing examiner. If the SEPA process is conducted on a nonexempt proposal concurrent with permit application review, any appeal of the permit decision must be filed together with the SEPA appeal. The city will not entertain separate appeals for permit decisions and SEPA decisions if both such decisions have been made on any proposal.

H. The procedural actions of the city shall carry substantial weight in any appeal proceeding. An appellant shall be required to identify a specific procedure or process required by this chapter, and demonstrate wherein the city failed to follow such procedure or process.

17.21.010 Purpose and authority. 

 A. These sections establish regulations pertaining to the development of critical areas, as required under the Growth Management Act of 1990 (Chapter 36.70A RCW). State guidelines for classification and protective methods for critical areas are addressed in Chapter 365-190 WAC. “Critical areas” are wetland areas, aquifer recharge areas, frequently flooded areas, geologically hazardous areas, and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. 

 B. The purpose of these local regulations is to protect the environmentally sensitive resources of the city of Chehalis by establishing minimum standards for development of properties which contain or adjoin environmentally sensitive features and thus protect the public health, safety and welfare in regard to critical areas. The city is classifying all required categories of critical areas throughout the city and implementing development regulations to address these areas through these chapters. These standards serve to preclude land uses and developments which are incompatible with critical areas by: 

1. Protecting the public from personal injury, loss of life or property damage due to flooding, erosion, landslides, seismic events, or soil subsidence; 

2. Protecting against publicly financed expenditures to address improper use or improper management of critical areas; 

3. Preventing degradation of the natural environment; 

4. Protecting unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment; 

5. Including the best available science in developing policies and development regulations to protect the functions and values of critical areas; 

6. Giving special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fisheries;

7. Alerting property owners, potential buyers or lessees, appraisers, assessors, and others to the existence of and the development limitations of critical areas; 

8. Providing city officials with sufficient information to adequately protect critical areas when approving, conditioning or denying public or private development proposals; 

9. Meeting the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and maintaining Chehalis as an eligible community for federal flood insurance benefits. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.020 Applicability.

This chapter establishes designations and regulations for the protection of all properties which are critical areas. Properties listed, identified, designated, classified or rated as critical areas are those so designated on the resource maps referenced in this chapter, or by separate studies which indicate that all or portions of a particular area or specific site are environmentally sensitive or critical areas. A site-specific analysis which indicates that any element regulated by this chapter is present will result in a property being classified as an environmentally sensitive critical area. Land uses or developments proposed on or adjacent to sites which are critical areas shall comply with the provisions of this chapter. “Critical areas” are wetlands, frequently flooded areas, critical aquifer recharge areas, geologically hazardous areas, and critical fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.030 Definitions. 

Definitions of terms used in this chapter are: 

“Accessory structure” means a structure that is incidental and subordinate to a primary use. Barns, garages, storage sheds, and similar structures are examples. 

“Activity” means human activity associated with the use of land or resources. 

“Adaptive management” means using scientific methods to evaluate how well regulatory and nonregulatory actions protect the critical area. An adaptive management program is a formal and deliberate scientific approach to taking action and obtaining information in the face of uncertainty. Management policy may be adapted based on a periodic review of new information. 

“Agricultural activities” means those activities directly pertaining to the production of crops or livestock including, but not limited to, cultivation, harvest, grazing, animal waste storage and disposal, fertilization, the operation and maintenance of farm and stock ponds or drainage ditches, irrigation systems, canals, and normal maintenance, repair, or operation of existing serviceable structures, facilities, or improved areas. Activities that bring an area into agricultural use are not agricultural activities. 

“Agricultural land” is land primarily devoted to the commercial production of horticultural, viticultural, floricultural, dairy, apiary, or animal products, or of berries, grain, hay, straw, turf, seed, Christmas trees not subject to the excise tax imposed by RCW 84.33.100 through 84.33.140, or livestock, and/or lands that have been designated as capable of producing food and fiber, which have not been developed for urban density housing, business, or other uses incompatible with agricultural activity. 

“Alluvial fan” means a fan-shaped deposit of sediment and organic debris formed where a stream flows or has flowed out of a mountainous upland onto a level plain or valley floor because of a sudden change in sediment transport capacity (e.g., significant change in slope or confinement). 

“Alluvium” is a general term for clay, silt, sand, gravel, or similar other unconsolidated detrital materials, deposited during comparatively recent geologic time by a stream or other body of running water, as a sorted or semi-sorted sediment in the bed of the stream or on its floodplain or delta. 

“Alteration” means any human-induced change in an existing condition of a critical area or its buffer. Alterations include but are not limited to grading, filling, channelizing, dredging, clearing (vegetation), draining, construction, compaction, excavation, or any other activity that changes the character of the critical area. 

“Anadromous fish” means fish species that spend most of their life cycle in salt water, but return to freshwater to reproduce. 

“Aquifer” means a geologic formation, group of formations, or part of a formation capable of yielding a significant amount of groundwater to wells or springs (Chapter 173-160 WAC). 

“Aquifer susceptibility” means the ease with which contaminants can move from the land surface to the aquifer based solely on the types of surface and subsurface materials in the area. Susceptibility usually defines the rate at which a contaminant will reach an aquifer unimpeded by chemical interactions with the vadose zone media. 

“Aquifer vulnerability” is the combined effect of susceptibility to contamination and the presence of potential contaminants. 

“Base flood” is a flood event having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, also referred to as the 100-year flood. Designations of base flood areas on flood insurance map(s) always include the letters A (zone subject to flooding during a 100-year flood, but less so than V zones) or V (zone subject to the highest flows, wave action, and erosion during a 100-year flood). 

“Bedrock” is a general term for rock, typically hard, consolidated geologic material that underlies soil or other unconsolidated, superficial material or is exposed at the surface. 

“Best available science” means information from research, inventory, monitoring, surveys, modeling, synthesis, expert opinion, and assessment that is used to designate, protect, or restore critical areas. As defined by WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925, best available science is derived from a process that includes peer-reviewed literature, standard methods, logical conclusions and reasonable inferences, quantitative analysis, and documented references to produce reliable information. 

“Best management practices” means conservation practices or systems of practices and management measures that reflect the current scientific and technical consensus on the best or most effective means of addressing adverse effects upon a resource. 

“Buffer” means the area adjacent to the outer boundaries of a critical area, such as wetlands; habitat conservation (streams, marine shorelines habitat areas); and/or landslide hazard areas, that provides an area for related ecological functions to take place and/or separates and protects critical areas from adverse impacts associated with adjacent land uses. 

“Channel migration zone” means the area along a river or stream within which the channel can reasonably be expected to migrate over time as a result of normally occurring processes. It encompasses that area of current and historic lateral stream channel movement that is subject to erosion, bank destabilization, rapid stream incision, and/or channel shifting, as well as adjacent areas that are susceptible to channel erosion. 

“City” means the city of Chehalis, Washington. 

“Clearing” means the removal of vegetation or plant cover by manual, chemical, or mechanical means. Clearing includes, but is not limited to, actions such as cutting, felling, thinning, flooding, killing, poisoning, girdling, uprooting, or burning. 

“Compensatory mitigation” means a mitigation project for the purpose of replacing, at an equivalent or greater level, unavoidable critical area and buffer impacts that remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization measures have been implemented. Compensatory mitigation includes, but is not limited to, wetland creation, restoration, enhancement, and preservation; stream restoration and relocation, rehabilitation; and buffer enhancement. 

“Conservation” means the prudent management of rivers, streams, wetlands, wildlife and other environmental resources in order to preserve and protect them. This includes the careful utilization of natural resources in order to prevent depletion or harm to the environment. 

“Conservation easement” means a legal agreement that the property owner enters into to restrict uses of the land for purposes of natural resources conservation. The easement is recorded on a property deed, runs with the land, and is legally binding on all present and future owners of the property. 

“Contaminant” means any chemical, physical, biological, or radiological substance that does not occur naturally in groundwater, air, or soil or that occurs at concentrations greater than those in the natural levels (see also Chapter 173-200 WAC). 

“Critical aquifer recharge area” means areas designated by WAC 365-190-080(2) that are determined to have a critical recharging effect on aquifers (i.e., maintain the quality and quantity of water) used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). 

“Critical area study or report” means a report prepared by a qualified professional or qualified consultant based on best available science, and the specific methods and standards for technical study required for each applicable critical area. Geotechnical reports and hydrogeological reports are critical area reports specific to geologically hazardous areas and critical aquifer recharge areas, respectively. 

“Critical area tract” means land held in an open undeveloped condition with preservation of native vegetation and other natural features in perpetuity for the protection of critical areas.

Such areas are identified herein with reference to lists, categories, and definitions promulgated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife as identified in WAC 232-12-011 or 232-12-014; in the Priority Habitat and Species (PHS) program of the Department of Fish and Wildlife; or by rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, or other agency with jurisdiction for such designations. 

“Debris flow” means a moving mass of rock fragments, soil, and mud; more than half of the particles being larger than sand size; a general term that describes a mass movement of sediment mixed with water and air that flows readily on low slopes. 

“Debris torrent” means a violent and rushing mass of water, logs, boulders and other debris. 

“Deepwater habitats” means permanently flooded lands lying below the deepwater boundary of wetlands. Deepwater habitats include environments where surface water is permanent and often deep, so that water, rather than air, is the principal medium in which the dominant organisms live. The boundary between wetland and deepwater habitat in the riverine and lacustrine systems lies at a depth of two meters (6.6 feet) below low water; however, if emergent vegetation, shrubs, or trees grow beyond this depth at any time, their deepwater edge is the boundary. 

“Development” means any activity that results in a change of use or modification of land or its resource. These activities include, but are not limited to: clearing of vegetation; filling, grading and other topographic modification; building construction or modification; construction of roads, trails, utilities and other facilities. 

“Director” means the director of the city of Chehalis department of community and economic development. Functions of the director as defined by this chapter may be assigned to other city of Chehalis staff persons at the discretion of the director. 

“Drainage ditch” means an artificially created watercourse constructed to drain surface or groundwater. Ditches are graded (manmade) channels installed to collect and convey runoff from fields and roadways. Ditches may include irrigation ditches, waste ways, drains, outfalls, operational spillways, channels, storm water runoff facilities or other wholly artificial watercourses, except those that directly result from the modification to a natural watercourse. Ditched channels that support fish are considered to be streams. 

“Emergency” refers to an unanticipated and imminent threat to public health, safety or the environment. Emergency construction does not include development of new permanent protective structures where none previously existed. As a general matter, flooding or other seasonal events that can be anticipated and may occur but that are not imminent are not an emergency. 

“Emergent wetland” means a wetland with at least 30 percent of the surface area covered by erect, rooted, herbaceous vegetation as the uppermost vegetative strata. 

“Enhancement” means actions performed within an existing degraded critical area and/or buffer to intentionally increase or augment one or more functions or values of the existing critical area or buffer. Enhancement actions include, but are not limited to, increasing plant diversity and cover, increasing wildlife habitat and structural complexity (snags, woody debris), installing environmentally compatible erosion controls, or removing nonindigenous plant or animal species. 

“Erosion” means a process whereby wind, rain, water and other natural agents mobilize, and transport, and deposit soil particles. 

“Erosion hazard areas” means lands or areas underlain by soils identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) as having severe or very severe erosion hazards and areas subject to impacts from lateral erosion related to moving water such as river channel migration and shoreline retreat. 

“Essential public facility” means those facilities that are typically difficult to site, such as airports, state education facilities, and state or regional transportation facilities, state and local correctional facilities, solid waste handling facilities, and inpatient facilities including substance abuse facilities, mental health facilities, and group homes. 

“Feasible alternative” means a course of action that can include uses, design, construction techniques, and other features on a site or alternative sites that are reasonably capable of being carried out after taking into consideration existing technology and logistics and that has less impact to critical areas. Cost is one factor in determining whether an action is capable of being carried out. 

“Fill material” means any solid or semi-solid material, including rock, sand, soil, clay, plastics, construction debris, wood chips, overburden from mining or other excavation activities, and materials used to create any structure or infrastructure, that when placed, changes the grade or elevation of the receiving site. 

“Filling” means the act of transporting or placing by any manual or mechanical means fill material from, to, or on any soil surface, including temporary stockpiling of fill material. 

“Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas” are areas important for maintaining species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that isolated populations are not created. 

“Fish habitat” means a complex of physical, chemical, and biological conditions that provide the life supporting and reproductive needs of a species or life stage of fish. Although the habitat requirements of a species depend on its age and activity, the basic components of fish habitat in rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, estuaries, marine waters, and nearshore areas include, but are not limited to, the following: 

1. Clean water and appropriate temperatures for spawning, rearing, and holding; 

2. Adequate water depth and velocity for migrating, spawning, rearing, and holding, including off-channel habitat; 

3. Abundance of bank and in-stream structures to provide hiding and resting areas and stabilize stream banks and beds; 

4. Appropriate substrates for spawning and embryonic development. For stream and lake dwelling fishes, substrates range from sands and gravel to rooted vegetation or submerged rocks and logs. Generally, substrates must be relatively stable and free of silts or fine sand; 

5. Presence of riparian vegetation as defined in this article. Riparian vegetation creates a transition zone, which provides shade, and food sources of aquatic and terrestrial insects for fish; 

6. Unimpeded passage (i.e., due to suitable gradient and lack of barriers) for upstream and downstream migrating juveniles and adults. 

“Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters and/or the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 

“Floodplain” means the total land area adjoining a river, stream, watercourse, or lake subject to inundation by the base flood. 

“Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land area that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the surface water elevation more than one foot. 

“Forested wetland” means a wetland with at least 30 percent of the surface area covered by woody vegetation greater than 20 feet in height, excluding monotypic stands of red alder or cottonwood that average eight inches in diameter at breast height or less. 

“Frequently flooded areas” means lands in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year and those lands that provide important flood storage, conveyance and attenuation functions, as determined by the county in accordance with WAC 365-190-080(3). Classifications of frequently flooded areas include, at a minimum, the 100-year floodplain designations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Flood Insurance Program. 

“Function and value” means the beneficial roles served by critical areas and the values people derive from these roles including, but not limited to, water quality protection and enhancement, fish and wildlife habitat, food chain support, flood storage, conveyance and attenuation, groundwater recharge and discharge, erosion control, wave attenuation, protection from hazards, providing historical and archaeological resources, noise and visual screening, open space, and recreation. These beneficial roles are not listed in order of priority. 

“Function assessment” or “functions and values assessment” means a set of procedures, applied by a qualified professional, to identify the ecological functions being performed in a wetland or other critical area, usually by determining the presence of certain characteristics, and determining how well the critical area is performing those functions. Function assessments can be qualitative or quantitative and may consider social values potentially provided by the wetland or other critical area. Function assessment methods must be consistent with best available science. 

“Functions” means the processes or attributes provided by areas of the landscape (e.g., wetlands, rivers, streams, and riparian areas) including, but not limited to, habitat diversity and food chain support for fish and wildlife, groundwater recharge and discharge, high primary productivity, low flow stream water contribution, sediment stabilization and erosion control, storm and flood water attenuation and flood peak desynchronization, and water quality enhancement through biofiltration and retention of sediments, nutrients, and toxicants. These beneficial roles are not listed in order of priority. 

“Game fish” means those species of fish that are classified by the Washington Department of Wildlife as game fish (WAC 232-12-019). 

“Geologically hazardous areas” means areas that, because of their susceptibility to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events, pose unacceptable risks to public health and safety and may not be suited to commercial, residential, or industrial development. 

“Gradient” means a degree of inclination, or a rate of ascent or descent, of an inclined part of the earth’s surface with respect to the horizontal; the steepness of a slope. It is expressed as a ratio (vertical to horizontal), a fraction (such as meters/kilometers or feet/miles), a percentage (of horizontal distance), or an angle (in degrees). 

“Grading” means any excavating or filling of the earth’s surface or combination thereof. 

“Groundwater” means all water that exists beneath the land surface or beneath the bed of any stream, lake, reservoir, or other body of surface water within the boundaries of the state, whatever may be the geological formation or structure in which such water stands or flows, percolates or otherwise moves (Chapter 90.44 RCW). 

“Groundwater management area” means a specific geographic area or subarea designated pursuant to Chapter 173-100 WAC for which a groundwater management program is required.

“Groundwater management program” means a comprehensive program designed to protect groundwater quality, to assure groundwater quantity, and to provide for efficient management of water resources while recognizing existing groundwater rights and meeting future needs consistent with local and state objectives, policies and authorities within a designated groundwater management area or subarea and developed pursuant to Chapter 173-100 WAC. 

“Growing season” means the portion of the year when soil temperatures are above biologic zero (41 degrees Fahrenheit). 

“Growth Management Act” means Chapters 36.70A and 36.70B RCW, as amended.

17.21.080 Preliminary consultation. 

During the application completeness review period for any subdivision of property, short plat, boundary line adjustment, site plan review, building permit, business license, or any activity requiring city review and/or approval, the property which is the subject of such permit or approval process shall be reviewed by the city for the purpose of identifying the possible presence of a critical area on or adjacent to such property. Where appropriate the city will conduct a preliminary site inspection to confirm the presence of a potential critical area. Within 15 city business days of the receipt of any such application, the city shall notify the applicant in writing of the possible presence of a critical area and provide consultation, if requested, regarding additional data requirements or methods of compliance with this chapter, including submittal of a critical area study. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.081 Permit processing. 

A. The approval or denial of an activity or modification within a critical area shall be an administrative action of the director for actions requiring only a building permit or other permit action requiring only ministerial action as defined by relevant city codes. The review process will be integrated with the review of the underlying permit. Public notice is required only if required by the underlying permit. 

B. If a project requires another permitting action by the city which requires a public hearing, consideration of critical areas will be integrated with the underlying permitting process. 

C. The director shall perform a critical area review for any application for a development proposal on a site that includes one or more critical areas or would affect critical areas on adjacent lands, unless otherwise provided in this chapter. As part of all development applications, the director shall verify the information submitted by the applicant to: 

1. Confirm the nature and type of the critical areas and associated buffers; 

2. Evaluate the need for critical area studies or the adequacy of any such studies submitted with the application; 

3. Determine whether the development proposal is consistent with these critical area regulations; 

4. Determine whether proposed alterations to critical areas are necessary; 

5. Determine if the mitigation and monitoring plans and bonding measures proposed by the applicant are sufficient to protect the public health, safety and welfare consistent with the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of this overlay district. 

D. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not necessarily constitute compliance with other regulations and permit requirements. Permit applicants are responsible for complying with all federal, state, county, and local regulations that may pertain to a proposed development; provided, that conditions imposed by the city shall be coordinated with the conditions imposed by other agencies to the extent feasible. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.082 Critical area studies. 

An applicant for a development proposal that includes, or is adjacent to, or could adversely impact critical areas or buffers shall submit such studies prepared by a qualified professional as are required by the director to adequately evaluate the proposal and all probable impacts. The study shall be prepared by a qualified professional as defined in CMC 17.21.030 and paid for by the applicant. 

A. Waivers. The director may waive the requirement for a critical area study if there is a substantial showing that: 

1. The boundaries of the critical area and associated buffers can be reliably determined without a technical study; 

2. There will be no alteration of the critical area or required buffer; 

3. The development proposal will not impact critical areas in a manner contrary to the goals, purposes, objectives and requirements of this chapter; 

4. The criteria and standards required by this chapter are met. 

B. The contents of the critical area study are specified in the following sections of this chapter. The director may require such supplements or amendments to the study as necessary to develop a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the site conditions, potential impacts, and required mitigation. 

C. Independent Review. Based on a review of the information contained in the critical area study and the conditions of the development proposal site, the director may require independent review of any such study. This independent review shall be performed by qualified professional selected by the city and paid for by the applicant. The purpose of such independent review is to assist the city in evaluating the effects on critical areas that may be caused by a development proposal and to facilitate the decision making process. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.083 Reasonable use. 

A. If the application of the regulations in this chapter would deny all reasonable use of the property, development may be allowed consistent with the general purposes of these regulations and the public interest. 

B. Reasonable Use Standards. To qualify as a reasonable use, the decision maker must find that proposal is consistent with all of the following criteria: 

1. There is no portion of the site under contiguous ownership not subject to critical area regulations where the provisions of this chapter allow reasonable economic use, including agricultural use, forestry use or continuation of legal nonconforming uses; 

2. There is no feasible on-site alternative to the proposed use or activities that will provide reasonable economic use, including location on any contiguous parcel that has been under the ownership or control of the applicant since the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter; other allowed uses; continuation of legal nonconforming uses; reduction in size, change in timing of activities, revision of road and lot layout, and/or related site planning considerations, that would allow a reasonable economic use with less adverse impacts to critical areas and associated buffers; 

3. The inability to derive reasonable economic use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant in segregating or dividing the property and/or creating the condition of lack of use after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter;

4. All reasonable methods, to avoid or reduce adverse effects on critical area functions and values have been employed, including locating activities as far as possible from critical areas and design that will result in the minimum alteration of critical areas and associated buffers, existing topography, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, hydrological conditions, and geologic conditions. Where both critical areas and buffer areas are located on a parcel, buffer areas shall be disturbed in preference to the critical area;

5. The project includes compensatory mitigation for unavoidable impacts to critical area and buffers in accordance with the mitigation requirements of this chapter; 

6. The proposed activities will not result in adverse effects on endangered or threatened species as listed by the federal government or the state of Washington, or be inconsistent with an adopted recovery plan;

7. The proposed activities will not result in damage to nearby public or private property and no threat to the health or safety of people on or off the site; 

8. The proposed activities will not lead to degradation of groundwater or surface water quality and will comply with all state, local and federal laws, including those related sediment control, pollution control, floodplain restrictions, and on-site wastewater disposal. 

C. Nonconforming single-family residential lots meeting the criteria of CMC 17.21.088(F) shall not be required to meet criteria in subsections (B)(1), (2) and (5) of this section. 

D. An application for a critical areas reasonable use exception shall follow the procedures for a special use permit review pursuant to CMC 17.09.110, except that approvals in accordance with subsection (C) of this section shall be approved by the director in accordance with the approval procedure for the underlying permit. 

E. An application for variance to provisions of this code may be considered in accordance with variance provisions in CMC 17.09.120. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.084 Density credits. 

A. Critical areas and their buffers may be used in the calculation of allowed density to the extent provided by the zoning code and shoreline master program. 

B. Full density as allowed by underlying zoning and minimum residential density goals may not be attained on specific parcels where critical areas impose inherent limitations on development intensity. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.085 Notice on title. 

A. The owner of any property containing critical areas on which a development proposal is approved shall file with the records division of Lewis County a notice in a format approved by the director and provide a copy of the filed notice to the city of Chehalis planning department, unless notice is provided on a plat as provided in subsection (B) of this section. The notice shall: 

1. State the presence of the critical area and/or buffer area on the property, and identify that there are limitations and restrictions on uses and actions in or affecting the critical area and/or buffer imposed by this code and by the provisions of the critical areas code and specific conditions of approval. The notice shall indicate that the restrictions run with the land and may be altered only in conjunction with amendment of this chapter or amendment of specific conditions of approval as provided by this chapter. 

2. Provide that management of the critical area is required to include, but is not limited to, maintenance or replacement of vegetation to assure the long-term viability of a community of native vegetation, control of invasive plant control, and fulfillment of other conditions of approval. 

3. Provide for the right of the public, and specifically the city of Chehalis, to enforce the terms of the restrictions through civil infraction or other legal address. 

4. If a site plan has been approved indicating the extent of the critical area and buffer and permit conditions, a copy of the site plan together with relevant survey information and permit conditions shall be included in the notice filed. 

B. Restrictions on use and development of critical areas buffers and setback areas on plats and short plats shall include the information in subsection (A) of this section, shall designate the party responsible for maintenance of the critical area, if other than the property owner, and shall place critical areas in tracts or easements as provided below: 

1. Designation of separate tracts for critical areas and buffers shall be the preferred method of designation and protection of critical areas in plats to provide for integrated management of the critical area and buffer separately from lots. The tract may be: 

a. Held in an undivided interest by each owner of a building lot within the development, the ownership of which shall pass with the ownership of the lot. Responsibility for meeting all requirements of preservation and management shall be designated to an incorporated homeowner’s association or other legal entity that assures the ownership and protection of the critical area. 

b. Dedicated to the city of Chehalis or other governmental entity qualified to own and manage open space. 

c. Conveyed to a nonprofit land trust, provided the land may not be thereafter transferred to a private party; and provided, that if the land trust is dissolved or otherwise fails to perform its functions, ownership and responsibility for management shall devolve to an undivided interest by each owner of a building lot within the development, as provided in subsection (B)(1)(a) of this section.

2. The director may allow a critical area and buffer to be placed within a protective easement on a parcel with the responsibility for meeting all requirements of preservation and management placed on the owner of the parcel over which the easement is placed. This means of designation shall be used in cases where the size and the ecological functions of the critical area do not require coordinated management or where formation of an incorporated homeowner’s association or other legal entity for management is found to be impractical because of the limited number of lots, or where ownership and management by the city, a qualified special district or a land trust is found to be impractical. This alternative generally will be limited to critical areas and buffers of less than 20,000 square feet and developments of fewer than 10 parcels, or commercial or multifamily development. 

C. This notice on title shall not be required for a development proposal by a public agency or public or private utility within a right-of-way or easement for which they do not have fee-simple title. 

D. The applicant shall submit proof that the notice, dedication or easement has been filed for public record before the city shall approve any final plat or final site plan for such site. The notice shall run with the land and failure to provide such notice to any purchaser prior to transferring any interest in the property shall be a violation of this section. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.086 Building setbacks. 

A. Buildings and other structures shall be set back a sufficient distance to assure that disturbance to sensitive area vegetation and soils is avoided during construction, maintenance and use. 

B. Buildings and other structures shall be set back a distance of 10 feet from the edges of all critical area buffers or from the edges of all critical areas if no buffers are required; provided, that the director may modify the building setback based on specific development plans that document that construction techniques, maintenance needs and use will not disturb critical areas or buffer. 

C. If slopes adjacent to the buffer for wetlands or water bodies exceed 15 percent, including slopes created by grading, a swale sufficient to intercept surface water movement shall be installed outside the edge of the buffer. 

D. The following facilities and uses are allowed in the building setback: 

1. Landscaping, including rockeries not over 42 inches high, provided construction does not alter the buffer or critical area; 

2. Uncovered decks, platforms, porches and similar projections not over 42 inches high; 

3. Building eaves, cornices, chimneys and similar projections no greater than two feet into the building setback;

4. Impervious surfaces such as driveways, parking lots, roads, and patios; provided, that such surfaces conform to applicable water quality standards and that construction equipment does not enter the buffer or critical area; 

5. Clearing and grading consisting of not over 42 inches of cut or fill. [Ord. 849B § 2, 2009.]


17.21.087 Mitigation. 

A. Mitigation measures shall be implemented to protect critical areas and buffers from alterations occurring on all or portions of a site being developed. The mitigation measures required below shall be implemented in conjunction with other applicable mitigation requirements outlined in the subsequent sections of this chapter. 

B. For purposes of this chapter, “mitigation” means the use of the following actions that are listed in descending order of preference: 

1. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 

2. Minimizing impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impact; 

3. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating or restoring the critical areas; 

4. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by prevention and maintenance operations; 

5. Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute areas and environments and replacing the ecological processes and functions of the resource; 

6. Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures. 

C. Location. Compensatory mitigation shall be provided on site or off site in the location that will provide the greatest ecological benefit and have the greatest likelihood of success. Off-site mitigation is preferred close as possible to the impact area and within the same watershed sub-basin as the permitted alteration. Off-site mitigation sites preference shall be given to sites and restoration activities identified in an adopted shoreline restoration plan pursuant to Chapter 173-26 WAC, a watershed planning document prepared and adopted pursuant to Chapter 90.82 WAC, a watershed restoration project pursuant to RCW 89.08.460, a salmonid recovery plan, the Salmon Recovery Board Habitat Project List, or identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife as essential for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement pursuant to RCW 77.55.290. 

D. Mitigation Plan. A mitigation plan shall be required for the design, implementation, maintenance and monitoring of mitigation. A plan shall provide the following, in addition to criteria for the specific critical areas provided below for individual critical areas: 

1. A description and evaluation of any critical areas that could be altered by the proposed development, including evaluation of ecological processes and functions based on best available science and detailed field assessment of the affected resources; 

2. A description and scaled drawings of the proposed mitigation activities including, but not limited to, clearing, grading/excavation, drainage alterations, planting, invasive plant management, installation of habitat structures, irrigation, and other site treatments; 

3. A description of the ecological functions and values that the proposed alteration may affect and of the specific ecological functions and values the proposed mitigation area(s) shall provide; 

4. A description of required or recommended mitigation ratios and an assessment of factors that may affect the success of the mitigation program; 

5. Specific measurable performance standards that the proposed mitigation action(s) shall achieve together with a description of how the mitigation action(s) will be evaluated and monitored to determine if the performance standards are being met; 

6. A description of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates that project performance standards are not being met; 

7. Cost estimates for the installation of the mitigation program, monitoring, and maintenance as well as for corrective action if mitigation performance standards are not met. 

E. A performance assurance shall be provided to guarantee installation, monitoring and performance of mitigation actions.

1. Performance Surety. The applicant shall post a cash performance bond, letter of credit, or other security acceptable to the city of Chehalis in the amount of 125 percent of the estimated cost of the uncompleted actions or the estimated cost of restoring the functions and values of the critical area that are at risk, whichever is greater. The surety shall be based on an itemized cost estimate of the mitigation activity including clearing and grading, plant materials, plant installation, irrigation, weed management, monitoring, and other costs. The conditions of the surety shall be consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the conditions to be fulfilled. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the city of Chehalis may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. The city of Chehalis shall release the bond upon determining that: 

a. All activities, including any required compensatory mitigation, have been completed in compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit and the requirements of this chapter; 

b. Upon the posting by the applicant of a maintenance surety. 

2. Maintenance Surety. The city of Chehalis shall require the holder of a development permit issued pursuant to this chapter to post a cash performance bond, letter of credit, or other security acceptable to the city of Chehalis in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to guarantee that structures, improvements and mitigation required by the permit or by this chapter perform satisfactorily, generally for a period of five years after they have been completed. The city of Chehalis shall release the maintenance bond upon determining that performance standards established for evaluating the effectiveness and success of the structures, improvements and/or compensatory mitigation have been satisfactorily met for the required period. For compensation projects, the performance standards shall be those contained in the mitigation plan developed and approved during the permit review process. The maintenance bond applicable to a compensation project shall not be released until the city of Chehalis determines that performance standards established for evaluating the effect and success of the project have been met. The director may return up to 50 percent of the surety following the first year of monitoring; provided, that the year one performance standards are met and the risk of subsequent failure is considered low. 

3. Depletion, failure, or collection of surety funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation, maintenance, or monitoring. 

4. Public development proposals may be relieved from having to comply with the surety requirements of this section if public funds have been committed through a budget process with final approval for mitigation, maintenance, or monitoring. 

F. Mitigation Banking. The city may approve mitigation banking as a form of compensatory mitigation for wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat conservation area impacts when the provisions of this chapter require mitigation and when it is clearly demonstrated that the use of a mitigation bank will provide equivalent or greater replacement of critical area functions and values when compared to conventional on-site mitigation; provided, that all of the following criteria are met: 

1. Mitigation banks shall only be used when they provide significant ecological benefits including long-term conservation of critical areas, important species, habitats and/or habitat linkages, and when they are consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan and create a viable alternative to the piecemeal mitigation for individual project impacts to achieve ecosystem-based conservation goals. 

2. The mitigation bank shall be established in accordance with the Washington State Draft Mitigation Banking Rule, Chapter 173-700 WAC or as revised, and Chapter 90.84 RCW and the federal mitigation banking guidelines as outlined in the Federal Register Volume 60 No. 228, November 28, 1995. These guidelines establish the procedural and technical criteria that banks must meet to obtain state and federal certification. 

3. Preference shall be given to mitigation banks that implement restoration actions that have been identified in an adopted shoreline restoration plan, watershed planning document prepared and adopted pursuant to Chapter 90.82 RCW, a salmonid recovery plan or project that has been identified on the Salmon Recovery Board Habitat Project List or by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife as essential for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement.

17.22.010 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of Chehalis are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by climatic conditions and the cumulative effect of natural and manmade obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and may damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.020 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood-blight areas;

G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.030 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.035 Zero-rise policy.

A. A “zero-rise policy” means any project in a floodplain must be reviewed to determine to not increase flood heights. 

B. Any fill material over 500 cubic yards cumulatively placed within a floodplain shall require compensatory excavation necessary to achieve zero net rise.

C. Any fill greater than 500 cubic yards as measured cumulatively within the 100-year floodplain shall require a P.E. stamped engineering report identifying the findings on the impact of the BFE in terms of impacting the height of the BFE based on the proposed fill project. The engineer will evaluate the impact referencing the latest HEC-RAS hydraulic modeling or other available modeling consistent with current hydraulic modeling. 

D. If an engineering report shows a rise in the BFE, the applicant shall provide compensatory excavation. The compensatory site must remain as a compensatory site in perpetuity. However, if the fill site is behind the airport levee, the compensatory site must function as such, or until the levee is raised utilizing NGVD29 with a BFE of 182 feet. It shall be the applicant’s responsibility to obtain a compensatory fill site and secure such site prior to commencing fill.

E. The compensatory fill site shall be recorded as such with the Lewis County auditor.

F. The requirement of compensatory fill is waived if an engineering report is provided from a professional engineer stating there will be no rise in the BFE due to the proposed fill. The report shall be stamped by the P.E.

G. If the engineering report shows a rise in the base flood elevation (BFE) due to the proposed fill, in lieu of compensatory excavation, the applicant may contribute funds for flood storage mitigation and aquatic species enhancement projects within the Chehalis River floodplain. Said fee will be calculated per cubic yard of material, utilizing prevailing wage rates. Said fee will need to be periodically updated to meet future prevailing wage rates or other costs that may fluctuate. Said fees shall be deposited into the city’s compensatory excavation mitigation fund, which will be utilized solely for capital projects that provide flood storage and habitat enhancement that are on the Chehalis River and its associated floodplain within the city of Chehalis limits. Said fee shall be added to the city’s fee schedule. [Ord. 982B Â§ 1, 2017; Ord. 958B § 2, 2016.]


17.22.040 Flood hazard zone created.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Chehalis,” dated July 17, 2006, (Appendix Chapter W), with associated flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs), is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The FIRMs are on file at the Community Development Department, 1321 S. Market Boulevard. The city of Chehalis shall also be empowered to create special flood hazard zones. Best available information shall also be used to determine the flood hazard zone based on elevation data, topographic information and flood-of-record data. [Ord. 858B § 10, 2010; Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.050 Compliance.

This chapter shall apply to all areas subject to a base flood and/or designated as an area of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. All development shall hereafter proceed in compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.060 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions which may be enforced by private action among the affected parties. This chapter establishes the standards for public action. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.070 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.080 Criteria for land management and use.

The standards and definitions contained in this title shall be the minimum standards administered and enforced for flood damage reduction within the city and its UGA. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.090 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on unpredictable occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not warrant or imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. The city and/or any of its officers or employees shall not be responsible for the accuracy of materials submitted for review and do not guarantee that flood damage will not result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.100 Development permit required.

A. A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or development begins within any special flood hazard zone established in CMC 17.22.040. The permit shall be for all structures, including manufactured homes, as set forth in the definitions in Chapter 17.06 CMC and for all development including fill and other activities, also as set forth in the definitions in Chapter 17.06 CMC.

B. In addition to the standard development permit application, a JARPA application (see Appendix Chapter B) shall be required for any development or site work which is not constructed to the flood protection elevation within any flood hazard zone (the 100-year floodplain). If such application is not otherwise required to comply with Chapter 17.18 or 17.24 CMC, no fee shall be required for a JARPA form submitted only to satisfy the requirement in this section for such information. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.110 Use of other base flood data.

When base flood elevation data has not been provided on official maps, the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, local, or other source, including topographic data, in order to administer this chapter, including application of such information to subdivisions and other proposed development. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.120 Information to be obtained and maintained.

A. Where base flood elevation is provided through the flood insurance study, the developer shall provide to the building official the actual elevation, certified by a licensed land surveyor (in relation to mean sea level), of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement. The building official shall maintain this elevation certificate in a permanent file.

B. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required:

1. The developer shall provide to the building official the actual elevation, certified by a licensed land surveyor. The building official shall obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and

2. The building official shall maintain such floodproofing certifications.

C. The building official shall maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to development within the flood hazard zone. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.130 Variance criteria (flood hazard zone).

A. Generally, a variance from the elevation standard may be issued by the hearing examiner for new construction, additions, and substantial improvements of habitable structures to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level; and provided, that floodproofing is required as a condition of such a variance. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Generally, variance requests for habitable structures shall be heard and decided by the hearing examiner; however, the administrator may grant flood elevation variances under the following circumstances:

1. The examiner has previously granted a flood elevation variance for the subject property, and the conditions of record, if any, are incorporated into the conditions attached to the subject proposal;

2. The administrator finds that the proposal is consistent with the policies outlined in CMC 17.22.020, and with the development requirements of this section through CMC 17.22.190;

3. The methods of floodproofing are reasonable and afford maximum protection from flood damage, and are consistent with any conditions of record;

4. The applicant must attend a DRC meeting where the variance criteria and the notice to the applicant are made a matter of public record.

C. Generally, a variance from the elevation standard may be issued by the administrator for nonhabitable accessory structures if:

1. The administrator finds that the proposal is consistent with the policies outlined in CMC 17.22.020, and with the development requirements of this section through CMC 17.22.190;

2. The methods of floodproofing are reasonable and afford maximum protection from flood damage, and are consistent with any conditions of record;

3. The applicant must attend a DRC meeting where the variance criteria and the notice to the applicant are made a matter of public record.

D. Variances may be issued by the administrator for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

E. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway except for nonhabitable accessory structures designed by a licensed engineer to comply with all other applicable regulations in addition to this section.

F. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

G. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;



2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in CMC 17.22.020, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

H. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

I. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing (e.g., wet-floodproofing) where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other applicable variance criteria, and otherwise complies with CMC 17.22.140 and 17.22.150.

J. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.140 Anchoring.

All structures, including manufactured homes, must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement and shall be constructed or installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Anchoring methods which are not described in the adopted edition of the uniform codes shall be engineered. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.150 Construction materials and methods.

A. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

B. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

C. Electrical, heating, ventilation, ductwork, and air-conditioning equipment and other similar service facilities shall be elevated or otherwise located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding to the required flood protection elevation.

D. Additional Requirements for Below-Grade Crawlspaces (FEMA Technical Bulletin (TB) 11-01).

1. The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in Figure 3 of TB 11-01;

2. The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall, must not exceed four feet (shown as L in Figure 3 of TB 11-01) at any point for unsupported wall height of plain masonry walls. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height of plain masonry walls according to the engineering analyses and International Building Code requirements for flood hazard areas;

3. There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means;

4. The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five feet per second, other foundation types should be used;

5. Below-grade crawlspace construction in accordance with the requirements listed above will not be considered basements. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.160 Utilities.

A. All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems.

B. New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters.

C. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.

D. On-site water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.170 Flood protection elevation.

A. Development within special flood hazard areas which requires elevation or floodproofing shall be elevated or floodproofed to or above the flood protection elevation (base flood elevation plus one foot or base flood elevation plus three feet for critical facilities), or to the flood of record elevation at the specific location as identified by the city, whichever minimum elevation is higher.

B. Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgement and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.180 Residential construction.

A. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood protection elevation as described in CMC 17.22.170.

B. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

1. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the lowest grade; and

3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters, and do not become obstructed during a flood event. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.190 Nonresidential construction.

New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood protection elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

A. Be floodproofed so that below the flood protection elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

B. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

C. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this section based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the building official;

D. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in CMC 17.22.180(B); and

E. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level). [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.200 Manufactured homes.

All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at the flood protection elevation as described in CMC 17.22.170 and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system (CMC 17.22.140). [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.210 Critical facilities.

A. Critical facilities should be afforded additional flood protection due to their nature.

B. Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the 100-year floodplain as identified on the city’s FIRM. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the 100-year frequency floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the 100-year frequency floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet or more above the level of the 100-year frequency floodplain. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters.

C. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the 100-year frequency floodplain shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.220 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. New development, substantial improvements and other development may be allowed only if certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; and

B. All new development and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this title and applicable state and federal regulations. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.225 Alteration of watercourses.

A. The city shall notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.

B. Any approval of any alteration or relocation of any watercourse shall include a program of maintenance of such watercourse so that the flood- carrying capacity is not diminished. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.230 Special flood hazard areas with designated floodways.

When a regulatory floodway for a stream has been designated, the following shall apply:

A. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures shall be prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

1. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

2. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

a. Before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement is started; or

b. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

B. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary, or to structures identified as historic places, shall not be included in the 50 percent determination. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.240 Special flood hazard areas without designated floodways.

When a regulatory floodway or stream has not been designated, the following shall apply:

A. Applicants for new construction and substantial improvements shall reasonably utilize the best available information from a federal, state, and/or other source to:

1. Consider the cumulative effect of existing, proposed, and anticipated future development; and

2. Determine that the increase in water surface elevation of the base flood will not be more than one foot at any point in the community.

B. Building and development near streams without a designated floodway shall comply with the requirements of:

1. Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations; and

2. The National Flood Insurance Program regulations. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]


17.22.250 Standards for shallow flood areas (AO zones).

Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRM as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

A. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, to one foot above the depth number specified in the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);

B. New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within the AO zones shall either:

1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to one foot above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, or one foot above the depth number specified in the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to the flood protection elevation so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;

C. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. [Ord. 849B § 3, 2009.]

17.23.010 Designation. 

A. Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Swamps, marshes, bogs, and wet meadows/pastures are examples of wetland. Some riparian areas adjacent to streams are also wetland. 

B. Wetlands shall be identified in accordance with the requirements of RCW 36.70A.175 and 90.58.380. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter, all areas within the city meeting the criteria in the Washington State Wetland Identification and Delineation Manual (Ecology Publication 96-94), regardless of any formal identification, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. 

C. The approximate location and extent of known or suspected wetlands are shown on the city’s critical area maps. Other, unmapped wetlands may exist within the city. These maps are to be used as a guide and do not provide a definitive critical area designation. 

D. Wetlands shall be rated based on categories that reflect the functions and values of each wetland. Wetland categories shall be based on the criteria provided in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington, revised August 2004 (Ecology Publication No. 04-06-025). These categories are generally defined as follows: 

1. Category I Wetlands. Category I wetlands are those wetlands of exceptional value in terms of protecting water quality, storing flood and storm water, and/or providing habitat for wildlife as indicated by a rating system score of 70 points or more. These are wetland communities of infrequent occurrence that often provide documented habitat for critical, threatened or endangered species, and/or have other attributes that are very difficult or impossible to replace if altered. 

2. Category II Wetlands. Category II wetlands have significant value based on their function as indicated by a rating system score of between 51 and 69 points. They do not meet the criteria for Category I rating but occur infrequently and have qualities that are difficult to replace if altered. 

3. Category III Wetlands. Category III wetlands have important resource value as indicated by a rating system score of between 30 and 50 points. 

4. Category IV Wetlands. Category IV wetlands are wetlands of limited resource value as indicated by a rating system score of less than 30 points. They typically have vegetation of similar age and class, lack special habitat features, and/or are isolated or disconnected from other aquatic systems or high quality upland habitats. [Ord. 849B § 4, 2009.]


17.23.020 Review and reporting requirements. 

A. If the project site is within 300 feet of a National Wetland Index mapped area, the director shall require a site evaluation (field investigation) by a qualified professional to determine whether or not a regulated wetland is present and if so, its relative location in relation to the proposed project area on site. If the director determines that a wetland is more likely than not present, the director shall require a critical area study. If no regulated wetlands are present, then wetland review will be considered complete. 

B. A critical area study (wetland assessment study) describes the characteristics of the subject property and adjacent areas. The assessment shall be completed pursuant to CMC 17.21.082 and include the following: 

1. Existing physical features of the site including buildings, fences, and other structures, roads, parking lots, utilities, water bodies, etc.; 

2. Determination of the wetland category and wetland buffers; 

3. Field identification and delineation of wetland boundaries. For on-site wetlands, the assessment shall include the dominant and subdominant plant species; soil type, color and texture; sources of hydrology (patterns of surface and subsurface water movement, precipitation, etc.), topography, and other pertinent information; 

4. Identification of critical areas and buffers within 300 feet of the site and an estimate of the approximate acreage for each. The assessment of off-site wetlands shall be based on available information and shall not require accessing off-site properties; 

5. A detailed description of the effects of the proposed development on wetland and buffer function and value, including the area of direct wetland disturbance; area of buffer reduction or averaging including documentation that functions and values will not be adversely affected by the reduction or averaging; effects of storm water management; proposed hydrologic alteration including changes to natural drainage or infiltration patterns; effects on fish and wildlife species and their habitats; clearing and grading impacts; temporary construction impacts; and effects of increased noise, light or human intrusion;

6. A mitigation plan, if applicable. [Ord. 849B § 4, 2009.]


17.23.030 Buffers.

A. Wetland buffer zones shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to regulated wetlands. Any wetland created, restored or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored or enhanced wetland. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the wetland buffer zone shall be determined according to wetland category. Buffers shall not include areas that are functionally and effectively disconnected from the wetland by a road or other substantially developed surface of sufficient width and with use characteristics such that buffer functions are not provided. 

B. The buffer standards required by this chapter presume the existence of a dense vegetation community in the buffer adequate to protect the wetland functions and values. When a buffer lacks adequate vegetation, the director may increase the standard buffer, require buffer planting or enhancement, and/or deny a proposal for buffer reduction or buffer averaging. 

C. Buffer Dimensions.

	 	Low Wildlife Function (less than 20 points)	Moderate Wildlife Function (20 – 26 points)	High Wildlife Function (27 or more points)

	Wetland Category	Buffer Width (feet)

	Category IV	50	50	501

	Category III	80	100	1501

17.23.053 Mitigation. 

Activities that adversely affect wetlands and/or wetland buffers shall include mitigation sufficient to achieve no net loss of wetland function and values in accordance with CMC 17.21.087 and this section. 

A. Wetland Alterations. Compensatory mitigation shall be provided for all wetland alternation and shall reestablish, create, rehabilitate, enhance, and/or preserve equivalent wetland functions and values. Compensation for wetland alterations shall occur in the following order of preference: 

1. Reestablishing wetlands on upland sites that were formerly wetlands. 

2. Rehabilitating wetlands for the purposes of repairing or restoring natural and/or historic functions. 

3. Creating wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those consisting primarily of nonnative, invasive plant species. 

4. Enhancing significantly degraded wetlands. 

5. Preserving Category I or II wetlands that are under imminent threat; provided, that preservation shall only be allowed in combination with other forms of mitigation and when the director determines that the overall mitigation package fully replaces the functions and values lost due to development. 

B. Mitigation Ratios. Compensatory mitigation for wetland alterations shall be based on the wetland category and the type of mitigation activity proposed. The replacement ratio shall be determined according to the ratios provided in the table below; provided, that replacement ratio for preservation shall be determined by the director on a case-by-case basis. The created, reestablished, rehabilitated, or enhanced wetland area shall at a minimum provide a level of function equivalent to the wetland being altered and shall be located in an appropriate landscape setting.

	Wetland Mitigation Type and Replacement Ratio*

	Wetland Category	Creation	Reestablishment	Rehabilitation	Enhancement Only

	Category IV	1.5:1	1.5:1	2:1	3:1

	Category III	2:1	2:1	3:1	4:1

	Category II	3:1	3:1	4:1	6:1

	Category I	6:1	6:1	8:1	Not allowed

*    Ratio is the replacement area:impact area.

C. Compensation for wetland buffer impacts shall occur at a minimum 1:1 ratio. Compensatory mitigation for buffer impacts shall include enhancement of degraded buffers by planting native species, removing structures and impervious surfaces within buffers, and other measures. 

D. Mitigation banks shall not be subject to the replacement ratios outlined in the replacement ratio table in subsection (B) of this section, but shall be determined as part of the mitigation banking agreement and certification process. 

E. Buffers. Replacement wetlands established pursuant to these mitigation provisions shall have adequate buffers to ensure their protection and sustainability. The buffer shall be based on the category in CMC 17.23.030; provided, that the director shall have the authority to approve a smaller buffer when existing site constraints (such as a road) prohibit attainment of the standard buffer. 

F. Adjustment of Ratios. The director shall have the authority to adjust these ratios when a combination of mitigation approaches is proposed. In such cases, the area of altered wetland shall be replaced at a 1:1 ratio through reestablishment or creation, and the remainder of the area needed to meet the ratio can be replaced by enhancement at a 2:1 ratio. For example, impacts to one acre of a Category II wetland requiring a 3:1 ratio for creation can be compensated by creating one acre and enhancing four acres (instead of the additional two acres of creation that would otherwise be required). 

G. Location. Compensatory mitigation shall be provided on site or off site in the location that will provide the greatest ecological benefit and have the greatest likelihood of success; provided, that mitigation occurs as close as possible to the impact area and within the same watershed sub-basin as the permitted alteration.

H. Protection. All mitigation areas whether on or off site shall be permanently protected and managed to prevent degradation and ensure protection of critical area functions and values into perpetuity. Permanent protection shall be achieved through deed restriction or other protective covenant in accordance with CMC 17.21.085. 

I. Timing. Mitigation activities shall be timed to occur in the appropriate season based on weather and moisture conditions and shall occur as soon as possible after the permitted alteration. [Ord. 849B § 4, 2009.]

1. The rationale for site selection; 

2. General description and scaled drawings of the activities proposed including, but not limited to, clearing, grading/excavation, drainage alterations, planting, invasive plant management, installation of habitat structures, irrigation, and other site treatments associated with the development activities and proposed mitigation action(s); 

3. A description of the ecological functions and values that the proposed alteration will affect and the specific ecological functions and values the proposed mitigation area(s) shall provide, together with a description of required or recommended mitigation ratios and an assessment of factors that may affect the success of the mitigation program; 

4. Overall goals of the plan, including wetland function, value, and acreage; 

5. Description of baseline (existing) site conditions including topography, vegetation, soils, hydrology, habitat features (i.e., snags), surrounding land use, and other pertinent information; 

6. Field data confirming the presence of adequate hydrology (surface and/or groundwater) to support existing and compensatory wetland area(s); 

7. Nature of mitigation activities, including area of restored, created, enhanced and preserved wetland, by wetland type; 

8. Detailed grading and planting plans showing proposed post-construction topography; general hydrologic patterns; spacing and distribution of plant species, size and type of proposed planting stock, watering or irrigation plans, and other pertinent information; 

9. A description of site treatment measures including invasive species removal, use of mulch and fertilizer, placement of erosion and sediment control devices, and best management practices that will be used to protect existing wetlands and desirable vegetation; 

10. A demonstration that the site will have adequate buffers sufficient to protect the wetland functions into perpetuity. 

C. Specific measurable performance standards that the proposed mitigation action(s) shall achieve together with a description of how the mitigation action(s) will be evaluated and monitored to determine if the performance standards are being met and identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates that project performance standards are not being met. The performance standards shall be tied to and directly related to the mitigation goals and objectives. 

D. Cost estimates for the installation of the mitigation program, monitoring, and potential corrective actions if project performance standards are not being met. [Ord. 849B § 4, 2009.]


17.23.055 Mitigation monitoring. 

A. All compensatory mitigation projects shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but generally not for a period less than five years. Reports shall be submitted annually for the first three years following construction and at the completion of years five, seven, and 10 if applicable to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensatory mitigation. The director shall have the authority to modify or extend the monitoring period and require additional monitoring reports for up to 10 years when any of the following conditions apply: 

1. The project does not meet the performance standards identified in the mitigation plan. 

2. The project does not provide adequate replacement for the functions and values of the impacted critical area.

3. The project involves establishment of forested plant communities, which require longer time for establishment. 

B. Mitigation monitoring reports shall include information sufficient to document and assess the degree of mitigation success or failure as defined by the performance standards contained in the approved mitigation plan. Information to be provided in annual monitoring reports shall include the following: 

1. Number and location of vegetation sample plots used to document compliance with performance standards; 

2. Measurements of the percent survival of planted material, plant cover, stem density, presence of invasive species, or other attributes;

4. Representative photographs of the site; 

5. A written summary of overall site conditions and recommendations for maintenance actions if needed; 

6. Other information that the director deems necessary to ensure the success of the site. [Ord. 849B § 4, 2009.]


17.23.056 Development standards. 

A. Development standards for adjacent development shall minimize adverse effects on the wetland, and shall include: 

1. Subdivision of land shall assure that each lot has sufficient building area outside wetlands and buffers. Lots in subdivisions shall be oriented whenever feasible to provide a rear yard of at least 20 feet between the buffer area and buildings. 

2. Fencing shall be provided at the perimeter of residential development to limit domestic animal entry into wetlands and buffer areas. 

3. Activities that generate noise shall be located as far from the wetland and buffer as feasible. Roads, driveways, parking lots and loading areas, mechanical or ventilating equipment shall be located on sides of buildings away from the wetland, or separated by noise attenuating walls.

4. Light penetration into buffer areas and wetlands shall be limited by locating areas requiring exterior lighting away from the wetland boundary, or limiting light mounting heights to a maximum of four feet. Windows that will be lit at night should be minimized on the side of buildings facing wetlands and buffers, or screened as provided for in subsection (C) of this section.

B. Management of surface runoff from adjacent land shall minimize adverse effects on wetland ecological functions and shall include: 

1. Control of surface water peak flow and duration of flow should be maintained at rates typical of native forest cover.

2. Runoff should be routed to infiltration systems, to the maximum extent feasible, to provide groundwater interflow recharge to wetlands and/or water bodies and to limit overland flow and erosion. 

3. Surface or piped storm water should be routed to existing conveyances or to other areas, wherever hydraulic gradients allow. Where storm water is routed to wetlands, system design shall assure that erosion and sedimentation will be avoided to the maximum extent feasible. 

4. To prevent channelized flow from lawns and other landscaped areas from entering the buffer, and to prevent washing of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides into the buffer, if slopes adjacent to the buffer exceed 15 percent, a 10-foot-wide swale to intercept runoff or other effective interception facility approved by the director shall be provided at the edge of the buffer. 

5. Adopt and implement an integrated pest management system including limiting use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides within 25 feet of the buffer. 

C. In order to maintain effective buffer conditions and functions, a vegetation management plan shall be required for all buffer areas, to include: 

1. Maintaining adequate cover of native vegetation including trees and understory; if existing tree cover is less than a relative density of 20, planting shall be required consisting of seedlings at a density of 300 stems per acre or the equivalent; 

2. Provide a dense screen of native evergreen trees at the perimeter of the buffer. If existing vegetation is not sufficient to prevent viewing adjacent development from within the buffer. Planting shall be required equivalent to two rows of three-foot-high stock of native evergreens at a triangular spacing of 15 feet, or three rows of gallon containers at a triangular spacing of eight feet. Fencing may be required if needed to block headlights or other sources of light or to provide an immediate effective visual screen;

3. Provide a plan for control of invasive weeds, and remove existing invasive species; 

4. Provide for a monitoring and maintenance plan for a period of at least five years, except this provision may be waived for single-family residential lots. [Ord. 849B § 4, 2009.]

Seismic hazards shall be as identified in Washington State Department of Natural Resources seismic hazard maps for Western Washington and other geologic resources. [Ord. 849B § 5, 2009.]


17.24.020 Development standards for landslide hazard areas. 

Uses and activities in landslide hazard areas shall conform to the following standards: 

A. Protection of Landslide Area and Buffer. The landslide hazard area and associated buffer shall be protected from disturbance, except in compliance with the standards of this section. Modification of topography and vegetation in landslide hazard areas shall be stringently limited to provide multiple benefits of long-term stability of sensitive slopes and related benefits including reduction of erosion potential, reduction of storm water runoff, and preservation of related ecological values. Unless otherwise provided or as part of an approved alteration, removal of vegetation from a landslide hazard area or related buffer shall be prohibited. If the designated landslide hazard and buffer area lacks adequate woody vegetation to provide for stability, the director shall have the authority to require vegetation restoration or other measures to improve slope stability. 

B. A buffer shall be established from all edges of landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined as follows to minimize or eliminate the risk of property damage, death, or injury and effects on other elements of the environment resulting from earth movement caused in whole or part by the development: 

1. The buffer from the top of a slope shall be designed to protect persons and property from damage due to catastrophic slope failure and slope retreat over the lifetime of the use and provide an area of vegetation to promote shallow stability, control erosion and promote multiple benefits to wildlife and other resources. The minimum dimension of the buffer shall be equal to the greater of: 

a. The distance from the top of slope equal to the vertical distance from the toe of slope to the top of slope; 

b. The distance from the top of slope equal to the distance from the toe of slope upslope at a slope of 2:1 (horizontal to vertical) to a point that intersects with the site’s ground elevation; or 

c. Fifty feet from the top of the slope. 

2. The minimum buffer from the bottom of a slope shall provide for safety of persons and property from the run-out resulting from slope failure and shall be the greater of: 

a. The height of the slope; or 

b. Fifty feet from the toe of the slope. 

3. Buffer Reduction. The buffer may be reduced to a minimum of 10 feet based on analysis of specific development plans provided by a qualified professional that demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction that the reduction will adequately protect the proposed development, adjacent developments, and uses and other nearby critical areas. 

4. Increased Buffer. The buffer may be increased where the director determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed and existing development. 

C. Development Standards.

1. Division of land within or adjacent to landslide hazard areas and associated buffers shall be clustered to avoid landslide hazard areas and associated buffers. Land that is located partially within a landslide hazard area or its buffer may be divided; provided, that each resulting lot has sufficient buildable area outside of the landslide area and buffer with provision for drainage, erosion control and related features that will not adversely affect the stability of the landslide area. 

2. Alteration of a landslide hazard area and buffer in order to accommodate structures or land alteration may be authorized only in cases where the director finds that reasonable development cannot be accommodated on portions of the site not subject to landslide hazards and buffers, and if analysis by a qualified professional establishes compliance with the following standards, based on specific development plans: 

a. The proposed development will not result in a risk of landslide that may affect development on the subject property or other properties in the vicinity, and will not result in a greater risk or a need for increased buffers on neighboring properties. For unconsolidated deposits, development shall not decrease the factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.5 for static conditions and 1.2 for dynamic conditions. Analysis of dynamic conditions shall be based on a minimum horizontal acceleration as established by the current version of the International Building Code. 

b. Measures to maintain slope stability, such as drainage systems, must be of a design that will assure operation without facilities requiring regular maintenance that would jeopardize stability if the facility fails. 

c. The development will not increase erosion or sedimentation risk on the site.

d. The development will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond pre-development conditions.

e. Such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas.

f. Structures shall be located on the least sensitive portion of the site and clustered where possible to reduce disturbance and removal of vegetation. 

g. Grading shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope.

h. Foundations should conform to the natural contours of the slope and foundations should be stepped/tiered where possible to conform to existing topography of the site.

i. Retaining walls shall be preferred over cut and fill and shall be incorporated into structures wherever feasible. 

j. Landslide hazard areas on unconsolidated deposits with a gradient of 40 percent where the toe of slope is within the buffer area of a wetland, stream, pond or lake are not eligible for alteration of landslide hazard areas or but may be subject to alteration of buffers, subject to compliance with the standards of this chapter. 

3. Critical facilities, including, but not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, and installations that produce, use, or store hazardous materials shall not be located in landslide hazard areas if there is a feasible alternative location outside the hazardous areas that would serve the intended service population. A facility may be allowed only subject to the standards in subsection (C)(2) of this section.

4. Utility lines and pipes shall be permitted in erosion and landslide hazard areas only when the applicant demonstrates that no other practical alternative is available. The line or pipe shall be located above ground and properly anchored and/or designed so that it will continue to function in the event of an underlying slide. Storm water conveyance shall be allowed only through a high-density polyethylene pipe with fuse-welded joints, or similar product that is technically equal or superior.

5. Point discharges from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or upgradient from an erosion or landslide hazard area shall be prohibited. 

6. Roads, driveways and other vehicular access, trails and walkways, may be permitted only if the applicant demonstrates that no other feasible alternative exists, including through the provisions of Chapter 8.24 RCW and subject to the standards in subsection (C)(2) of this section. If access through a hazard area is granted, exceptions or deviations from technical standards for width or other dimensions, and specific construction standards to minimize impacts may be specified. Access roads and trails shall be engineered and built to standards that avoid the need for major repair or reconstruction beyond that which would be required in non-hazard areas and shall be: 

a. Located in the least sensitive area of the site. 

b. Designed to minimize topographic modification with low gradients and/or parallel to the natural contours of the site. 

c. Retaining walls shall be preferred over cut and fill slopes to minimize topographic modification. 

d. Clearing and grading shall minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent feasible to accommodate allowed development and generally shall not extend more than 10 feet beyond the approved development.

D. A qualified professional, licensed in the state of Washington, shall review projects in geologically hazardous areas to ensure that they are properly designed and constructed. [Ord. 849B § 5, 2009.]


17.24.030 Development standards for erosion hazard areas.

A. Within erosion hazard areas disturbance of natural vegetation shall be limited. The following chart sets forth the maximum disturbance allowed on a site: 

Amount of Slope Which Can Be Disturbed

	Slope	Disturbance Allowed

	0 to 15 percent	100 percent

	15 to 25 percent	60 percent

	25 to 40 percent	45 percent

	Greater than 40 percent	0 percent

1. The overall disturbance allowed on development sites which have any combination of the above slope categories shall be determined by the following formula: (square footage of the site having 0 to 15 percent slopes) times 1.00 plus (square footage of site having 15 to 25 percent slopes) times .60 plus (square footage of site having 25 to 40 percent slopes) times .45 equals total allowable site disturbance. 

2. Areas protected as critical areas by other provisions of this chapter shall be eliminated from the calculation of allowed site disturbance in this subsection. 

3. The total allowable site disturbance limits shall be applied to the entire site and shall include all disturbance over the life of the project. 

4. The disturbed area of the site shall be located within areas of the least sensitive portions of the site. 

5. Areas to be preserved as undisturbed shall be located on site plans and protected from disturbance during construction and use. Areas to be preserved in subdivisions shall be indicated on the face of the plat in accordance with CMC 17.21.085, Notice on title. Disturbance limits shall be observed in subsequent development of lots. 

6. Disturbance limits shall not be applied to existing single-family residential lots less than 20,000 square feet in size that were created prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 

B. Structures shall be located on the least sensitive portion of the site and clustered where possible to reduce disturbance and removal of vegetation. 

C. Grading shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope. Building foundations shall conform to the natural contours of the slope and be stepped/tiered to conform to existing topography of the site.

D. Retaining walls shall be preferred over cut and fill for roads, parking lots and structures. Structures on slopes in excess of 25 percent shall incorporate earth retaining structures in buildings rather than employing free-standing earth retention structures. Clearing and grading shall minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent feasible and generally shall not extend more than 10 feet beyond the approved development.

E. All structures or impervious surface improvements shall a be required to have on-site drainage systems to meet the specifications of the public works department to control conveyance of storm water to avoid erosion hazard areas. Point discharges or overland dispersion systems from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or upstream from an erosion or landslide hazard area shall be prohibited from discharging onto slopes in excess of five percent. Conveyance should be provided to the foot of slopes.

F. Roads, driveways and other vehicular access, trails and walkways shall be:

1. Located in the least sensitive area of the site. 

2. Designed to minimize topographic modification with low gradients and/or parallel to the natural contours of the site. 

3. Retaining walls shall be preferred over cut and fill slopes to minimize topographic modification. 

G. Logging activity allowed on slope exceeding 25 percent shall be partial cutting only and not clear cutting. “Partial cutting” is defined here as per WAC 222-16-010. In addition, subsequent harvest shall not create a condition inconsistent with that definition. Timber harvest in these areas shall be consistent with all applicable laws including but not limited to Chapter 222-30 WAC, Timber Harvesting, Chapter 222-34 WAC, Reforestation, and Chapter 222-38 WAC, Forest Chemicals. [Ord. 849B § 5, 2009.]


17.24.040 Seismic hazard areas standards. 

Development may be allowed in seismic hazard areas when all of the following apply: 

A. If evaluation of site-specific subsurface conditions by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed development site is not subject to the conditions indicating seismic risk, the provisions of this section shall not apply. 

B. If a site is subject to seismic risk, the applicant shall implement appropriate engineering design based on analysis by a qualified professional of the best available engineering and geological practices that either eliminates or minimizes the risk of structural damage or injury resulting from seismically induced settlement or soil liquefaction, including compliance with the following criteria: 

1. Subdivision within seismic hazard areas shall assure that each resulting lot has sufficient buildable area outside of the hazard area or that appropriate limitations on building and reference to appropriate standards are incorporated into subdivision approval and may be placed as restrictions on the face of the plat; 

2. Structures in seismic hazard areas shall conform to applicable analysis and design criteria of the International Building Code; 

3. Public roads, bridges, utilities and trails shall be allowed when there are no feasible alternative locations and geotechnical analysis and design are provided that ensure the roadway, bridge and utility structures and facilities will not be susceptible to damage from seismic induced ground deformation.

17.25.020 Water bodies. 

A. Streams shall be designated in accordance with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) stream type as provided in WAC 222-16-030 with the following provisions: 

1. Type S Water. All waters inventoried as “shorelines of the state” under Chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW, including periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands. 

2. Type F-A Water. Segments of natural waters, other than Type S Waters, which are within defined channels greater than 10 feet in width, as defined by the OHWM and periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands or within lakes, ponds, or impoundments having a surface area of one-half acre or greater at seasonal low water and which in any case contain fish habitat. 

3. Type F-B Water. Segments of natural waters, other than Type S Waters, which are within defined channels less than 10 feet in width, as defined by the OHWM, or within lakes, ponds, or impoundments having a surface area of less than one-half acre at seasonal low water and which in any case contain fish habitat. 

4. Type Np Water. All segments of natural waters within defined channels that are perennial nonfish habitat streams. Perennial streams are waters that do not go dry any time of a year of normal rainfall. However, for the purpose of water typing, Type Np Waters include the intermittent dry portions of the perennial channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow. 

5. Type Ns Water. All segments of natural waters within defined channels that are not Type S, F, or Np Waters. These are seasonal, nonfish habitat streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall and are not located downstream from any stream reach that is a Type Np Water. Ns Waters must be physically connected by an aboveground channel system to Type S, F, or Np Waters. 

B. Nonfish habitat streams are those streams that have no known or potential use by anadromous or resident fish based on the stream character, hydrology and gradient; provided, that human-made barriers shall not be considered a limit on fish use except when the director makes the following findings: 

1. The human-made barrier is located beneath public infrastructure that is unlikely to be replaced and it is not feasible to remove the barrier without removing the public infrastructure; provided, that the infrastructure is not identified for future modification in the capital facility or other plans of the public agency responsible for the infrastructure, and the facility will not exceed its design life within the foreseeable future; 

2. The human-made barrier is located beneath one or more occupied structures and it is not feasible to remove the barrier without removing the structure, and the structure is of a size and condition that removal or substantial remodel is not likely; 

3. The human-made barrier is not identified for removal by a public agency or in an adopted watershed plan. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]


17.25.030 Water bodies – Buffers. 

The director shall have the authority to require buffers from the edges of all streams in accordance with the following: 

A. Buffers shall be established for activities adjacent to as necessary to protect the integrity, functions and values of the resource. Buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the species or habitat and the type and intensity of the adjacent human use or activity. Two systems of buffer dimensions are specified below: standard buffers and buffers based on specific water body reach characteristics and ecological functions. 

B. Standard Buffers. The standard buffer widths required by this section are based on scientific studies of the conditions necessary to sustain ecological functions and values to support anadromous and resident fish and presume the existence of a dense native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the stream functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. Buffers shall be measured as follows: 

1. Type S Water, all waters inventoried as “shorelines of the state” under the jurisdiction of the Shoreline Management Act, except associated wetlands, which shall be regulated in accordance with Chapter 17.23 CMC: 150 feet.

2. Type F-A Water, segments of natural waters other than Type S Waters which are greater than 10 feet in width: 150 feet.

3. Type F-B Water, segments of natural waters other than Type S Waters which are less than 10 feet in width: 100 feet.

4. Type Np Water, segments of natural waters that are perennial nonfish habitat streams: 75 feet.

5. Type Ns Water, segments of natural waters within defined channels that are seasonal, nonfish habitat streams: 50 feet.

6. Nonfish-bearing streams in existing subdivisions: 

a. Where streams have been placed in separate tracts, buffers will be provided by the tract, provided a minimum dimension of 25 feet from the edge of the stream is provided; 

b. Where streams have not been placed in separate tracts, or if a minimum dimension of 25 feet from the edge of the stream is not provided, buffers will meet the dimensional requirements in subsection (B)(4) of this section, unless existing structures are located within the buffer. In that case, the following provisions shall apply: 

i. An inner riparian buffer shall be provided with a dense community of native trees, shrubs, and groundcover. The dimension of this buffer shall be a minimum of 15 feet, and may be expanded if sufficient clearance is available between the stream and existing primary structures; 

ii. An outer riparian buffer may be provided to extend within 10 feet of an existing primary structure. Within the outer buffer, a maximum of 25 percent of the zone may be used as grass turf, with the balance a dense community of native trees, shrubs, and groundcover. 

C. Buffer Measurement. The buffer shall be measured landward horizontally on both sides of the water body from the ordinary high water mark as identified in the field perpendicular to the alignment of the stream or lake/pond bank. The required buffer shall be extended to include any adjacent regulated wetland(s), landslide hazard areas and/or erosion hazard areas and required buffers, but shall not be extended across roads or other lawfully established structures or hardened surfaces that are functionally and effectively disconnected from the stream. Where lands adjacent to a stream display an average continuous slope of 20 percent to 35 percent and the required buffer is less than 100 feet, the buffer shall extend to a 30 percent greater dimension. In all cases, where slopes within the required buffer exceed 35 percent, the buffer shall extend to a minimum dimension of 25 feet from the top of said slopes, or if a buffer associated with a geological hazard is present, to whichever extent is greater. 

D. Buffers in Conjunction with Other Critical Areas. Where other critical areas defined in this chapter fall within the water body buffer, the buffer area shall be the most expansive of the buffers applicable to any applicable critical area. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]

The director shall have the authority to average standard stream buffer widths on a case-by-case basis when the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that all the following criteria are met. Stream buffer averaging shall not be allowed if the performance-based stream buffers are implemented pursuant to CMC 17.25.030(C).

A. Averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met as demonstrated by an assessment study pursuant to CMC 17.21.082 and 17.25.060: 

1. The water body or buffer area has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions; 

2. The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more sensitive portion of the water body and decreased adjacent to the lower-functioning or less sensitive portion;

3. The buffer averaging does not reduce the functions or values of the stream or riparian habitat, or the buffer averaging, in conjunction with vegetation enhancement, increases the habitat function; 

4. The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging and all increases in buffer dimension for averaging are generally parallel to the wetland edge; 

5. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-fourths of the required width; 

6. The slopes adjacent to the stream within the buffer area are stable and the gradient does not exceed 30 percent. 

B. Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following are met as demonstrated by an assessment study pursuant to CMC 17.21.082 and 17.25.060: 

1. There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging; 

2. The buffer averaging does not reduce the functions or values of the stream or riparian habitat, or the buffer averaging, in conjunction with vegetation enhancement, increases the habitat function;

4. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than three-fourths of the required width except where the director finds that there is an existing feature such as a roadway that limits buffer dimension, or an essential element of a proposed development such as access that must be accommodated for reasonable use and requires a smaller buffer. 

C. The applicant implements all reasonable measures to reduce the adverse effects of adjacent land uses and ensure no net loss of functions and values in conjunction with a critical area mitigation study. The specific measures that shall be implemented include but are not limited to those in CMC 17.25.080. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]

B. Compensate for degraded vegetation communities or steep slopes adjacent to the stream. 

C. Maintain areas for channel migration. 

D. Protect adjacent or downstream areas from erosion, landslides, or other hazards. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]


17.25.040 Water bodies – Allowed uses. 

The following activities or uses may be permitted in streams and/or their buffers when all reasonable measures have been taken to avoid adverse effects on species and habitats, the amount and degree of the alteration are limited to the minimum needed to accomplish the project purpose, and compensatory mitigation is provided for all adverse impacts that cannot be avoided:

Bridges are preferred for all stream crossings and should be designed to maintain the existing stream gradient and substrate, provide adequate horizontal clearance on each side of the ordinary high water mark and adequate vertical clearance above ordinary high water mark for animal passage. If a bridge crossing is not feasible, culverts shall be designed according to applicable state and federal guidance criteria for fish passage as identified in Fish Passage Design at Road Culverts, WDFW March 1999, and/or the National Marine Fisheries Service Guidelines for Salmonid Passage at Stream Crossings, 2000 (and subsequent revisions), and in accordance with a state hydraulic project approval. The applicant or property owner shall maintain fish passage through bridge or culvert. 

3. The city may require that existing culverts be removed, repaired, or modified as a condition of approval if the culvert is detrimental to fish habitat or water quality, and a feasible alternative exists. 

4. Crossings shall be limited to the minimum width necessary. Common crossings are the preferred approach where multiple properties can be accessed by one crossing. 

5. Access to private development sites may be permitted to cross streams, if there are no feasible alternative alignments. Alternative access shall be pursued to the maximum extent feasible, including through the provisions of Chapter 8.24 RCW. Exceptions or deviations from technical standards for width or other dimensions, and specific construction standards to minimize impacts may be specified, including placement on elevated structures as an alternative to fill, if feasible.

2. Adverse impact to fish or wildlife habitat conservation areas, specifically juvenile and adult fish migration corridors, or associated wetlands will be mitigated;

3. Nonstructural measures, such as placing or relocating the development further from the shoreline, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient; 

4. Stabilization is achieved through bioengineering or soft armoring techniques in accordance with an applicable hydraulic project approval issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; 

5. Hard bank armoring may occur only when the property contains an existing permanent structure(s) that is in danger from shoreline erosion caused by riverine processes and not erosion caused by upland conditions, such as the alteration of natural vegetation or drainage, and the armoring shall not increase erosion on adjacent properties and shall not eliminate or reduce sediment supply.

17.25.050 Other fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. 

A. Definition and Buffers. Protection standards for fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas other than streams and lakes are as provided in the table below.

	Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Area	Buffer Requirement

	Areas with which federally listed threatened or endangered species have a primary association.

State priority habitats and areas with which priority species have a primary association.

A “primary association” means a critical component(s) of the habitats of a species, which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term.	Buffers shall be based on recommendations provided by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife PHS Program; provided, that where no such recommendations are available, the buffer width shall be determined based on published literature concerning the species/habitat(s) in question and/or the opinions and recommendations of qualified professional with appropriate expertise.

	Natural area preserves and natural resource conservation areas.	Buffers shall be based on recommendations provided by site managers; provided, that the management strategies are considered effective and within the scope of this chapter.

	Locally important habitat areas.	The need for and dimensions of buffers for locally important species or habitats shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, according to the needs of specific species or habitat area of concern. The director shall coordinate with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and other state, federal or tribal experts in these instances, and shall use WDFW PHS management recommendations when available.

B. Alterations that occur within a locally important habitat area or that may affect a locally important species as defined herein shall be subject to review on a case-by-case basis. The director shall have the authority to require an assessment of the effects of the alteration on species or habitats and may require mitigation to ensure that adverse effects do not occur. This standard is intended to allow for flexibility and responsiveness with regard to locally important species and habitats. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]


17.25.060 Review and reporting requirements.

A. When critical area maps or Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife priority species and habitat information, or other sources of credible information, indicate that a site proposed for development or alteration is more likely than not to contain fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas or be within the buffer of a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, the director shall require a site evaluation (field investigation) by a qualified professional or other measures to determine whether or not the species or habitat is present and if so, its relative location in relation to the proposed project area or site. If no fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are present, then review will be considered complete. If the site evaluation determines that the species or habitat is present, the director may require a critical areas assessment report. 

B. The director may waive the report requirement for a single-family development that involves less than 2,000 square feet of clearing and/or vegetation removal and will not directly disturb the designated stream or pond buffer area, designated species, or specific areas or habitat features that comprise the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area (nest trees, breeding sites, etc.) as indicated by a site plan or scaled drawing of the proposed development, except in the case of a project site situated within 800 feet of an established eagle’s nest. In this case, an approved bald eagle management plan by the Washington Department of Wildlife meeting the requirements and guidelines of the bald eagle protection rules (WAC 232-12-292), as now or hereafter amended must be filed with the city’s community development department. 

C. The critical areas report shall describe the characteristics of the subject property and adjacent areas. The assessment shall include the following: 

1. Existing physical features of the site including buildings, fences, and other structures, roads, parking lots, utilities, water bodies, etc.; 

2. Determination of the resource category and standard buffers; 

3. Identification of critical areas and buffers within 300 feet of the site and an estimate of the existing approximate acreage for each. The assessment of off-site resources shall be based on available information and shall not require accessing off-site properties if permission of the property owner cannot be obtained; 

4. Proposed development activity;

5. A detailed description of the effects of the proposed development on ecological functions and buffer function and value, including the area of direct disturbance; area of buffer reduction or averaging including documentation that functions and values will not be adversely affected by the reduction or averaging; effects of storm water management; proposed hydrologic alteration, including changes to natural drainage or infiltration patterns; effects on fish and wildlife species and their habitats; clearing and grading impacts; temporary construction impacts; and effects of increased noise, light or human intrusion;

6. Provisions to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts of the proposed development activities including, but not limited to: 

a. Clustering and buffering of development;

b. Retention of native vegetation;

c. Access limitations, including fencing;

d. Seasonal restrictions on construction activities in accordance with the guidelines developed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the salmonid recovery plan and/or other agency or tribe with expertise and jurisdiction over the subject species/habitat; 

e. Methods to reduce proximity impacts; and

f. Other appropriate and proven low impact development techniques. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]


17.25.070 Mitigation standards. 

A. Activities that adversely affect fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and/or their buffers should generally be avoided through site design, including clustering. Unavoidable impacts to designated species or habitats shall be compensated for through habitat creation, restoration and/or enhancement to achieve no net loss of habitat functions and values in accordance with the purpose and goals of this chapter.

B. When compensatory mitigation is required, the applicant shall submit a mitigation plan with sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed activities are logistically feasible, constructible, ecologically sustainable, and likely to succeed. Specific information to be provided in the plan shall include, but not be limited to: 

1. General description and scaled drawings of the activities proposed including, but not limited to, clearing, grading/excavation, drainage alterations, planting, invasive plant management, installation of habitat structures, irrigation, and other site treatments associated with the development activities and proposed mitigation action(s); 

2. A description of the functions and values that the proposed mitigation area(s) shall provide, together with a description of required and an assessment of factors that may affect the success of the mitigation program; and 

3. A description of known management objectives for the species or habitat. 

C. Required mitigation shall be completed as soon as possible following activities that will disturb fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and during the appropriate season. Mitigation shall be completed prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing wildlife and flora. 

D. The director shall have authority to require monitoring of mitigation activities and submittal of annual monitoring reports to ensure and document that the goals and objectives of the mitigation are met. The frequency and duration of the monitoring shall be based on the specific needs of the project as determined by the mitigation plan. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]


17.25.080 Development standards for adjacent development. 

A. Development standards for adjacent development shall minimize adverse effects on the fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, including water bodies, and shall include: 

1. Subdivision of land shall assure that each lot has sufficient building area outside conservation areas and buffers. Lots in subdivisions shall be oriented whenever feasible to provide a rear yard of at least 20 feet between the buffer area and buildings. 

2. Fencing shall be provided at the perimeter of residential development to limit domestic animal entry into conservation areas and buffer areas. 

3. Activities that generate noise shall be located as far from the conservation areas and buffers as feasible. Roads, driveways, parking lots, loading areas, mechanical or ventilating equipment or shall be located on sides of buildings away from the conservation areas, or separated by noise attenuating walls.

4. Light penetration into buffer areas and the water body shall be limited by locating areas requiring exterior lighting away from the conservation areas boundary, or limiting light mounting heights to a maximum of four feet. Windows that will be lit at night should be minimized on the side of buildings facing conservation areas and buffers, or screened as provided in subsection (C) of this section. 

B. Management of surface runoff from adjacent land shall minimize adverse effects on fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas’ ecological functions and shall include: 

1. Control of surface water peak flow and duration of flow should be maintained at rates typical of native forest cover.

2. Runoff should be routed to infiltration systems, to the maximum extent feasible, to provide groundwater interflow recharge to water bodies and to limit overland flow and erosion. 

3. Surface or piped storm water should be routed to existing conveyances or to other areas, wherever hydraulic gradients allow. Where storm water is routed to water bodies, system design shall assure that erosion and sedimentation will be avoided to the maximum extent feasible. 

4. To prevent channelized flow from lawns and other landscaped areas from entering the buffer, and to prevent washing of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides into the buffer, if slopes adjacent to the buffer exceed 15 percent, a 10-foot-wide swale to intercept runoff or other effective interception facility approved by the director shall be provided at the edge of the buffer. 

5. Adopt and apply integrated pest management system including limiting use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides within 25 feet of buffers to water bodies. 

C. In order to maintain effective buffer conditions and functions, a vegetation management plan shall be required for all buffer areas established to include: 

1. Maintaining adequate cover of native vegetation including trees and understory; if existing tree cover is less than a relative density of 20, planting shall be required consisting of seedlings at a density of 300 stems per acre or the equivalent; 

2. Provide a dense screen of native evergreen trees at the perimeter of the buffer. If existing vegetation is not sufficient to prevent viewing adjacent development from within the buffer, planting shall be required equivalent to two rows of three-foot-high stock of native evergreens at a triangular spacing of 15 feet or three rows of gallon containers at a triangular spacing of eight feet. Fencing may be required if needed to block headlights or other sources of light or to provide an immediate effective visual screen;

3. Provide a plan for control of invasive weeds, and remove existing invasive species; 

4. Provide for a monitoring and maintenance plan for a period of at least five years, except this provision may be waived for single-family residential lots. [Ord. 849B § 6, 2009.]

17.26.010 General authority. 

This chapter is adopted under the authority of RCW 36.70A.020. [Ord. 849B § 7, 2009.]


17.26.020 Purpose. 

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate development and the use of land in critical aquifer recharge area (CARA) in order to ensure long-term protection of the water supply resources that exist under the city’s jurisdiction; and to comply with the Washington State Growth Management Act. [Ord. 849B § 7, 2009.]


17.26.030 Applicability. 

A. Critical aquifer recharge areas are areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water. These areas can fall within the city’s jurisdiction where the prevailing geologic conditions allow infiltration rates which create a high potential for contamination of groundwater resources or contribute to the replenishment of groundwater. Critical aquifer recharge areas are rated as having high, moderate, or low susceptibility to contamination based on soil permeability, geologic matrix, infiltration, and depth to water as determined by the criteria established by the state Department of Ecology. 

B. The approximate location and extent of critical aquifer recharge area and municipal wellhead protection areas are shown on the aquifer protection overlay. This overlay is to identify and classify vulnerable aquifer recharge areas within the city’s jurisdiction. Protection of the aquifer within the critical aquifer recharge area is to be accomplished by controlling the use and handling of hazardous substances. Restrictions on development may be placed in order to protect public health and safety by preserving the existing and future groundwater supply for the city and urban growth area pursuant to the performance standards of CMC 17.26.040(H). [Ord. 849B § 7, 2009.]


17.26.040 Regulations. 

A. Activities may only be permitted in a critical aquifer recharge area if the community development director (director) determines that the proposed activity will not cause contaminants to enter the critical aquifer and that the proposed activity will not adversely affect the recharging of the critical aquifer. 

B. Any development which occurs within the city’s jurisdiction will use best management practices (BMPs) to prevent chemical and biological contaminants from entering underground waters and aquifers which are now, or in the future, likely to be used as a potable drinking water source. All persons, corporations, or other legal entities that engage in the construction of regulated facilities contained in this chapter must first obtain approval by the city through the critical area permit process and building permit(s). 

C. To obtain city water hookups and services for any real property in the critical aquifer recharge area, city sewer hookups and services are required in compliance with Chapter 12.04 CMC. This code allows the utilities director to review individual cases for exception to this restriction. If the utilities director has determined that new construction, any change in the intensity or use of land such as an increase in dwelling units or a change to a commercial or industrial use from a less intense use and/or subdivisions cannot connect to city sewer within the critical aquifer recharge area, then the projects shall require a hydrogeological assessment for their impact on the groundwater in the critical aquifer recharge area. State of the art alternative sewage disposal systems for denitrification shall be required in areas where there is the potential for nitrate loading to groundwater. Open spaces may be required overlying areas highly susceptible for contaminating groundwater resources. 

D. The proposed activity must comply with the water source protection requirements of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, state Department of Health, and the Lewis County environmental health department. 

E. Critical Aquifer Recharge Area Categories. Critical aquifer recharge areas regulated under this title may be established based on general criteria described in this chapter, specifically designated due to special circumstances, or based on scientific studies and mapping efforts. Factors considered in the identification of critical aquifer recharge areas include depth to water table, presence of highly permeable soils, presence of flat terrain, and the presence of more permeable surficial geology. 

1. Category I Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. Category I critical aquifer recharge areas are those areas that were identified on the city of Chehalis Wellhead Protection Map as Class A wells and include the potential for certain land use activities to adversely affect groundwater is high. Category I critical aquifer recharge areas include: 

a. Areas inside the five-year time of travel zone for Group A water system wells, calculated in accordance with the Washington State Wellhead Protection Program. 

b. Areas inside the 10-year time of travel zones in wellhead protection areas when the well draws its water from an aquifer that is at or above sea level and is overlain by permeable soils without an underlying protective impermeable layer. 

c. The city may add, reclassify or remove critical aquifer recharge areas based on additional information about areas of significant potable water supply with susceptibility to groundwater contamination or based on changes to sole source aquifers or wellhead protection areas as identified in wellhead protection programs. 

2. Category II Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas. Category II critical aquifer recharge areas are areas that provide recharge effects to aquifers that are currently or potentially will become potable water supplies and are vulnerable to contamination based on the type of land use activity. Category II critical aquifer recharge areas include: 

a. Highly Permeable Soils. The general location and characteristics of permeable soils in Lewis County is given in the Soil Survey of Lewis County by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). 

b. Areas above shallow aquifers and/or surface areas which are not separated from the underlying aquifers by an impermeable layer that provides adequate protections from contamination to the aquifer(s) below. The general location of shallow aquifers in Lewis County is based upon the professional judgment of licensed hydrogeologists with knowledge of the area. 

F. Permitted Activities. The following activities are permitted in the critical aquifer recharge area and do not require submission of a hydrogeological assessment: 

1. Construction of structures and improvements, including additions, resulting in less than five percent or 2,500 square feet (whichever is greater) total site impervious surface area and that does not result in a change of use or increase the use of a hazardous substance. 

2. Development and improvement of parks, recreation facilities, open space, or conservation areas resulting in less than five percent total site impervious surface area and do not increase the use of a hazardous substance. 

3. Existing on-site domestic septic systems releasing less than 14,500 gallons of effluent per day and that are limited to a maximum density of one system per one acre.

4. Application of household pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers that do not exceed times and rates specified on the packaging. 

5. Residential storage or use of petroleum products in amounts less than 10 gallons. 

6. Activities which have a potential for contamination below threshold amounts as defined in applicable Revised Code of Washington or local regulations. The purpose of this clause is to allow for small-scale and residential activities having no significant impacts to critical aquifer recharge areas. 

G. Prohibited Activities. The following activities and uses are prohibited in Category I critical aquifer recharge area and may be allowed with a hydrogeological assessment in Category II critical aquifer recharge area:

1. Landfills, including hazardous or dangerous waste, municipal solid waste, special waste, and wood waste; 

2. Underground Injection Wells. Wells which meet the requirements of Chapters 173-218 and 173-200 WAC, with the exception of 5B22, 5D2, 5G30, 5W12, 5W32, 5R21, 5S23; 

3. Commercial mining and washing of metals, hard rock, sand and gravel; 

4. Chemical wood preservation and/or treatment facilities; 

5. Storage, processing, or disposal of radioactive substances;

17.33.001 Legislative findings.

A. There exist districts within the city, containing business uses, but also containing residential and other uses, which were platted and built upon before the advent of current zoning and building codes.

B. Buildings and uses within such historic districts, due to the age and condition of the buildings and structures, small lot size and high degree of lot coverage, suffer from unique problems when required to adhere strictly to current zoning and building regulations.

C. It is unduly difficult to repair, remodel or improve existing buildings in the historic districts for existing uses or to establish new uses therein, whenever such actions cause the building or use to be required to meet current zoning and building regulations.

D. Variances from the requirements of current zoning and building codes are an inappropriate means of dealing with the problems of the historic districts, as such problems arise from characteristics applicable to a large number of buildings within such districts rather than from the unique characteristics of each individual property.

E. This state of affairs contributes to the continued physical deterioration of buildings, and to the loss of the ability to sustain viable business and other uses, in the historic districts.

F. Preservation and enhancement of the historic districts are deemed essential to preserve community identity and sociological integration as new development occurs in other parts of the city.

G. It is in the public interest to provide appropriate relief from the requirements of the strict application of current zoning and building codes when so doing will serve to preserve and enhance buildings and uses in the historic districts and the public health and safety are not thereby endangered. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.33.010 Historic districts created.

A. There shall be, and hereby is, created a special district to be known as an historic district (HIS). Such districts are not limited in number or size, and shall be designated and adopted consistent with the requirements of Chapter 2.66 CMC.

B. Any historic district which has been properly designated by the city shall become a new section of Appendix Chapter J and shall be regulated as provided in this chapter.

C. Any building or property which is individually listed on the State or National Registers of Historic Places, or identified in the Chehalis comprehensive plan as having local historical significance, shall be considered to be a unique HIS district, whether or not located within any other HIS district.

17.33.020 Legal boundary defined.

A. The legal boundary of any HIS district herein and hereafter created shall be as depicted in Appendix Chapter J, along with any conditions of approval or designation.

B. Each HIS district shall be subdivided into three categories of property within said district:

1. Listed, contributing property as defined in the district approval process;

2. Listed, noncontributing property as defined in the district approval process; and

C. Any property individually listed on the State or National Registers of Historic Places, or identified in the Chehalis comprehensive plan as having local historical significance, shall be considered a listed, contributing building as it relates to the administration of this chapter.

D. Each HIS district identified in Appendix Chapter J shall include a listing of all parcels of property within such district. Such listing shall include the tax parcel number, the site address, and the category of each parcel as it relates to the HIS district.

E. Any alteration, expansion or other change in the boundary of any designated historic district shall be consistent with CMC 2.66.110 through 2.66.130. Such alteration, expansion or other change which has been approved as required shall be inserted into Appendix Chapter J, replacing any prior designation of such district. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.33.030 Permitted uses.

Any use which is permitted in the underlying land use zone shall be permitted in the HIS district. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]

If a meeting with the applicant is determined to be warranted, the chairperson of the DRC shall advise the applicant of the requirement and shall schedule such a meeting at any regular DRC meeting prior to the conduct of the required public hearing on the application.

C. Subsequent to such a DRC meeting, the historic commission representative may forward a recommendation on such an application to the hearing examiner. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.33.080 Conditional uses – Unlisted property.

A. Any conditional use application relating to an unlisted property in any HIS district shall be submitted and reviewed consistent with the requirements of CMC 17.09.110 and 17.09.115.

A. The numbering sequence for avenues in the southeast and southwest quadrants shall originate at the northerly boundary of said quadrants and proceed south. The numbering sequence for streets in the southeast and southwest quadrants shall originate at Market Boulevard and proceed easterly or westerly. The numbering sequence for avenues in the northeast and northwest quadrants shall originate at the southerly boundary of said quadrants and proceed northerly. The numbering sequence for streets in the northeast and northwest quadrants shall originate at Market Boulevard or National Avenue from where it joins Market Boulevard and proceed easterly or westerly.

B. Each block or equivalent, or each approximately 300 feet in areas where there are no intersecting streets, shall be assigned one hundred numbers, equally distributed within the length of the block. Landmarks and/or geographic points should be used if appropriate to separate each centennial number set.

C. Buildings on the northerly and easterly sides of streets shall receive even numbers.

D. Buildings on the westerly and southerly sides of streets shall receive odd numbers.

E. A prorated number shall be assigned to each designated point along the centerline of any right-of-way adjoining any private property. Counting shall begin at the end of the block nearest the N/S or E/W boundary division and progress in the appropriate direction. Any line drawn perpendicular to any centerline which passes through the primary door or entrance to any building will establish the address number for such building, except in the case of a “flag lot” with limited frontage, the address number shall be assigned based on the location of the frontage, not the building entrance.

F. In case of doubt or where a question arises as to the proper address number to be assigned to any lot or building, the zoning administrator or land use administrator for the city shall designate the number of such lot or building.

G. Any building which has a separate door or entrance fronting on a street shall have a number assigned to each such door or entrance. Individual buildings which have separate tenant spaces which do not front on a street shall have one address number assigned to the building with a designator of 1, 2, 3, etc., or A, B, C, etc., assigned to each of the tenant spaces. In the case of a residential multi-building complex, the complex shall be assigned the address number, each building shall receive a letter designation, and each unit shall receive a number designation. In the case of a nonresidential multibuilding complex, each building shall be assigned an address number corresponding with the nearest public or private street, and individual tenant spaces shall be assigned either a number or a letter designation. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]


17.83.090 Buildings required to have numbers.

A. For commercial properties, addressing shall be according to the occupancy classification:

A = Assembly, B = Business, E = Educational, F = Factory, H = Hazardous, I = Institutional, M = Mercantile, R = Residential, S = Storage, U = Utility

For all newly constructed R-3 (single-family) and all new and remodeled existing I-1 occupancies, address numbers shall be installed conspicuously in contrasting color to the structure with a character height of not less than six inches high and not less than three inches wide with a stroke width of not less than three-quarters of an inch. R and I occupancies that are not visible from the public street or fire department access road on which they are addressed shall post the address numbers suitably and conspicuously at the convergence of the driveway and fire department access road serving the occupancy.

For all newly constructed occupancies except I-1, R-3, and U classified above with the primary egress immediately contiguous to the public way, e.g., public sidewalk, address numbers shall be installed conspicuously in contrasting color to the structure with a minimum character height of six inches and not less than three inches wide with a stroke width of not less than three-quarters of an inch.

For all newly constructed occupancies except I-1, R-3, and U classified above with the primary egress not immediately contiguous to the public way to a distance not greater than 500 feet from the public road frontage on which they are addressed or fire department access road, address numbers shall be installed conspicuously in contrasting color to the structure with a minimum character height of 12 inches and a width of not less than six inches with a stroke width of not less than 1.5 inches.

For all newly constructed occupancies except I-1, R-3, and U classified above that are located on a parcel greater than 500 from the public road or fire department access road on which they are addressed, address numbers shall be installed conspicuously in contrasting color to the structure with a minimum character height of 24 inches and a width of not less than 12 inches with a stroke width of not less than three inches.

B. All buildings hereafter constructed, added to, or substantially remodeled in the city shall be so numbered prior to a final inspection for occupancy. All existing buildings in the city shall be so numbered currently or within 10 days of any notice of violation.

C. If the owner of any building shall fail, refuse or neglect to post the number as required, or replace it when necessary, the fire marshal shall cause a written notice to be served on such person directing that the number be properly posted or replaced. Any such person not complying with said notice within 10 days after receipt thereof shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter. [Ord. 988B § 6, 2018; Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]

17.87.040    Premises requirements.

17.87.050    Use requirements.


17.87.001 Purpose, intent and scope.

A. Purpose. The purpose of requiring standards for adult entertainment facilities is to mitigate the adverse secondary effects caused by such facilities, to maintain compatibility with other land uses and services permitted within the city, and to promote the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

B. Intent.

1. There is convincing evidence that adult entertainment businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values; and

2. It is recognized that adult entertainment businesses, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent area; and

3. The city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight; and

4. It is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content-neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses; and

5. It is not the intent of the city council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the city council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city.

C. Scope. The standards established in this chapter apply to all adult entertainment facilities and include, but are not limited to, the following: adult arcades, adult cabarets, topless bars, adult motels, adult motion picture theaters, exotic dance studios, and adult retail stores. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]

3. Nudity which may occur within any medical facility for health-related purposes; and

4. Any changing of clothing.

B. If an adult bookstore, novelty store or video store constitutes an accessory or ancillary aspect of another permitted business occupancy, occupies less than 10 percent of the total floor area of the premises, and provides no advertising relating to the adult entertainment business anywhere, except the name of the business only on the entrance to such business location, only CMC 17.87.050 shall apply.

D. Any request for a variance from the proximity requirements above shall demonstrate, in addition to the criteria listed in CMC 17.09.120, that no other reasonable location within the city is available for the subject proposal. Such demonstration shall include a graphic depiction of the inability of the proposal to be developed without a variance. [Ord. 720B § 1, 2002.]
