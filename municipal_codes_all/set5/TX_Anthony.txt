ANTHONY - MUNICIPAL CODE 
2001 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the Town of Anthony, Texas 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 6, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Anthony, Texas Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Angel Mendoza, town clerk, and Sidney K. Gibson, town attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 6, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2016-0425 , passed May 23, 2016.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the town as accessible as possible to town officials, town employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, Town Manager, can be added between 2.04, Town Council, and Chapter 2.08, Town Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 6, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 6, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

E.	If the judge accepts the amount paid as set forth in this section, such payment shall not hereafter be refunded, and the person charged shall be relieved of any duty thereafter to appear for trial on such violation.

Chapter 9.12 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
Sections:

A.	It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations.

The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

B.	The town council finds that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and surrounding residential areas adjacent to them, causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values. Numerous studies, reports and findings concerning the harmful effects of sexually oriented businesses on surrounding land uses and neighborhoods have been produced.

Evidence through oral testimony must be presented at the administrative adjudication hearing. Evidence by affidavit under penalty of perjury may be presented by mail. 
J.	If the registered vehicle owner named in the notice of violation complies with subsections H. and I. of this section, the registered vehicle owner may not be held liable for civil school bus safety/stop arm enforcement program fines, penalties, and costs, and law enforcement officer shall send the notice of violation to the vehicle owner who held legal title to the vehicle at the time the recorded image of the violation was taken.

(Ord. 370 § 1.03, 1999) 
15.20.040 - Order of the town council. 
A.	After the public hearing before the town council of the town, if the building, structure or dwelling is found in violation of the standards set out in this chapter, the town may order that the building be vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished by the owner within the time provided for in this section. The town may also order that the occupants be relocated within a reasonable time. If the owner does not take the ordered action within the allotted time, the town shall make a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder having an interest in the building, structure or dwelling or in the property on which the building is located. The town shall send to each identified mortgagee and lienholder a notice containing: 
1.	An identification, which is not required to be a legal description, of the building and the property on which it is located; 
2.	A description of the violation of the standards that are present at the building; and 
3.	A statement that the town will vacate, secure, remove or demolish the building or relocate the occupants of the building if the ordered action is not taken within the time set out in this section. 
B.	As an alternative to the procedure prescribed above, the town may make a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder before conducting the public hearing and may give them a notice of and an opportunity to comment at the hearing. In addition, the town may file notice of the hearing in the official public records of real property in El Paso County, Texas. The notice must contain the name and address of the owner of the affected property if that information can be determined from a reasonable search of the instruments on file in the office of the county clerk, a legal description omission (see original) of the hearing. The filing of the notice is binding on subsequent grantees, lienholders, or other transferees of an interest in the property who acquire such interest after the filing of the notice, and constitutes notice of the hearing on any subsequent recipient of any interest in the property who acquires such interest after the filing of the notice. The order issued by the town may specify a reasonable time for the building to be vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished by the owner or for the occupants to be relocated by the owner and an additional reasonable time for the ordered action to be taken by any of the mortgagees or lienholders in the event the owner fails to comply with the order within the time provided for action by the owner. The town is not required to furnish any notice to a mortgagee or lienholder other than a copy of the order in the event the owner fails to timely take the ordered action. 
C.	Within ten (10) days after the date that the order is issued, the town shall:

The town shall use its best efforts to determine the identity and address of any owner, lienholder, or mortgagee of the building through the records of the El Paso County clerk and through other sources available to the town. 
E.	In conducting a hearing authorized under this section, the town shall require the owner, lienholder or mortgagee of the building to within thirty (30) days: 
1.	Secure the building from unauthorized entry; or 
2.	Repair, remove or demolish the building, unless the owner or lienholder establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be performed within thirty (30) days. 
F.	If the town allows the owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than thirty (30) days to repair, remove or demolish the building, the town shall establish specific time schedules for the commencement and performance of the work and shall require the owner, lienholder or mortgagee to secure the property in a reasonable manner from unauthorized entry while the work is being performed, as determined by the town council. 
G.	The town will not allow the owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than ninety (90) days to repair, remove or demolish the building or fully perform all work required to comply with the order unless the owner, lienholder or mortgagee: 
1.	Submits a detailed plan and time schedule for the work at the hearing; and 
2.	Establishes at the hearing that the work cannot reasonably be completed within ninety (90) days because of the scope and complexity of the work. 
H.	If the town allows the owner, lienholder or mortgagee more than ninety (90) days to complete any part of the work required to repair, remove or demolish the building, the owner, lienholder or mortgagee must regularly submit progress reports to the town to demonstrate the owner, lienholder or mortgagee has complied with the time schedules established for commencement and performance of the work. The order may require that the owner, lienholder or mortgagee appear before the town council to demonstrate compliance with the time schedules. 
I.	In a public hearing to determine whether a building complies with the standards set out in this chapter, the owner, lienholder or mortgagee has the burden of proof to demonstrate the scope of any work that may be required to comply with this chapter and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work. 
J.	If the building is not vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished, or the occupants are not relocated within the allotted time, the town may vacate, secure, remove or demolish the building or relocate the occupants at its own expense. 
K.	If the town incurs expenses under subsection J of this section, the town may assess the expenses on, and the town has a lien against, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, the property on which the building was located. The lien is extinguished if the property owner or another person having an interest in the legal title to the property reimburses the town for the expenses. The lien rises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the El Paso County clerk. The notice must contain the name and address of the owner if that information can be determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on which the building was located, the amount of expenses incurred by the town, and the balance due. 
L.	If the notice is given and the opportunity to relocate the tenants of the building or to repair, remove, or demolish the building is afforded to each mortgagee and lienholder as authorized by subsection A, B or C of this section, the lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2010-469, arts. 1-5, adopted May 25, 2010, amended ch. 15.24 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 15.24, §§ 15.24.010-15.24.160, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 284, arts. 1-5, adopted in 1987. 

Article 1. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 

15.24.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the state of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, V.T.C.A., Water Code, Section 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the town council of the town of Anthony, Texas, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2010-469, Art. 1, § A, 5-25-2010) 
15.24.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.	The flood hazard areas of the town of Anthony, Texas, are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.	These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2010-469, Art. 1, § B, 5-25-2010) 
15.24.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.	Protect human life and health; 
2.	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.	Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
6.	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
7.	Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2010-469, Art. 1, § C, 5-25-2010) 
15.24.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
1.	Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
2.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
4.	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may increase flood damage; 
5.	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2010-469, Art. 1, § D, 5-25-2010)

2.	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood elevation study" means an examination, evaluation and determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    "Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)" means an official map of a community, issued by the administrator, where the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) related erosion areas having special hazards have been designated as zones A, M, and/or E. 
    "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood insurance study (FIS)." See "flood elevation study."

b.	Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    "New construction" means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.

The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (for full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5), [of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations] presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

F.	Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 15.24.150(B) of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.	Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Section 15.24.030). 
H.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
I.	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
J.	Prerequisites for granting variances: 
1.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
2.	Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
3.	Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
K.	Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in Section 15.24.160(A)-(I) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(1)	Owners of individual lots in a single unplatted subdivision may file a joint request for approval of their respective individual residential lots. 
(2)	An application for approval of the plat of an individual lot shall be made in writing. The application shall state specifically the division, section, or subsection with which the plat does not comply and from which a waiver is being requested. The application shall contain available information and documentation which supports the requested approval. The applicant shall also provide such additional documentation as the town may request to support the application, including: 
(A)	a copy of a dated plat, sales contract, utility records, or other acceptable documentation that the subdivision occurred prior to September 1, 1989; 
(B)	the name and address of the original subdivider or the subdivider's authorized agent, if known; 
(C)	a survey and plat of the lot for which approval is requested, showing existing residences, roads, and utilities; and 
(D)	a deed, an affidavit of ownership or other evidence of ownership of the lot for which approval is requested. 
(3)	Approval of plats of individual lots shall be granted subject to the limitations of state law, and based on written findings by the town that: 
(A)	the lot for which approval is requested is within a tract that was subdivided prior to September 1, 1989, and is not owned by the original subdivider; 
(B)	a plat was required for the subdivision, but has not been filed with the county by the subdivider legally obligated to file it; 
(C)	an existing, currently occupied residential dwelling is located on the lot; 
(D)	existing water and sewer services which comply with the minimum standards set forth in this chapter are available to the lot; and 
(E)	the request is reasonable, compliance with specified sections of these rules is impractical, and a waiver is not contrary to the public health and safety. 
(e)	Final determination. 
    The town shall make the final decision on an application for a waiver. The applicant may withdraw a request for a waiver at any point in the process. If the requested waiver application is approved, the town shall issue a certificate stating that a plat of the residential lot has been reviewed and approved.

(Ord. 411 § I, 2002) 
Chapter 16.24 - APPENDIX 

Appendix A - Drainage Standards and Requirements 
    For the purpose of these regulations, drainage channels shall be classified as follows: 
a.	Primary drainage channels shall be those streams, creeks, and channels which drain an area of five hundred (500) acres or more. 
b.	Secondary drainage channels shall be all drainage channels which drain an area of less than five hundred (500) acres. 
    Methods for Calculating Stream Flow and Runoff. The maximum condition of rainfall for a fifty (50) year frequency shall be used for the purpose of determining all runoff for the sizing of drainage channels and structures, unless otherwise specified herein. The following formulas and values shall be used for calculating all stream flow and runoff for the policies and regulations established herein: 
a.	Runoff from drainage areas of nine hundred (900) acres or less shall be determined by the Rational Formula: 
Q = AIR 
    Q = Flow in cubic feet per second. 
    A = Area to be drained in acres, determined by field surveys for areas less than one hundred (100) acres, and by latest government quadrangle maps for larger area. 
    I = Percent of imperviousness of the area; may vary between seventy (70) percent and ninety-five (95) percent. Coefficients lower than these indicated values may be used; however, in such instances, individual block calculations will be submitted with plans. 
    R = Rate of rainfall over entire drainage area in inches per hour, based on time for concentration and latest government records for area. 
b.	Runoff from drainage areas greater than nine hundred (900) acres will be determined by use of accepted engineering principles. 
c.	The size of closed storm sewers, open channels, culverts, and bridges shall be determined using the Manning Formula which may be modified for use with runoff determined by the Rational Formula to: 
2/3 1/2 1.5r;em§em;A Q = _____n  
    Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second. 
    A = Cross-sectional area of water in conduit in square feet. 
    r = Hydraulic radius of water in conduit. 
    s = Mean slope of hydraulic gradient in feet of vertical rise per foot of horizontal distance. 
    n = Roughness coefficient, based on cond-ition and type of material of conduit lining, but not less than 0.013. 
    Primary Drainage Channels. All primary drainage channels lying within, or immediately adjacent to the subdivision, shall meet the following conditions: 
a.	All land having an elevation below the fifty (50) year maximum flood elevation for the final improved channel and not protected by levies or dikes shall be dedicated to the public for the purpose of providing drainage, for public park, and/or utility easement use. All dedications for public park purposes will be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. 
b.	The existing channel lying within or immediately adjacent to the subdivision shall be cleaned to provide for the free flow of water, and the channel shall be straightened, widened, and improved to the extent required to prevent overflow, resulting from a fifty (50) year frequency rainfall, beyond the limits of the dedicated drainage easement provided for in subsection (a) above. 
c.	Site improvement shall provide for the grading of all building sites and streets to an elevation where all lots, building areas, and streets will not be subject to overflow from a fifty (50) year frequency flood and in a manner that will provide for the rapid runoff of storm water. 
d.	Whenever channel improvement is carried out, sodding, back-sloping, cribbing, and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to control erosion for the anticipated conditions of flow resulting from a fifty (50) year frequency rainfall. 
e.	A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer except as provided below: 
1.	Unless a paved street surface at least two lanes wide is provided on both sides of a paved channel so as to provide access to abutting properties; 
2.	Except where lots are platted to back up to the street right-of-way where the drainage channel is located between the rear lot line and the paved street; provided, that there is no access to the rear of the lot from the street; and further provided, that at no time in the future shall access be allowed or constructed over the open drainage channel to the rear of a lot so platted. For the purpose of these regulations, a lot which sides is not considered to back up to the street right-of-way; 
3.	When a condition outlined in either subdivision (1) or (2) above is present, adequate space shall be dedicated as right-of-way to provide for maintenance of the paved drainage channel and its unpaved bank. 
f.	Culverts, bridges, and other drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications and design criteria of the town where the public shall have present or future maintenance responsibility. 
g.	Cost of construction of bridges and culverts at arterial streets and major thoroughfares will be borne by the town. The town may participate in the cost of construction of bridges and culverts at collector streets where the required hydraulic cross-section of the bridge or culvert is greater than forty (40) square feet, provided in any event that participation of the town is subject to the availability of funds. Cost to be borne by the town will be determined by the following formula: 
Total cost of bridge or culvert divided by the square feet of cross-section all multiplied by the square feet of required hydraulic cross-section less forty (40) square feet. 
    Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent owner or owners from bearing all costs if he or she or they so desire. 
h.	When the planning commission, subsequent to the submission by a developer of a preliminary plat, requires a bridge or culvert at a residential street and the required hydraulic cross-section is greater than forty (40) square feet, the town may participate in the cost of construction of the bridge or culvert in the same manner as provided for collector streets in subsection (g) above. 
    Secondary Drainage Channels and Surface Drainage. Surface drainage and all secondary channels within or adjacent to the addition shall meet the following conditions. 
a.	Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of collecting surface water from adjacent properties or intercepting and diverting side hill drainage shall be provided with an improved open channel. 
b.	Secondary drainage channels which have a primary function of transporting water through the block or collecting water from cross channels and which have a drainage area of less than forty (40) acres shall be improved with closed storm sewers; and where the secondary drainage channel has a drainage area of greater than forty (40) acres, an improved open channel or closed storm sewer may be provided. Within Green-Way developments, when the unit area to be drained is less than four acres, the town engineer may modify the requirements of the first part of this provision to permit a paved open channel, designed for use as a sidewalk, having a minimum width of four feet and provided with six inch curbs. 
c.	A drainage channel shall not be located in a street easement unless it is placed in an enclosed storm sewer except as provided below: 
1.	Unless a paved street surface at least two lanes wide is provided on both sides of a paved channel so as to provide access to abutting properties; 
2.	Except where lots are platted to back up to the street right-of-way where the drainage channel is located between the rear lot line and the paved street; provided, that there is no access to the rear of the lot from the street; and further provided, that at no time in the future shall access be allowed or constructed over the open drainage channel to the rear of a lot so platted. For the purpose of these regulations, a lot which sides is not considered to back up to the street right-of-way; 
3.	When a condition outlined in either subdivision (1) or (2) above is present, adequate space shall be dedicated as right-of-way to provide for maintenance of the paved drainage channel and its unpaved bank. 
d.	In a single-family residential high density development, site grading shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each lot will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel, sodded swale, or paved street without crossing more than four adjacent lots. 
e.	Surface water collected on streets shall be diverted to storm drains at satisfactory intervals to prevent overflow of six inch high curbs during a twenty-five (25) year frequency rain for the area and grades involved. Drainage area allowed for surface flow on streets at point of diversion shall not exceed twenty (20) acres, regardless of flow. (See Requirements Relating to Improvements). 
f.	Drainage easement of satisfactory width to provide working room for construction and maintenance shall be provided for all storm sewers. 
g.	Open channels shall be improved by providing a paved section that will carry the runoff from a rain of twenty-five (25) year frequency within the lined section and a sodded section to carry the additional runoff from a rain of fifty (50) year frequency. Whenever an open improved channel is required or authorized for a secondary drainage channel under the provisions of these regulations and the channel crosses residential lots which have been developed under the planned unit development or where the channel improve-ment is to be designed as an area that will be maintained by a property owner's association, then upon recommendation of the town engineer. The town council may modify the requirements of the first part of this subsection (g) to permit a channel improvement design in keeping with landscaping architectural plans, providing all hydraulic requirements to support the overflow resulting from a fifty (50) year frequency rainfall are met. 
    Requirements relating to improvements. 
a.	Bridges and Culverts. 
1.	All flow of water across continuous streets or alleys shall be through culverts or bridges. 
2.	Bridges and culverts shall be sized to accommodate a fifty (50) year frequency rain, without increasing the depth of flow in the channel. 
3.	Design of bridges and culverts shall conform to construction specifications of the town. 
b.	Closed Storm Sewers. Closed storm sewers shall be constructed of precast or prefabricated pipe or built in place of closed box design to conform with construction specifications of the town.

Chapter 17.04 - DISTRICTS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Sections: 

17.04.010 - Purpose. 
    The zoning regulations and districts as herein established have been made in accordance with the town's comprehensive plan for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals and the general welfare of the town. They have been designed to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewage, parks and other public requirements. They have been made with reasonable consideration, among other things, for the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view of conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the town. 
( Ord. No. 121415-507 , 12-14-2015) 
17.04.020 - Districts established. 
    Zoning districts as herein set forth are established. The town is hereby divided into ten (10) types of districts: 
A.	"A" Agricultural District: There exists in certain fringe areas of the city, land which is presently used for agricultural purposes and to which all urban services are not yet available. Those lands should continue to be used for agricultural purposes until needed for urban purposes in conformity with the orderly growth of the city. 
B.	"OS" Open Space District: The purpose of this district is to implement the goals of the town to develop and implement a system of parks and recreational opportunities throughout the community that responds to the broad variety of recreational needs of the different age groups and interests of people residing in all areas of the town. 
C.	"R" Residential District: The purpose of this district is to provide for single-family residential areas and to protect and conserve them; permitting only limited accessory and supporting uses. 
D.	"R2" Residential District Two: The purpose of this district is to provide for residential areas of a slightly higher density than that permitted in the "R" Residential District. Some accessory and supporting uses that do not conflict with the primary purpose of residential use are permitted. 
E.	"MH" Trailer Park/Mobile Home District: The purpose of this district is to provide for the development of mobile home residences that promote a residential environment and compatibility with adjoining residential districts. 
F.	"TC" Town Core District: The purpose of this district is to create a unique, attractive commercial area that has pedestrian-oriented character and contains a mix of land uses, including specialty shopping, personal services, restaurants, and office spaces. 
G.	"NC" Neighborhood Commercial District: This district is intended for retail sale of select convenient goods and services primarily for persons residing in adjacent residential areas such as retail shops, child care facilities, restaurants, and other neighborhood serving uses of a similar land use intensity and physical impact. 
H.	"C" Commercial District: The purpose of this district is to provide suitable locations for a wide variety of retail uses and other similar commercial and service activities. 
I.	"LI" Light Industrial District: The purpose of this district is to provide suitable areas for industrial and commercial uses protected against intrusion of incompatible residential uses. 
J.	"PD" Planned Development District: A PD is intended for projects that demonstrate a higher quality of site design that is more sensitive to the existing context, both built and natural, than is possible under other available zoning districts. 
    The boundaries of the districts listed above are shown on the attached zoning map. The map and all markings, notations, references and other information shown on said map are as much a part of this chapter as if said map and all notations, references and other information shown thereon were all fully set forth or described herein. The zoning map shall be kept on file at town hall. 
( Ord. No. 121415-507 , 12-14-2015) 
17.04.030 - General provisions. 
A.	The use of premises and buildings and the lot area and height of buildings in the town shall be in accordance with the minimum standards hereinafter established. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, those standards are held to be the minimum requirements for the protection of public safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
B.	Yards or lot area required for one (1) building or use cannot be used for another building or use. 
C.	The size of a lot shall not be reduced below the requirements of this chapter. 
D.	All land annexed to the town shall be accompanied by a proposal to zone the affected property to a base zoning district identified in Section 17.04.020. Such zoning district shall be appropriate for the intended final use of the property and in accordance with the comprehensive plan. 
E.	Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
a.	Where district boundaries approximately follow property lines, such property lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
b.	In unsubdivided property here district boundaries do not follow the property lines, the district boundary lines on the zoning map shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map. 
c.	Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the city council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation; and all areas included in the vacation shall then be subject to all regulations of the extended districts. 
d.	Where the streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys as shown on the zoning map, the streets or alleys on the ground shall control. 
e.	Where uncertainty exists but none of the above apply, the board of adjustment shall determine the location of the district boundary.
