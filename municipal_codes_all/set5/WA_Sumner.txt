1.18.010 Findings.

A. RCW 42.56.070(1) requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of various public records.

B. RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome.

C. The city of Sumner is comprised of numerous departments, and their divisions and subdivisions, which maintain separate databases and/or record keeping systems, which would make it extremely difficult, if not physically impossible, and would interfere with city operations, to compile an index.

D. Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems and databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records.

E. The city produces or receives an uncountable number of records each day and maintains an uncountable number of records in numerous city files.

F. The development and maintenance of a city index would be extremely costly and would provide little benefit to the public compared to the expense in maintaining the index.

G. The city’s operations do not allow for the addition, revision, or reassignment of duties of existing personnel so that an index may be developed and maintained.

H. Anticipated city revenues do not allow for additional staff for the purpose of creating and maintaining such an index.

I. Pursuant to chapter 42.56 RCW, the city of Sumner will disclose all public records, including any indexes that are maintained by the city, to the extent such records or indexes are not exempt from disclosure pursuant to chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable laws. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.020 Public records index – Order – Maintenance not required.

Pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the city council orders the following:

A. The city of Sumner is not required to maintain a current index of public records due to findings of the city council that the requirement to do so is unduly burdensome and would interfere with city operations and such a list is nearly impossible to create and/or maintain; and

B. Pursuant to chapter 42.56 RCW, the city of Sumner shall disclose all public records and any indexes of public records maintained by the city to the extent not exempt from disclosure pursuant to chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable laws. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.030 Public records disclosure – Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish the procedure for obtaining public records from the city of Sumner as required by chapter 42.56 RCW as currently enacted or hereafter amended. The city of Sumner will disclose all public records, as defined by state law, to the extent records are not exempt from disclosure pursuant to chapter 42.56 RCW or other applicable laws. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2350 § 1, 2011: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.040 Public records officer.

Information is also available at the city’s website at www.ci.sumner.wa.us. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.050 Production of public records – Generally.

A. Unless exempt from disclosure pursuant to chapter 42.56 RCW, as currently enacted or hereafter amended, or other applicable federal or state law, public records shall be available for inspection and copying. The city may make public records available on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of requested records are assembled or made ready for inspection or disclosure. Failure of the city to fully comply with any provision of this chapter shall not result in any liability imposed upon the city other than that outlined in chapter 42.56 RCW, as currently enacted or hereafter amended.

B. The city need only disclose records to the extent required by state or federal law and nothing in this policy shall be interpreted as requiring the disclosure of any record that is not subject to disclosure by state or federal law. Generally, any record, or portion thereof, which is exempt from disclosure, will not be disclosed, and information contained in the records may be removed to the extent necessary or permissible by law. The city is not required to create records or documents in response to a request for public records that do not exist at the time the request is made.

C. State law does not require the city to retain and/or maintain every public record it has ever created or used. The city of Sumner has adopted a retention schedule that has been approved by the State Records Committee.

D. The city is not required to retain records held by volunteers who (1) do not serve in an administrative capacity; (2) have not been appointed by the city to an agency board, commission, or internship; and (3) do not have a supervisory role or delegated city authority. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.060 Requests for public records.

A. In order to track and promptly respond to all requests for public records, such requests shall be made in writing and delivered in person, by fax or by mail. The city encourages requestors to send formal requests for public records by means other than email because of the risk that the email will be misdelivered or screened out and the city cannot guarantee that an email request for records will be received and processed properly. 

B. The city will provide a public records request form that may be used by those requesting public records. The public records request form is available and can be downloaded from the city’s website at www.ci.sumner.wa.us. In lieu of submitting the request for public records on the city’s form, the request may also be submitted in other written format but must contain the following information:

1. The date of the request;

2. The name of the requestor;

3. The full address of the requestor;

4. The telephone number of the requestor;

5. A complete description of the requested record;

6. The title and date of the requested record, if known;

7. The location of the requested record, if known; and

8. Whether the requestor intends to inspect the records or to obtain a copy of the records, at the cost set forth in SMC 1.18.100.

C. Requests for public records shall be submitted to the city clerk, or to a designated city employee pursuant to subsection (D) of this section. The city clerk may authorize other city employees to make the initial response pursuant to SMC 1.18.070 to a request for public records. All requests shall comply with subsections (A) and (B) of this section.

D. The following designated city employees may receive public record requests directly for the specific records identified in this subsection for each designated employee:

1. The records clerk of the police department, if the request is to inspect and/or copy a police or incident report.

2. The records clerk of the Sumner municipal court if the request is to inspect and/or copy documents within the control of the court.

If the record requested is not identified in subsections (D)(1) and (D)(2) of this section, or the requestor is unsure of where to file the request, the request shall be filed with the city clerk/public records officer. If a request for a police or municipal court document is made to the city clerk/public records officer, it will be redirected to the applicable department for processing. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2350 § 2, 2011; Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.070 Initial response to request.

A. The city shall make an initial response to the request for public records within five business days of receipt of the request. In the event a request for public records is received after 5:00 p.m., the request shall be deemed to have been received on the next business day. Depending upon the nature of the request, the city may respond initially by:

1. Producing the record after the payment of applicable fees, if any;

2. Acknowledging in writing the city’s receipt of the request accompanied by an estimate of the time necessary for further response;

3. Denying the request in writing accompanied by an explanation of the basis for the denial;

4. Acknowledging in writing that the records responsive to the request are available for inspection or copying, and that pursuant to SMC 1.18.100 a deposit is required for copies; or

5. Acknowledging that the city received the request and asking that the requestor provide clarification of a request that is unclear, accompanied by, to the greatest extent possible, a reasonable estimate of the time necessary for further response should the requestor not respond with clarification. If the requestor fails to respond to an agency request for clarification, and the entire request is unclear, the city need not respond to the request. If any portion of the request is clear, the city must respond to that/those portions.

B. In the event that the requestor completes the city’s standard public records request form, the city may return a copy of the request to the requestor with an estimation of time necessary to provide a final response to the request. This indication on the form of the estimation of time constitutes and satisfies the city’s initial response required within five days of receipt of the public disclosure request. Records provided in response to a public records request shall be those documents of record available for disclosure as of the date of the request. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.080 Final response to request.

A. A public disclosure request is not continuing in nature. In the event additional records are created after the date of the requestor’s original public records request, the requestor will need to submit a new request. Any records or portions of records disclosed by the city will be provided to the requestor in the same format as they are retained; provided, that any disclosable records contained on a computer or other electronic or mechanical device shall, at the discretion of the city, be provided in printed form, on disk, or in another format. 

B. If the requestor specifies a format in which the records should be disclosed, the city will disclose the records in the requested format if:

1. It is determined that disclosable records exist;

2. The city is capable of providing the records in the format requested; 

3. The format requested is reasonable and does not require additional staff time; and

4. The requestor pays all required fees, as specified in SMC 1.18.100. 

C. The city’s response to the request shall be deemed complete and final upon:

1. Requestor’s inspection of the records; 

2. In the event photocopies were requested, upon notification to the requestor that the photocopies requested are available for pickup and payment; or

3. In the event electronic records were requested, upon notification to the requestor that the electronic records have been emailed or otherwise transmitted to the requestor. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.090 Inspection of records.

A. In the event a requestor chooses to inspect records, the city shall notify the requestor once the records which respond to the request are available for inspection. The records will be available for inspection during customary office hours. Records that have been pulled for inspection shall be made available to the requestor for a period of no more than 30 calendar days. In the event a requestor fails to contact the city clerk or designated records clerk within 30 calendar days of being notified that the records are available for inspection: (1) the records shall be returned to the originating department; and (2) the requester will need to submit a new request for the records and the process will begin anew. If an installment response to a records request is not viewed within 30 calendar days, the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. 

B. In the event the requestor requests electronic records, the city shall email or otherwise utilize a secure file transfer site to electronically transmit the responsive records to the requestor for viewing.The electronic records will be available for a period of no more than 30 calendar days. In the event the requestor fails to contact the city clerk or designated records clerk within 30 calendar days of being notified that the electronic records have been transmitted: (1) the link to the records, if sent using the secure file transfer site, shall expire; and (2) the requestor will need to submit a new request for the records and the process will begin anew. If an installment response to a request for electronic records is not viewed or opened within 30 calendar days, the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.100 Fees.

There shall be no fee for inspecting public records or locating public documents and making them available for copying, except as follows:

A. Paper Copies. If the request exceeds 25 pages, the city may charge up to $0.15 per page. If, at the city’s discretion, materials need to be copied by an outside source either due to volume, current workload of city staff, or for any other reason, or if agency equipment must be used to fulfill the request, the requester will be charged the actual amount incurred and/or invoiced to the city in fulfilling such request.

B. Scanned Documents. The city may charge up to $0.10 per page for all requests wherein public records are scanned into an electronic format, or for the use of agency equipment to scan the records into electronic format.

C. Emailed Documents. The city may charge up to $0.05 per every four electronic files or attachments uploaded to email, cloud-based data storage services, or other means of electronic delivery, except as explicitly described in subsection (D) of this section.

D. Electronic Records. The city may charge up to $0.10 per gigabyte for the transmission of public records in an electronic format or for the use of city equipment to send the records electronically.

Requestors shall not be permitted to supply their/its own copying material for use by the city.

E. Customized Service Charge. The city may charge requestor a customized service charge if the city estimates that the request will require the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations, or provide customized electronic access services when such compilations and customized access services are not used by the city for other city purposes. The customized service charge may reimburse the agency up to the actual cost of providing the services described in this section. Before assessing a customized service charge, the city clerk or designated public records officer shall notify the requestor of the customized service charge to be applied to the request, with an explanation of why the customized service charge applies, a description of the specific expertise, and a reasonable estimate of the cost of the charge, and must provide the requestor with an opportunity to amend the request in order to avoid or reduce the cost of the customized service charge.

F. Alternative Charge. The city may charge a flat fee of up to $2.00 for any request where the city reasonably estimates and documents that the costs outlined above are clearly equal to or more than $2.00. If the city elects to charge the flat fee for an initial installment of a request produced in installments, the city shall not charge any additional fee(s) for subsequent installments on the same request.

G. Deposit Required – When. In the event that it is estimated that the copying fees applicable to a particular records request exceed $25.00, or if the request requires the use of information technology expertise to prepare data compilations or provide customized electronic access services, the city, at its discretion, may require the requestor to deposit a sum equal to 10 percent of the estimated cost prior to copying of the records. In the event the city makes a response to a request available on a partial or installment basis, the city may charge for each part of the response as it is provided to the requestor. If an installment response to a records request is not claimed or paid for within 30 calendar days, the city is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.

H. Postage and Mailing Supplies. Postage is charged at the actual postage costs of such postage, and envelopes and/or packaging are charged at the actual costs of those supplies. 

I. Accepted Payments. All payments shall be made by cash, money order, or check payable to the city of Sumner.

J. The city has the authority to waive copying fees as described in this section. If the responsive documents are pages that are eight and one-half by 14 inches or smaller, the department may provide the first 25 pages free of charge. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)


1.18.105 Denial of request for all records or bot requests.

A public records request must be for identifiable records. The city may deny a request for all or substantially all records prepared, owned, used or retained by the city not relating to a particular topic. The city may also deny automatically generated (bot) requests received from the same requestor within a 24-hour period, if the request is deemed by the city to cause excessive interference with the other essential functions of the agency. For purposes of this section, “bot” shall mean a request that the city reasonably believes was automatically generated by a computer program or script. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017)


1.18.110 Review of public records request denials.

A. Any person who objects to the initial denial or partial denial of a records request may petition in writing to the public records officer for review of that decision. The petition shall include a copy or reasonably identify the written statement by the public records officer or designee denying the request. 

B. The public records officer, in conjunction with the city administrator, will consider the petition and will either affirm or reverse the denial of the public records request.

C. Any person may obtain court review of denials of public records requests pursuant to RCW 42.56.550. (Ord. 2607 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2228 § 1 (part), 2007)

Article I. Purpose and Scope


2.100.100 Scope of policies.

This municipal code, as enacted by the Sumner city council, applies to all city employees and volunteers. In cases where these policies conflict with any city ordinance, civil service rules and regulations, the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, or state or federal law, the terms of that law or agreement prevail. In all other cases, this code applies.

The mayor and city administrator have the authority to develop and implement personnel policies and procedures that are consistent with the city’s mission and vision. The personnel policies should be updated as necessary to reflect changes in federal or state law, case law, or business practices. The mayor or city administrator may deviate from the personnel policies in individual situations, particularly in an emergency, in order to achieve the primary mission of serving the city’s citizens.

Changes to compensation and/or benefits must be adopted by ordinance and incorporated in city code as appropriate. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.110 Implementing/changing the policies and/or procedures.

The city council, by ordinance, may enact changes to the municipal code. As the need arises, the mayor or city administrator may develop, implement and/or modify personnel policies and procedures, and will notify the city council. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.120 Definitions.

“Department director” means an employee who is responsible for directing one or more departments.

“Limited duration employee” means a full- or part-time employee who is hired for a set period of time for the purpose of a specific project or initiative that lasts more than one year. Limited duration employees are considered regular full- or part-time employees for the purposes of benefits.

“Regular full-time employee” means an employee who has successfully completed a trial period as defined in these policies and who is scheduled to regularly work 40 hours a week.

“Regular part-time employee” means an employee who has successfully completed a trial period as defined in these policies and who is scheduled to regularly work less than 40 hours a week.

“Temporary or seasonal employee” means an employee who holds a job of limited duration due to special projects, seasonal work, abnormal workloads or emergencies. Employees are eligible for only those benefits, which may be limited, specifically provided for in a written union contract or by city, state or federal law or regulation. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

Article II. General Policies and Practices


2.100.200 Equal employment opportunity employer.

The city is an equal employment opportunity employer. The city employs, retains, promotes, terminates and otherwise treats all employees and job applicants on the basis of job-related qualifications and competence. These policies shall be applied without regard to any individual’s gender, race, color, religion, national origin, pregnancy, age, marital status, sensory, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation including gender expression and identity, genetic information or other basis prohibited by law. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.210 Drug-free workplace.

Based on the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act, the manufacturing, distribution, possession and use of unlawful drugs or alcohol on city premises or during work hours by city employees is strictly prohibited. Employees must notify the city within five days of any conviction for a drug violation in the workplace. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including termination. Continued poor performance or failure to successfully complete a rehabilitation program is grounds for termination. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.220 Recruiting costs.

The city may provide reimbursement for selected candidates for their expenses incurred in conjunction with their participation in the selection process for exempt, eligible management level positions. Expenses must be approved for payment before the expenses are incurred. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.230 Trial period.

Upon hire, appointment, transfer or promotion, all employees enter a trial period that is considered an integral part of the selection and evaluation process. The trial period is designed to give the employee time to learn the job and to give the supervisor time to evaluate whether the match between the employee and the job is appropriate.

A. Length of Period. The normal trial period is 12 months from the employee’s date of hire or rehire. The trial period may be reduced at time of hire, or promotion, if approved by the city administrator. If reduced, the department director may request that the trial period be extended for up to an additional six months due to circumstances such as an extended illness or a continued need to evaluate the employee’s performance.

B. Use of Leave. During their trial period, employees may use any form of paid leave.

C. End of Trial Period. The trial period is an extension of the selection process and failure to successfully complete the trial period as determined by the mayor, city administrator, or department director does not grant any right to appeal under these policies. Trial employees may be terminated with or without cause by the mayor or city administrator. In the case of unsatisfactory performance in a promotional situation, the employee may be considered for transfer back to the previous position held by the employee, if the previous position is still available.

Once the trial employee receives a satisfactory performance evaluation and the trial period is considered successfully completed, the employee is considered to have regular employment status. Successful completion of the trial period does not create an employment contract or guarantee employment with the city for a specified duration. (Ord. 2688 § 1, 2019: Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.240 Hours of work and overtime.

All city positions are designated as either “exempt” or “nonexempt” according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and Washington Minimum Wage Act regulations.

A. Reporting Time Worked. All non-exempt personnel are responsible for accurately reporting all hours worked on each day worked. Employees failing to accurately record time worked or who falsify time records are subject to discipline, up to and including termination.

B. When Eligible. Nonexempt employees are eligible for overtime for time worked beyond the employee’s scheduled shift, or as provided in a collective bargaining agreement. Paid leave (holidays, sick leave, vacation, etc.) is counted as regular time for the purposes of computing overtime.

C. Authorization. All overtime must be authorized in advance by the employee’s supervisor, although exceptions may be made for emergency situations.

D. Rate of Pay. Unless otherwise specified in a collective bargaining agreement, overtime pay is calculated at one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay for all time worked beyond the employee’s scheduled shift.

E. Exempt Employees. Exempt employees are never eligible for overtime or compensatory time, but are expected to work 40 hours or more per week. An exempt employee is paid to perform a job which may or may not necessarily be completed in a normal work week, meaning the demands of the job may require extra hours of work, attendance at night meetings or conferences, and additional supervisory duties. In recognition of the extra time demands of certain exempt positions, exempt employees are not required to strictly adhere to the normal attendance requirements as a nonexempt employee. However, if the flexible attendance interferes with department operations, or the work of the subordinates, this will be addressed as a performance issue. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.250 Compensatory time.

Nonexempt employees entitled to overtime pay may request compensatory time off instead of cash payment. This is approved on a case-by-case basis by the employee’s department head. The city is not required to grant compensatory time instead of overtime pay. Compensatory time may be accrued up to the maximum allowable under the Fair Labor Standards Act (240 hours).

Employees may use compensatory time within a reasonable time period after making a request to their department head, unless doing so would unduly disrupt city operations. Compensatory time usage should be scheduled in advance. Compensatory time must be used by the end of the calendar year. Unused compensatory time will be paid out at the applicable wage. An employee may request a three-month extension to use the compensatory time; provided, that the extension is needed due to a planned event (upcoming vacation or long-term medical leave). (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.260 Alternative work schedule and flex time.

In accordance with the Washington’s Commute Trip Reduction Law and the Washington Clean Air Act, the city has established a policy to allow for alternative work schedules and/or flex time for city employees. Flex-time schedules and compressed work or modified compressed work weeks are encouraged where and when practical. The mayor and city administrator are authorized to develop a policy relating to alternative scheduling approval. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.270 Actions subject to disciplinary action.

The policy of the city of Sumner shall be to administer disciplinary action in a constructive and/or progressive manner so as to respond to or effectively correct unacceptable behavior. This allows employees, when appropriate, the opportunity to recognize and change their behaviors at the earliest possible time.

Unless modified in an employment agreement or other contract, or with regard to employees serving trial period, it is the policy of the city to take disciplinary action only when there is “just cause” for such action and further to ensure that all employees are granted their “due process” rights. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.280 Layoff.

The mayor or city administrator may lay off employees for lack of work, budgetary restrictions, reorganization or other changes that have taken place.

In determining who is to be laid off, the city administrator and/or mayor reserves the right, within the budget parameters set by the council, to determine the layoffs in a way which provides the best mix of skills and experience as needed to provide services to the citizens of Sumner. Employees who are laid off may be eligible to be re-employed, if a vacancy occurs in a position for which they are qualified within a one-year period. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.290 Benefits for part-time, temporary employees and seasonal workers.

Unless noted otherwise in these policies, benefits for regular part-time and temporary employees are as follows:

A. Regular Part-Time Employees.

1. Accrued Leave/Paid Holidays. Regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours per week shall receive prorated accrued paid leave (vacation, bereavement) and paid holidays. All part-time employees are eligible for prorated sick leave accrual. “Prorated” means the ratio between the number of hours in the employee’s normal work schedule and 40 hours per week.

2. Medical Insurance. Part-time employees working at least 20 hours per week, but less than 30 hours per week, may choose to receive prorated medical benefits. Part-time employees working on average 30 or more hours per week shall receive medical benefits at a prorated amount unless waived by the employee.

B. Temporary and Seasonal Employees.

1. Accrued Leave/Paid Holidays. Temporary and seasonal employees are eligible for prorated sick leave accrual. “Prorated” means the ratio between the number of hours in the employee’s normal work schedule and 40 hours per week. Temporary employees are not eligible for other accrued leave or paid time off (e.g., holidays or bereavement) unless otherwise allowed by the mayor, city administrator or collective bargaining agreement.

2. Medical Insurance. Temporary and seasonal employees who work more than 30 hours per week shall receive medical benefits the first day of the third month; provided, that their expected length of service is more than 90 days. The medical benefits shall be prorated if the temporary employee works less than 40 hours but more than 30 hours per week. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

Article III. Compensation


2.100.300 Salary classification and grades.

It is the responsibility of the city council to establish through approval of the annual budget the salary ranges for all classifications in the city of Sumner. Each job title within the city is classified into one of the city’s classifications for salary purposes. Each classification is designated a particular salary or salary range shown on the city’s salary and wage schedule, which is approved annually by the city council.

The mayor or city administrator may propose, and the city council may grant, an across-the-board pay adjustment (cost-of-living increase) from time to time, raising the salaries of all positions by a specified amount within a classification(s). Such adjustments, if any, will not change an employee’s pay increase anniversary date. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.310 Employee pay rates.

Employees shall be paid within the limits of the wage range to which their positions are assigned. Usually, new employees will start their employment at the minimum wage rate for their classification. However, a new employee may be employed at a higher rate than the minimum when the employee’s experience, training or proven capability warrant, or when prevailing market conditions require a starting rate greater than the minimum. Only the mayor or city administrator has the authority to employ a person at a rate higher than the salary range step 1, with any step higher than 3 being approved by the city council.

Step increases are contingent on satisfactory performance. If an employee’s performance is consistently unsatisfactory, the department director may defer a scheduled pay increase for a stipulated period of time or until the employee’s job performance is satisfactory.

Any employee promoted to a position in a higher classification and salary range should typically receive the next highest available pay step in the new range. If the new step is less than three percent higher, the mayor or city administrator may approve the next highest step.

Temporary and seasonal workers’ pay shall not exceed the amount set by the city council. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.320 Paydays.

Employees will normally be paid on the fifth and twentieth of each month. If the regular payday occurs on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, employees will be paid on the last working day before the regular payday. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.330 Deductions.

Some regular deductions from the employee’s earnings are required by law; other deductions are allowed by law and specifically authorized by the employee. The city will withhold from the employee’s paycheck those deductions required by law and any voluntary deductions authorized by the employee, by applicable collective bargaining agreement, when allowed by statute. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

The benefits, terms, and conditions of the employer’s health benefits plan, including costs owed by eligible employees (if any), are determined by city council and/or applicable collective bargaining agreements. If there are conflicts between this policy, the plan, and any collective bargaining agreements, the document satisfying the minimum protections of the PPACA shall apply. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.410 Healthcare eligibility.

2.100.440 Continuation of health insurance coverage.

A. Workers’ Compensation Leave. An employee receiving workers’ compensation benefits continues to accrue vacation leave and sick leave for up to six months as long as they are in a paid status. The city also continues to pay for the employer’s portion of health insurance premiums (unless otherwise provided by the employee’s collective bargaining agreement); provided, that the employee continues to pay their share of premiums, if any. After six months, the employee’s benefits shall cease unless the mayor or city administrator makes an exception based on the established criteria. The employee may continue health care benefits through COBRA.

B. COBRA Benefits. Upon an employee’s separation from service the employee may be eligible to continue city health insurance benefits, at the employee’s expense, to the extent provided under the federal COBRA regulations. An administrative handling fee over and above the cost of the insurance premium may be charged to the employee or his/her dependents who elect to exercise their COBRA benefits.

C. Termination, Retirement, Leave of Absence. The city pays for healthcare one month in advance. For eligible employees who terminate, retire or are on an approved leave of absence, the city will pay the premium for the month after the employee separates, provided the employee is on paid status for 80 hours of the month that they are leaving. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

2.100.510 Disability benefits (workers’ compensation).

All employees are covered by the State Workers’ Compensation Program. This insurance covers employees in case of on-the-job injuries or job-related illnesses. For qualifying cases, state industrial insurance will pay the employee for workdays lost and medical costs due to job-related injuries or illnesses. All job-related injuries or accidents shall be reported immediately to the supervisor.

The city may require an examination at its expense, performed by a physician of its choice, to determine when the employee can return to work and if he/she will be capable of performing the duties of the position. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

2.100.560 Tuition reimbursement.

The city seeks to provide educational opportunity and incentive to regular full-time employees who have successfully completed their trial period.

2.100.570 Commute trip reduction benefits.

In accordance with Washington’s Commute Trip Reduction Law and the Washington Clean Air Act, employees who utilize mass transit to commute to and from work shall be entitled to a 50 percent monthly reimbursement of transit fares.

2.100.605 Accrued leave for part-time, temporary or seasonal employees.

This section does not apply to accrued sick leave. See SMC 2.100.620.

Regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours per week shall receive prorated accrued leave. “Prorated” means the ratio between the number of hours in the employee’s normal work schedule and 40 hours per week. Nonaccrued leave, e.g., bereavement, FMLA, military leave, etc., shall be prorated at the same rate as accrued leave on a per use basis.

Temporary employees are not eligible for accrued or other paid leave unless otherwise allowed by the mayor, city administrator or collective bargaining agreement.

Seasonal workers are not eligible to receive paid leave unless enumerated in a collective bargaining agreement. (Ord. 2614 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.610 Vacation leave. 

A. Accrual. Each regular full-time employee is entitled to vacation leave as follows:

	Years of Service	Vacation Days (Hours)

	< 1	12 (96)

	1 – 2	13 (104)

	2 – 3	14 (112)

	3 – 4	15 (120)

All new employees shall accrue vacation leave from the date of employment. Regular part-time employees will receive vacation leave on a pro rata basis. Temporary employees and seasonal workers are not eligible for any vacation leave benefits unless otherwise provided by the mayor, city administrator or a collective bargaining agreement. The mayor or city administrator, as a condition of appointment, may start a new employee at an accrual rate of one to six years without council approval. Starting an employee higher than six years requires council approval.

Employees who are in an unpaid status for the entire pay period do not accrue vacation benefits. Employees who are in any form of a paid status during the pay period are eligible for accruals.

B. Accrual Limits. Total vacation accrual must be at or below 368 hours by the end of the calendar year. Unused vacation time will be forfeited to the city. An employee may request a three-month extension to use the vacation time; provided, that the extension is needed due to a planned event, e.g., upcoming vacation, long-term medical leave or retirement. Employees may accrue more than the annual limit; however, by December 31st the leave accrual must be at 368.

C. Cash Out. Employees will be paid for unused vacation time upon termination of employment at the rate of 100 percent.

The mayor may authorize, as funds are available, the cash out of accrued vacation hours in excess of the 368-hour limit. The intent of the cash out is to minimize the unfunded liability by cashing out vacation at a lower hourly rate than it would likely be paid out in the future. (Ord. 2663 § 1, 2018: Ord. 2614 § 1 (part), 2017; Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.620 Sick leave.

A. Accrual. Each regular full-time employee shall receive eight hours of sick leave per month. All part-time or temporary employees shall receive prorated accruals, based on their number of scheduled regular hours. “Prorated” means the ratio between the number of hours in the employee’s normal work schedule and 40 hours per week.

Regular employees who are in an unpaid status for the entire pay period do not accrue sick leave benefits. Regular employees who are in any form of a paid status during the pay period are eligible for accruals. Temporary employees who are in an unpaid status at any time during the period shall receive prorated sick leave accruals based on the number of hours worked in the period.

B. Separation. Upon separation of employment all regular full-time and regular part-time employees shall be paid one of the following percentages on unused sick leave up to a maximum of 720 hours:

	Retirement	100% for first 360 hours, 25% for up to an additional 360 hours

	Disability retirement	100%

Temporary full-time or part-time employees are not entitled to any sick leave pay out upon separation. For the purposes of this section “retirement” shall mean when an employee separates employment with the intent to retire and at the time of separation the employee is age eligible to retire from the state retirement plan that they are enrolled/contributing to.

Employees who return to work within one year are entitled to restoration of their sick bank, less the amount paid out upon separation.

Employees who use all their accumulated sick leave and require more time off from work due to illness or injury may be eligible for state or federal protected leave or leave without pay. (See protected leave policy, SMC 2.100.625, and leave without pay policy, SMC 2.100.640.) (Ord. 2653 § 1, 2018; Ord. 2614 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

Eligibility for leave and benefits, which begins January 1, 2020, is established by Washington law. Premiums for benefits are established by law and for the period ending December 31, 2020, will total four-tenths of one percent of employees’ wages (unless otherwise limited by action of the state). Employees will pay through payroll deduction the full costs of the premiums associated with family leave benefits and 45 percent of the cost of the premiums associated with the medical leave benefits, as determined under RCW 50A.04.115. The city will pay the remaining premium amounts.

C. Protected Leave Use. Employees may choose to use any applicable protected leave, e.g., FMLA, WFLA, etc., consecutive to accrued leave; provided, that after the employee uses 960 hours of sick leave, and has exhausted other available accrued leaves (vacation, compensatory or holiday time), protected leave shall run concurrent with any remaining sick leave balance.

The city recognizes that certain FLSA-exempt positions are required to work substantially in excess of the standard work schedule for the city on an ongoing, regular basis. The mayor or the city administrator has the authority to authorize additional management leave for these positions. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.640 Leave without pay.

The mayor or city administrator is authorized to develop and implement a shared leave policy to allow employees to donate leave to another employee. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.650 Jury and witness leave.

Employees who are called to serve on a jury or appear as a subpoenaed witness in any established court shall be released from work to do so. During the period of such absence, the employee on jury duty will receive full salary. An employee who is a subpoenaed witness will receive full salary upon proof that the testimony given was on behalf of the city. However, any expense payments for jury service received by the employee must be endorsed or paid to the city. Employees who are absent from work for these purposes will retain seniority and all benefits.

The time away will not affect vacation or sick leave accruals. Employees who appear in court as the plaintiff or defendant in any action, wherein the city is not a party, shall not be paid for the time away from work unless that time is accrued vacation leave. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)


2.100.660 Administrative leave.

Administrative leave with or without pay may be used in the best interests of the city as determined by the mayor or city administrator during the pendency of an investigation or other administrative proceeding. (Ord. 2595 § 1 (part), 2017)

The number of installments shall be less by two than the number of years which the bonds issued to pay for the improvement are to run. Interest on the whole amount unpaid at the rate fixed by the ordinance shall be due on the due date of the first installment of principal and each year thereafter on the due date of each installment of principal. The first installment shall become due and payable during the 30-day period succeeding a date one year after the date of first publication of the city treasurer’s notice, and annually thereafter each succeeding installment shall become due and payable in like manner. If the whole or any portion of any assessment remain unpaid after the first 30-day period herein provided for, interest upon the whole unpaid sum shall be charged at the rate fixed in the ordinance providing for such improvement and each year thereafter one of said installments, together with interest due upon the whole of the unpaid balance shall be collected. Any installment not paid prior to the expiration of the 30-day period during which such installment is due and payable, shall thereupon become delinquent. All delinquent installments shall be subject to a charge for interest at the bond rate and to an additional charge of five percent penalty levied upon both principal and interest due on such installment or installments.

A. Assessment Roll – Filing – Hearing, Date, by Whom Held. The assessment roll for local improvements, when prepared as provided by law, shall be filed with the city clerk. The city council shall thereupon fix a date for a hearing thereon before the council; may direct that the hearing shall be held before a committee thereof; or the city council may designate an officer to conduct such hearings. The committee or officer designated by council shall hold a hearing on the assessment roll and consider all objections filed. Following said hearing, the committee or officer shall make recommendations to the city council. The city council shall thereafter either adopt or reject the recommendations of the committee or officer. If a hearing is held before such a committee or officer it shall not be necessary to hold a hearing on the assessment roll before the city council. An owner of property, having filed a protest before or at the hearing, may appeal his or her assessment to the city council from a decision made by a committee or officer. The same procedure may, if so directed by the city council, be followed with respect to any assessment upon the roll which is raised or changed to include omitted property. The city council shall direct the city clerk to give notice of any such hearings, in the manner required by law.

B. Hearings on Assessment Roll.

1. The city council, the committee thereof, the hearing examiner or officer designated by the city council shall commence the hearing on the date and at the time and place fixed by the city council, but may in the exercise of discretion recess the hearing to times certain in order to allow the parties to obtain essential additional information; provided, however, that an effort shall be made at all times to avoid delays which unnecessarily allow interest to accumulate upon obligations for which the local improvement district is responsible.

2. The committee, hearing examiner or officer shall reduce his/her findings, recommendations and decisions to writing and shall file them with the city clerk within 20 days following the conclusion of the hearing. Notice of the filing, together with copies of the findings, recommendations and decisions, shall be mailed by the city clerk (or any person designated by the city clerk to do so under his/her supervision) within three business days of the filing to all persons who filed timely written objections to confirmation of the assessment roll as prepared. Any persons desiring to file an appeal to the city council shall be required to follow the procedure outlined herein.

C. Council Appeals.

1. Any finding, recommendation or decision of a committee, hearing examiner, or officer designated by the city council to conduct a hearing pursuant to RCW 35.44.070 and 35.44.080 shall be subject to appeal to the city council.

2. An appeal under this section may be filed only by a party who timely perfected a protest at the initial hearing. The notice of appeal shall, in addition to requirements as to content specified elsewhere in this chapter, state clearly on the cover or cover page the number of the local improvement district and the appellant’s name and parcel number and shall be filed with the city clerk no later than the fourteenth day after the day upon which the report and recommendation of the committee, hearing examiner or other officer are filed with the city clerk.

3. The notice of appeal shall also include a concise statement of the basis therefor and, in the event that appellant deems the references on the findings, recommendations and decisions inadequate, a reference by metered index numbers to the places in the electronically prepared record of the hearing where the pertinent material may be found. The notice of appeal shall also designate by name or title and by sub-number the items or exhibits in the record to which reference will be made in argument or briefing before the city council.

4. Upon the filing of a notice of appeal the city clerk shall promptly notify the city attorney and furnish a copy of the notice to the city council and the concerned city departments. Within 15 days following the filing of a notice of appeal the city council shall set a time and place for a hearing on the appeal before the city council and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed notice of the time and place to the appellant, provided the time shall be as soon as practicable in order to avoid accumulation of additional interest on the obligations of the local improvement district. The city council shall direct whether the appeals are to be considered with or without oral argument.

5. Review by the city council on appeal shall be limited to and shall be based solely upon the record from the hearing below; provided, however, that the city council may permit oral or additional written arguments or comments when confined to the content of the record of the hearing below. The recommendation appealed from shall be accorded substantial weight and the burden of establishing the contrary shall be upon the appealing party. In respect to the matter appealed the city council may adopt or reject, in whole or in part, the findings, recommendations and decisions of the committee, hearing examiner or officer or make such other disposition of the matter as is authorized by RCW 35.44.100 and this chapter.

The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted as an official control to implement Sumner’s comprehensive plan policies, the Growth Management Act, chapter 36.70A RCW, RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100; and the State Subdivision Act, chapter 58.17 RCW. This chapter is also necessary to address identified impacts of new development on schools, in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 2661 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2018: Ord. 2420 § 1 (part), 2012)


3.50.010 Findings – Authority and studies.

The city council finds and determines that new growth and development in the city, including but not limited to new residential, commercial, retail, and office development, will create increased demand on public facilities including parks, open space and recreational facilities, streets and roads, and public schools, and further finds that growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of such planned facilities needed to serve that growth and development activity. The Sumner-Bonney Lake and Dieringer school districts have requested that the city impose school impact fees on the districts’ behalf and each has prepared a capital facilities plan documenting the impact of new development within the Sumner-Bonney Lake and Dieringer school districts on school district facilities. The city council accepts the methodology and data contained in the capital facilities plan. Therefore, pursuant to chapter 82.02 RCW, the city council adopts this chapter to assess impact fees for public schools within the Sumner-Bonney Lake and Dieringer school districts.

The city expressly reserves the right to conduct and rely on future studies and reports referenced by the city council to make future adjustments to impact fees. It is the desire of the city of Sumner to have new development assessed impact fees in an orderly and uniform manner and will endeavor to have common formulas and administrative processes for the levying of these fees. Therefore, pursuant to chapter 82.02 RCW, the city council adopts this chapter to assess school impact fees. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purpose of establishing the city of Sumner impact fee program. (Ord. 2718 § 1, 2019: Ord. 2661 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2018: Ord. 2420 § 1 (part), 2012)

If the accepted credit value is less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as an impact fee. In the event the amount of the credit is calculated to be greater than the amount of the impact fee due, the development applicant may apply such excess credit toward impact fees imposed on similar capital facilities for other developments within the same service area. Such credits are not transferable between applicants or service areas.

E. In cases where a developer requests an independent fee calculation, adjustment exception or a credit pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(3), the city shall consult with the district and the district shall advise the city prior to the city making the final impact fee determination.

No appeals shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at issue have been paid and no appeal may be filed after the building permit has been issued.

B. The fee payer must first file a request for review regarding impact fees with the school district as follows:

1. The request shall be in writing;

2. The request for review by the district shall be filed within 21 calendar days of the fee payer’s payment of the impact fees at issue. The failure to timely file such a request shall constitute a final bar to later seek such review; and

a. Affirm the school district’s decision; or

b. Reverse or modify the school district’s decision.

3.50.140 Impact fee accounts and refunds.

A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the district solely for the district’s school impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the district, based in part on its report prepared pursuant to SMC 3.50.050, shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. The district shall submit a copy of this report to the city council. The city shall maintain separate school impact fee and administration fee accounts pursuant to SMC 3.50.100, and shall prepare a report on the source and amount of all school impact fees collected and transferred to the district.

B. Impact fees for the district’s system improvements shall be expended by the district only in conformance with the capital facilities plan element of the comprehensive plan.

C. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the district for a permissible use within six years of receipt by the district, unless an extraordinary or compelling reason exists for fees to be held longer than six years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified to the city by the district in a written report. The city council shall identify the district’s extraordinary and compelling reasons for the fees to be held longer than six years in the council’s own written findings.

D. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within six years of receipt of the funds by the district on school facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The district shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records.

E. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the district in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the district in conformance with the capital facilities plan within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.

F. Should the city seek to terminate any or all school impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a school impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the district, but must be expended by the district, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

G. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:

1. The developer does not proceed to finalize the development activity as required by statute or city code including the Uniform Building Code; and

2. No impact on the district has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the district has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the district has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three years the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the district and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The district shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in this section.

H. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the district on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 2661 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2018: Ord. 2420 § 1 (part), 2012)


3.50.150 Existing authority unimpaired.

Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the fee payer or the proponent of a development activity to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the underlying development approval process; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent with the provisions of RCW 82.02.050(1)(c). (Ord. 2661 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2018: Ord. 2420 § 1 (part), 2012)

(Ord. 2678 § 1 (part), 2019)


3.52.110 Annual compliance review.

A. Within 30 calendar days after the first anniversary of the date of filing the final certificate of tax exemption and each year for the tax exemption period, the property owner shall be required to file a notarized declaration with the director indicating the following:

1. A statement of occupancy and vacancy of the multifamily units during the previous 12 months;

C. City staff may also conduct on-site verification of the declaration. Failure to submit the annual declaration shall result in a review of the exemption per RCW 84.14.110. (Ord. 2678 § 1 (part), 2019)


3.52.120 Cancellation of tax exemption.

If the director determines the owner is not complying with the terms of the contract or this chapter, the tax exemption shall be canceled. This cancellation may occur in conjunction with the annual review or at any other time when noncompliance has been determined. If the owner intends to convert the multifamily housing to another use, the owner shall notify the director and the Pierce County assessor in writing within 60 calendar days of the change in use.

A. Effect of Cancellation. If a tax exemption is canceled due to a change in use or other noncompliance, the following taxes and penalties will apply:

1. Additional real property tax, plus interest, shall be imposed based upon the value of the nonqualifying improvements. This additional tax is calculated based upon the difference between the property tax paid and the property tax that would have been paid if it had included the value of the nonqualifying improvements dated back to the date that the improvements were converted to a nonqualifying use.

2. A penalty shall be imposed amounting to 20 percent of the value of the additional property tax plus interest.

3. The interest is calculated at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes from the dates on which the additional property tax could have been paid without penalty if the improvements had been assessed at full value without regard to this tax exemption program.

4. The additional taxes, interest and penalties will become a lien on the land and attach at the time the property or portion of the property is removed from multifamily use or the amenities no longer meet applicable requirements. The lien has priority over and must be fully paid and satisfied before a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.

B. Notice of Cancellation. Pursuant to RCW 84.14.110(2), upon determining that a tax exemption is to be canceled, the director shall notify the owner by mail, return receipt requested.

C. Appeal. The property owner may appeal the determination of cancellation of the tax exemption to the hearing examiner pursuant to chapter 18.56 SMC by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 30 calendar days, specifying the factual and legal basis for the appeal. The hearing examiner will conduct a hearing under chapter 18.56 SMC for a Process I action.

Furthermore, issuance of a license pursuant to this chapter does not constitute the creation of a duty by the city to indemnify the licensee for any wrongful acts against the public, or to guarantee the quality of goods, services or expertise of a licensee. The issuance of a license does not shift responsibility from the licensee to the city for proper training, conduct or equipment of the licensee or their agents, employees or representatives, even if specific regulations require standards of training, conduct or inspection. (Ord. 2225 § 1 (part), 2007)

1. The written finding must be based upon:

a. The written complaint of a citizen who is willing to testify that the dog has acted in a manner which causes it to fall within the definition of SMC 6.04.020(U); or

b. Dog bite reports filed with the Metro; or

c. Actions of the dog witnessed by any animal control officer or law enforcement officer; or

d. Other substantial evidence. 

2. Exclusions. A dog may not be declared potentially dangerous if Metro determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the threat, injury, or bite alleged to have been committed by the dog was sustained by a person who was at the time committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog, or who was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the animal, or who has been in the past observed or reported to have tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog, or who was committing or attempting to commit a crime. 

B. Notice to Declare. If any animal control officer determines there is probable cause to declare a dog potentially dangerous, Metro must provide the dog owner with notice that the dog will be declared potentially dangerous. Fifteen days after the notice is served, unless such notice is otherwise rescinded by Metro or the director, the dog will be deemed potentially dangerous pursuant to this chapter.

1. Contents of Notice. The notice shall be in writing and shall state the statutory basis for the declaration, the reasons Metro considers the dog potentially dangerous, a statement that the dog is subject to permitting and other restrictions required by this chapter, including a recitation of the restrictions and requirements in SMC 6.10.040 (permitting), 6.10.080 (confinement), and 6.10.090 (notification), an explanation of the owner’s rights, the proper procedure for appealing the declaration, and the opportunity to meet with the director and give reasons or information as to why the dog should not be declared potentially dangerous.

3. Meeting. If, within 15 days after service of the notice, the owner requests a meeting with the director, the director shall notify the owner of the date, time, and location for such meeting. During such meeting, the director will determine whether the owner has established good cause for the notice to be rescinded and will orally inform the owner of his or her decision at such time. Following the meeting, the director shall serve the owner with a written letter explaining the director’s decision. If the director rescinds the notice, the dog will not be deemed potentially dangerous and no further action is required by the owner.

B. On appeal before the municipal court, the burden shall be on the city to prove the declaration of potentially dangerous dog, as defined in SMC 6.04.020(U), is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The municipal court shall set a hearing on the appeal with notice to all parties of the date, time, and location of the hearing. 

C. The hearing before the municipal court is not subject to the evidentiary rules of the court system, but shall be guided by the concept of due process. Evidence, including hearsay evidence, is admissible if in the judgment of the court it is the kind of evidence upon which reasonably prudent persons are accustomed to rely upon in the conduct of their affairs. The court may exclude evidence that is irrelevant, unreliable, immaterial, or unduly repetitious. 

D. The municipal court shall have the authority to make the following determination on appeal:

1. Rescind the declaration of potentially dangerous dog;

2. Uphold the declaration of potentially dangerous dog; or

3. Condition the declaration of potentially dangerous dog for a period not to exceed 12 months, at which time the municipal court shall conduct a review hearing to determine if sufficient evidence supports maintaining the declaration of potentially dangerous dog. During any period of conditional declaration, the owner shall obtain a potentially dangerous dog permit and comply with all provisions set forth in SMC 6.10.040 (permitting), 6.10.080 (confinement), and 6.10.090 (notification). The owner is responsible for requesting a review hearing at the end of the conditional declaration period.

F. While any appeal is pending, the provisions of SMC 6.10.080 and 6.10.090 shall apply. (Ord. 2676 § 1 (part), 2019)


6.10.040 Permits for potentially dangerous dogs.

A. It is unlawful for an owner to have a potentially dangerous dog in the city without a current permit issued under this section.

B. Permit Submittals. Metro may issue a permit to the owner of a potentially dangerous dog if the owner completes the following: 

1. Provides payment of the permit fee;

2. Provides proof that the dog has been microchipped (and microchip number is provided);

6.10.050 Declaring dog as dangerous.

A. Metro may find and declare a dog dangerous if any animal control officer has probable cause to believe that the dog falls within the definitions set forth in SMC 6.04.020(V) and the exclusions contained in this section do not apply. The written finding must be based upon:

1. The written complaint of a citizen who is willing to testify that the animal has acted in a manner which causes it to fall within the definition of SMC 6.04.020(V); or

2. Dog bite reports filed with Metro; or

3. Actions of the dog witnessed by any animal control officer or law enforcement officer; or

4. Other substantial evidence.

B. Exclusions. A dog shall not be declared dangerous if Metro determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the threat, injury, or bite alleged to have been committed by the dog was sustained by a person who was at the time committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog, or who was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog, or who has been in the past observed or reported to have tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog, or who was committing or attempting to commit a crime.

C. Notice to Declare. If any animal control officer determines there is probable cause to declare a dog dangerous, Metro must provide the dog owner with notice that the dog will be declared dangerous. Fifteen days after the notice is served, unless such notice is otherwise rescinded by Metro or the director, the dog will be deemed dangerous pursuant to this chapter. 

1. Contents of Notice. The notice shall be in writing and shall state the statutory basis for the declaration, the reasons Metro considers the dog dangerous, a statement that the dog is subject to permitting and other restrictions required by this chapter, including a recitation of the restrictions in SMC 6.10.070 (permitting), 6.10.080 (confinement), and 6.10.090 (notification), an explanation of the owner’s rights, the proper procedure for appealing the declaration, and the opportunity to meet with the director and give reasons or information as to why the dog should not be declared dangerous. The meeting must be requested by the owner and must take place within 15 days of service of the notice. The director has authority to extend the 15-day deadline for the meeting under extenuating circumstances. 

2. Restrictions. Upon service of the notice, the dog shall at all times be confined pursuant to SMC 6.10.080. Furthermore, the owner must comply with all requirements set forth in SMC 6.10.090.

3. Meeting. If, within 15 days after service of the notice, the owner requests a meeting with the director, the director shall notify the owner of the date, time, and location for such meeting. During such meeting, the director will determine whether the owner has established good cause for the notice to be rescinded or amended from dangerous to potentially dangerous, and will orally inform the owner of its decision at such time. Following the meeting, the director shall serve the owner with a written letter explaining the director’s decision. If the director rescinds the notice, the dog will not be deemed dangerous and no further action is required by the owner. If the director amends the notice to declare from dangerous to potentially dangerous, the same appeal period applies as if the notice to declare had not been amended. 

4. Effect of Notice. On the sixteenth day following service of the notice to declare, unless said notice is rescinded or amended by Metro or the director, the dog shall be deemed dangerous. (Ord. 2676 § 1 (part), 2019)

D. The municipal court shall have the authority to make the following determination on appeal:

1. Rescind the declaration of dangerous dog;

A vacancy shall not be considered unless the dog has been in compliance and has no violations of the restrictions and permitting requirements imposed as a result of the declaration for a minimum of three years. Metro may vacate the declaration if it determines that the declaration is no longer appropriate as a result of a change in the dog’s behavior due to age, health, training, and/or other factors. It is the owner’s burden to provide information to Metro in support of vacating the declaration. There shall be no appeal from Metro’s decision in response to a request to vacate a declaration.

8.04.010 Purpose – Amendments.

A. The rules and regulations contained in this chapter are made only for the benefit of the lot owners and are designed to limit their rights insofar as such limitations are for the benefit of all. If rules and regulations are not made, the exercise by certain ones of what would seem to be their proper rights would interfere with the rights and enjoyment of others, as well as destroy the general scheme of beauty of the property. No rule has been adopted except as was found obligatory to preserve the rights of all for whom the city considers itself the trustee.

B. This chapter may be changed or amended without notice at any time by the city council, and will be so changed and amended when any rule is found to be detrimental to the best interests of the lot owners as a whole or when new conditions require the adoption of other or further regulations. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 2, 1928. Prior code § 10.02.020)


8.04.020 Waiver of rules.

The city council shall have the right to make exceptions from this chapter when deemed advisable for the best interests of the property; such exceptions shall not be considered as rescinding or waiving any of these rules. Any waiver that may be made by the city council shall not be or be considered to be a continuing waiver and shall not bar the city or city council from enforcing the usual rules and regulations at any later time it may be desired so to do. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 25 (part), 1928. Prior code § 10.02.300)


8.04.030 Lots – Plat and survey.

Repealed by Ord. 2511. (Ord. 378 § 4 (part), 1928. Prior code § 10.02.040)


8.04.040 Lots – Grade.

The grade of all lots is established when the ground is surveyed and no change by the lot owner will be allowed. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 4 (part), 1928. Prior code § 10.02.050)


8.04.050 Lots – Tax-exempt – Sale for debt.

All lots in the Sumner cemetery will be sold with an additional charge for the development fund and endowment care and are conveyed by deed for burial purposes only. They are exempt from taxation and cannot be sold for debt or mortgage. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 948 § 2, 1972: Ord. 378 § 4 (part), 1928. Prior code § 10.02.060)


8.04.060 Lots – Conveyance.

All lots in the Sumner cemetery are conveyed to the purchaser by warranty deed when paid in full, but the rights of the purchaser therein are subject to such rules and regulations as are to be made from time to time by the city council. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 1, 1928. Prior code § 10.02.010)


8.04.070 Lots – Transfer.

A. All lot transfers, including the initial and any subsequent transfers, must be executed by deed pursuant to the conditions of and on forms obtainable at the cemetery office.

B. The record of deed kept by the city of Sumner is the only evidence of title recognized by the city which is to govern and control all interments therein. The possession of a deed is not sufficient evidence of the transfer of a lot from the original purchaser, and no sale, transfer or conveyance of any lot or interest therein shall be valid without the consent in writing of the cemetery administrative manager upon such transfer or conveyance.

C. The charge for such a transfer and its recording will be as listed in the fee schedule; provided, that the city will not consent to any transfer of nor recognize for purposes of interment any lots or graves upon which there has not been full payment. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 4 (part), 1928. Prior code § 10.02.070)


8.04.080 Lots – Common ownership.

A. A lot may be held in common ownership, but in such cases only one monument will be permitted on the entire lot.

8.04.090 Endowment care.

A. No lots or graves will be sold in the Sumner cemetery without endowment care. “Endowment care” includes the upkeep of driveways and walks and other improvements belonging to the cemetery, mowing the grass at reasonable intervals, pruning shrubs and trees and such work as shall be necessary.

B. The city does not bind itself to maintain, repair or replace any grave markers or monumental structures erected upon the lot. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 3, 1928. Prior code § 10.02.030)


8.04.100 Records of ownership.

In case of the death of a lot owner the city will recognize the rights of the surviving wife or husband and next of kin, insofar as it is able to ascertain who such parties are from proofs to be furnished by such surviving spouse or the heirs of the deceased, but it shall not be responsible for errors committed unless they are at once notified of the death of the owner and furnished with legal proof showing who is surviving spouse or the next of kin. It is therefore very important that the heirs or devisees file with the city legal proof of ownership for recording upon its books. The fee for recording and preserving such records by the city of Sumner shall be as listed in the fee schedule. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 5, 1928. Prior code § 10.02.090)


8.04.110 Right to interment.

A. That the surviving wife or husband shall have the first right to interment;

B. The original purchaser may at the time designate whom he wishes to have buried in the lot, which must be recorded on the books of the city; for which the recording will be charged as listed in the fee schedule. This notice must be in writing only, signed and acknowledged before a notary;

C. In case the original purchaser does not make such designation during his/her lifetime, the heirs of such purchaser may by an agreement in writing, duly signed by all of them, determine who among them shall have the right of burial in the lot;

D. In the event the original purchaser or his/her heirs have not arranged for future burials, the direct lineal descendants of such purchaser shall, in the order of their deaths, be entitled to interment therein until the lot shall be filled;

E. In such case, if there are no lineal descendants, then the nearest of kin to the purchaser shall have right to interment in the lot in the order of their deaths, until the lot shall be fully occupied. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 6, 1928. Prior code § 10.02.100)


8.04.120 Reconveyance of lots.

If the lot has been reconveyed in trust to the city, and in that reconveyance it is distinctly stated who is to be buried in the lot, and that nobody now interred in the lot or which may hereafter be buried in it shall ever be removed from it or disturbed, this lot becomes a sacred trust in the hands of the city and the wishes and intentions of the original lot owner will be carried out. A trust deed will be prepared in duplicate and recorded by the city. The recording charge will be as listed in the fee schedule. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 7, 1928.

A. A lot is intended as a family burial place of the purchaser, and therefore, while the purchaser may permit the interment in his/her lot of one, not a member of his/her family, an heir cannot, except by the unanimous consent of all the owners; but in no case shall any remuneration or consideration be accepted therefor.

B. Lot owners who desire to give the privilege for future interment to relatives or friends without consideration, must file such instructions with the city in writing, duly signed and acknowledged before a notary. The fee for recording names on the books of the city is as listed in the fee schedule and will be charged for each proposed interment. (Ord. 2511 § 1 (part), 2015: Ord. 378 § 14, 1928. Prior code § 10.02.180)


8.04.200 Interment – Position of grave.

A. A person is guilty of the crime of neglect of a child or dependent person if the person is a parent of a child, a person entrusted with the physical custody of a child or other dependent person, or a person employed to provide to the child or dependent person any of the basic necessities of life and, with criminal negligence, the person:

B. In any prosecution for neglect of a child or dependent person, it shall be a defense that the withholding of the basic necessities of life or the maintenance of living conditions that place the child or dependent person at a significant risk of disease, illness, or bodily injury is due to financial inability only if the person charged has made a reasonable effort to obtain adequate assistance. This defense is available to a person employed to provide the basic necessities of life only when the agreed-upon payment has not been made.

C. A person is criminally negligent or acts with criminal negligence when he or she fails to be aware of a substantial risk that a wrongful act may occur and his or her failure to be aware of such substantial risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.

9.12.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the importance of domestic violence as a serious crime against society and to assure the victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse which the law and those who enforce the law can provide. The city finds that the existing criminal ordinances are adequate to provide protection for victims of domestic violence; however, previous societal attitudes have been reflected in policies and practices of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors which have resulted in differing treatment of crimes occurring between cohabitants and the same crimes occurring between strangers. Only recently has public perception of the serious consequences of domestic violence to society and to the victims led to the recognition of the necessity for early intervention by law enforcement agencies. It is the intent of the city that the official response to cases of domestic violence shall stress the enforcement of the laws to protect the victim and shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior is not excused or tolerated. Furthermore, it is the intent of the city that criminal laws be enforced without regard to whether the persons involved are or were married, cohabiting, or involved in a traditional relationship. (Ord. 1264 § 1, 1984)


9.12.020 Definitions.

Repealed by Ord. 1784. (Ord. 1264 § 2, 1984)


9.12.030 Law enforcement officer training and conduct.

A. All training of law enforcement officers relating to the handling of domestic violence complaints shall stress enforcement of criminal laws in domestic situations, availability of community resources, and protection of the victim. Law enforcement agencies and community organizations with expertise in the issue of domestic violence shall cooperate in all aspects of such training.

B. The primary duty of peace officers when responding to a domestic violence situation is to enforce laws allegedly violated and to protect the complaining party.

C. When a peace officer responds to a domestic violence call and has probable cause to believe that a crime defined in this chapter as domestic violence has been committed, the peace officer shall exercise arrest powers with reference to the criteria in RCW 10.31.100 and city traffic ordinances identical thereto. The officer shall notify the victim of the victim’s rights to initiate criminal proceedings by citation or otherwise. The parties in such cases shall also be advised of the importance of preserving evidence.

D. A peace officer responding to a domestic violence call shall take a complete offense report, including the officer’s disposition of the case.

E. When a police officer responds to a domestic violence call, the officer shall advise victims of all reasonable means to prevent further abuse, including advising each person of the availability of a shelter or other services in the community, and giving each person immediate notice of the legal rights and remedies available. The notice shall include handing each person a copy of the following statement:

If you are the victim of domestic violence, you can ask the city or county prosecuting attorney to file a criminal complaint. You also have the right to file a petition in Superior, District, or Municipal Court requesting an order for protection from domestic abuse which could include any of the following:

(a) An order restraining your abuser from further acts of abuse;

(b) An order directing your abuser to leave your household;

(c) An order preventing your abuser from entering your residence, school, business, or place of employment;

(d) An order awarding you or the other parent custody of or visitation with your minor child or children; and

(e) An order restraining your abuser from molesting or interfering with minor children in your custody.

The forms you need to obtain a protection order are available in any Municipal, District, or Superior Court. Information about shelters and alternatives to domestic violence is available from a state-wide 24-hour toll-free hotline at 1-800-562-6025. The battered women’s shelter and other resources in this area are: (include current local information).

F. The peace officer may offer, arrange, or facilitate transportation for the victim to a hospital for treatment of injuries or to a place of safety or shelter.

G. The law enforcement agency shall forward the offense report to the appropriate prosecutor within 10 days of making such report if there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed, unless the case is under active investigation.

H. Each law enforcement agency shall make, as soon as practicable, a written record and shall maintain records of all incidents of domestic violence reported to it.

I. Records kept pursuant to subsections C and H of this section shall be made identifiable by means of a departmental code for domestic violence. (Ord. 1264 § 3, 1984)


9.12.040 Duties of court.

A. Because of the serious nature of domestic violence, the court, in domestic violence actions:

1. Shall not dismiss any charge or delay disposition because of concurrent dissolution or other civil proceedings;

2. Shall not require proof that either party is seeking a dissolution of marriage prior to instigation of criminal proceedings;

3. Shall waive any requirement that the victim’s location be disclosed to any person, other than the attorney of a criminal defendant, upon a showing that there is a possibility of further violence; provided that the court may order a criminal defense attorney not to disclose to his client the victim’s location; and

4. Shall identify by any reasonable means on docket sheets those criminal actions arising from acts of domestic violence.

B. Because of the likelihood of repeated violence directed at those who have been victims of domestic violence in the past, when any defendant charged with a crime involving domestic violence is released from custody before trial and sentencing on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may prohibit the defendant from having any contact with the victim. In such case, the court should determine whether the defendant should be prohibited from having any contact with the victim. If there is no outstanding restraining or protective order prohibiting the defendant from having contact with the victim, the court authorizing release may issue, by telephone, a no-contact order prohibiting the defendant from having contact with the victim. The no-contact order shall also be issued in writing as soon as possible. Wilful violation of a court order issued under this section is a misdemeanor, and any person convicted thereof may be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 or by imprisonment for no more than six months, or both. The written order releasing the defendant shall contain the court’s directives and shall bear the legend: “Violation of this order is a criminal offense under Ordinance No. 1264 of the City of Sumner, and will subject a violator to arrest.” A certified copy of the order shall be provided to the victim.

C. Whenever an order prohibiting contact is issued under subsection B of this section, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order, and the Sumner Police Department. Upon receipt of the copy of the order, the Sumner Police Department shall forthwith enter the order for one year into any computer-based criminal intelligence information system available in this state used by law enforcement agencies to list outstanding warrants. Entry into the law enforcement information system constitutes notices to all law enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. (Ord. 1264 § 4, 1984)

B. Whenever an order prohibiting contact is issued pursuant to this section, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order on or before the next judicial day to the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order, and the Sumner Police Department. Upon receipt of the copy of the order, the Sumner Police Department shall forthwith enter the order for one year into any computer-based criminal intelligence information system available in this state used by law enforcement agencies to list outstanding warrants.

9.47.040    SOAR orders – Violation.


9.47.005 Findings.

The zones listed in SMC 9.47.030 are frequented by illegal racers and those who attend illegal races. These zones attract illegal street racers and their spectators as the roads are straight, wide, and long, and traffic during the dark hours is not heavy. It is in these zones that street racers and their spectators cause damage to pavement, curbing, and street striping. Due to the volume of people that attend illegal street races in these zones, which can number in the hundreds, adjacent private property owners suffer economic loss due to the trash, human waste, and graffiti that is left behind. Street racers also cause damage to this private property by destroying planters and vegetation and parking lot black top. In addition, due to the high volume of people who attend illegal street races, there is a severe risk of danger to the street racers and their spectators. Spectators crowd the streets as vehicles race close by at excessive speeds. This uncontrolled racing environment has been known to cause serious injuries and death around the country. The zones listed in SMC 9.47.030 suffer a much higher incidence of illegal street racing and race attendance than other zones or areas of the city. (Ord. 2287 § 2 (part), 2009)


9.47.010 Stay out of areas of racing – Abbreviation.

As used in this title, the acronym “SOAR” represents “stay out of areas of racing.” (Ord. 2287 § 2 (part), 2009)


9.47.015 SOAR orders.

A SOAR order prohibits persons from engaging in racing or unlawful race attendance within a no racing zone, as set forth in SMC 9.47.030. (Ord. 2287 § 2 (part), 2009)


9.47.020 SOAR orders – Issuance.

A. The municipal court may issue a SOAR order to any person charged with racing, unlawful race attendance, reckless driving associated with race activity, or trespass associated with race activity as a condition of pre-trial release, sentence, or deferred sentence.

B. A person is deemed to have notice of the SOAR order when:

1. The signature of either the person named in the order or that of his or her attorney is affixed to the bottom of the order, which signature shall signify the person named in the order has read the order and has knowledge of the contents of the order; or

2. The order recites that the person named in the order, or his or her attorney, has appeared in person before the court at the time of issuance of the order.

C. The written SOAR order shall contain the court’s directives and shall bear the statement: “Violation of this order is a criminal offense under SMC 9.47.040 and will subject the violator to arrest.” (Ord. 2287 § 2 (part), 2009)


9.47.030 SOAR orders – Designated “no racing zones.”

The SOAR order may apply to any of the following “no racing zones”:

A. 142nd Avenue East from Tacoma Avenue North to 24th Street East.

B. 24th Street East from 136th Avenue East to 142nd Avenue East. 

C. Fryar Avenue from Main Street to Puyallup Street.

These “no racing zones” shall be designated by the placement of clear and conspicuous signs at all highway entrances to the no racing zone. At a minimum, these signs must include the following statements: “No Racing Zone; Race Attendance Prohibited; SMC 9.46.020 – SMC 9.47.030.” (Ord. 2287 § 2 (part), 2009)


9.47.040 SOAR orders – Violation. 

A. In the event a police officer has probable cause to believe that a person has been issued a SOAR order as a condition of pre-trial release or a sentence imposed by the court and, in the officer’s presence, the person is seen violating or failing to comply with any requirement or restriction set forth in the SOAR order, the officer may arrest the violator without warrant for violation of the SOAR order and shall bring that person before the court that issued the order.

B. When a SOAR order is issued pursuant to this chapter and the person so named in the order has notice of the order, a violation of any of the provisions of the SOAR order is a gross misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $5,000 or imprisonment not to exceed more than one year, or both.

9.50.010 Purpose. 

Chronic nuisance properties present grave health, safety and welfare concerns, which the property owners or persons in charge of such properties have failed to take corrective action to abate the nuisance condition. Chronic nuisance properties have a tremendous negative impact upon the quality of life, safety and health of the neighborhoods where they are located. This chapter is enacted to remedy nuisance activities that repeatedly occur or exist at chronic nuisance properties by providing a process for abatement; and this remedy is not an exclusive remedy available under any state or local laws and may be used in conjunction with such other laws.

Also, chronic nuisance properties are a financial burden to the city by the repeated calls for service to the properties because of the nuisance activities that repeatedly occur or exist on such property, and this chapter is a means to ameliorate those conditions and hold responsible the owners or persons in charge of such property. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)


9.50.020 Definitions. 

For purposes of this chapter, the following words or phrases shall have the meaning prescribed below:

A. “Abate” means to repair, replace, remove, destroy or otherwise remedy a condition which constitutes a violation of this chapter by such means and in such a manner and to such an extent as the applicable city department director or designee determines is necessary in the interest of the general health, safety and welfare of the community.

B. “Chronic nuisance property” means property on which three or more nuisance activities occur or exist during any 60-day period.

E. “Landlord” means the owner, lessor or sublessor of the dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part, and in addition, means any person designated as a representative of the landlord.

G. “Owner” means any person having any interest in the real estate in question as indicated in the records of the office of the Pierce County auditor, or who establishes under this chapter their ownership interest therein.

H. “Person” means natural person, joint venture, partnership, association, club, company, corporation, business trust, organization or the manager, lessee, agent, officer or employee of any of them.

I. “Person associated with a property” means any person who, on the occasion of a nuisance activity, has entered, patronized, visited, or attempted to enter, patronize or visit, or waited to enter, patronize or visit, a property or a person present on property, including without limitation any officer, director, customer, agent, employee or any independent contractor of a property, or a person in charge of or owner of a property.

J. “Person in charge” of a property means any person in actual or constructive possession of a property including, but not limited to, an owner, occupant, agent or property manager of a property under his control.

K. “Premises and property” may be used by this chapter interchangeably and means any building, lot, parcel, dwelling, rental unit, real estate or land or portion thereof including property used as residential or commercial property.

L. “Rental unit” means any structure or that part of a structure including, but not limited to, single-family home, room or apartment, which is rented to another and used as a home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)


9.50.030 Violation. 

A. Any property within the city of Sumner which is a chronic nuisance property is in violation of this chapter and subject to its remedies; and

B. Any person in charge who permits property to be a chronic nuisance property shall be in violation of this chapter and subject to its remedies. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)


9.50.040 Procedure.

A. When the chief of police, or his designee, receives police documentation confirming the occurrence of three or more nuisance activities within a 60-day period on the property, the chief of police, or his designee, may review such reports to determine whether they describe the nuisance activities enumerated in SMC 9.50.020.

B. Upon such a finding, the chief of police, or his designee, shall notify a property owner at the address shown on the county auditor records and shall notify the person in charge of the property in writing that the property is in danger of being declared a chronic nuisance property.

C. The notice shall contain:

1. The street address or a legal description sufficient for identification of the property;

2. A concise description of the nuisance activities that exist, or that have occurred on the property;

3. A demand that the owner or person in charge respond to the chief or his designee within 10 days of service of the notice to discuss the nuisance activities and create a plan to abate the chronic nuisance;

4. Offer the person in charge an opportunity to abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation; and

5. A statement describing that if legal action is sought, the property could be subject to closure, civil penalties and/or costs assessed up to $100.00 per day after the notice of the chronic nuisance property is received.

D. Such notice shall be either:

1. Personally served; or

2. Delivered by first class mail to the person in charge of the property with a copy mailed to the owner at the address indicated by the Pierce County auditor, if different than the person in charge of the property.

E. If the person in charge fails to respond to the notice within the time prescribed, the chief of police, or his designee, shall post such notice at the property and issue the person in charge a Class 1 civil infraction.

If the person in charge fails to respond to the issued infraction the matter shall be referred to the office of the city attorney for further action.

If the person in charge responds as required by the notice and agrees to abate the nuisance activity, the chief of police, or his designee, and the person in charge and/or property owner may work out an agreed-upon course of action which would abate the nuisance activity.

If an agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activities or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached, the matter shall be forwarded to the office of the city attorney for enforcement action.

F. It is a defense to an action for chronic nuisance property that the person in charge at all material times could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become chronic nuisance property, or could not in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence control the conduct leading to the determination that the property is chronic nuisance property. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)


9.50.050 Commencement of action – Enforcement.

A. Once the matter is referred to the city attorney, the city attorney shall immediately review and make a determination to initiate legal action authorized under this chapter or state statute, or may seek alternative forms of abatement of the nuisance activity. The city attorney may initiate legal action on the chronic nuisance property and seek civil penalties and costs in superior court for the abatement of the nuisance.

B. In determining whether a property shall be deemed a chronic nuisance property and subject to the court’s jurisdiction, the city shall have the initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. The city may submit official police reports and other affidavits outlining the information that led to arrest(s) and other chronic nuisance activity occurring or existing at the property. The failure to prosecute an individual, or the fact no one has been convicted of a crime, is not a defense to a chronic nuisance action.

C. Once a superior court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance under this chapter the court may impose a civil penalty against any or all of the persons in charge of the property and/or the owner of the property, and may order any other relief deemed appropriate. A civil penalty may be assessed for up to $100.00 per day for each day the nuisance activity continues to occur following the date of the original notice by the chief of police, or his designee, as described in SMC 9.50.040. In assessing the civil penalty, the court may consider the following factors, citing to those found applicable:

1. The actions taken by the person in charge and/or owner to mitigate or correct the nuisance activity;

2. The financial condition of the persons in charge;

3. The repeated or continuous nature of the nuisance activity;

4. The statements of the neighbors or those affected by the nuisance activity; and

5. Any other factor deemed relevant by the court.

D. The superior court which determined the property to be a chronic nuisance property shall also assess costs against the person in charge and/or owner in the amount it costs the city to abate, or attempt to abate, the nuisance activity.

E. If the superior court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance property, the superior court shall order the property closed and secured against all unauthorized access, use and occupancy for a period up to one year, and may impose a civil penalty and costs.

F. Once a determination has been made by the superior court that the chronic nuisance property shall be subject to closure, the court may authorize the city to physically secure the premises and initiate such closure.

Costs for such closure shall be submitted to the court for review. Any civil penalty and/or costs awarded to the city may be filed with the city treasurer who shall cause the same to be filed as a lien on the property with the county treasurer. The city shall file a formal lis pendens notice when an action for abatement is filed in the superior court.

G. The superior court shall retain jurisdiction during any period of closure or abatement of the property.

H. Sumner municipal court is to have jurisdiction of all civil infractions issued pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)


9.50.060 Summary closure. 

Nothing in this chapter prohibits the city from taking any emergency action for the summary closure of such property when it is necessary to avoid an immediate threat to public welfare and safety. The city may take summary action to close the property without complying with the notification provisions of SMC 9.50.040, but shall provide such notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)


9.50.070 Severability. 

If any portion of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any other portion thereof, or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected. (Ord. 2539 § 1 (part), 2015)

In making speed limit determinations, the director of public works or his/her designee shall consider traffic levels of service and safety in light of relevant circumstances and applicable factors. Any streets with a different maximum speed limit than 25 miles per hour shall be posted with appropriate signage. (Ord. 2382 § 1 (part), 2012)

10.36.070 Restricted parking zones.

A. Authority for Administration of Restricted Parking Zones. The city of Sumner, by ordinance, may establish a restricted parking zone in which:

1. Parking in the street is reserved for the exclusive use of abutting properties and/or residents in a prescribed vicinity; vehicles used by their visitors; and service vehicles of persons having business in the street; or

2. Parking in the street is reserved during certain posted hours for such exclusive use and available at all other times without restriction; or

3. Time limits are established for parking in the street which apply to all vehicles except vehicles owned or used by such residents, their visitors or service vehicles of persons having business in the street or with the residents; or

4. Each restricted parking zone shall be subject to review by the city council after its first six months of operation; or

5. In any restricted parking zone, the city may issue permits or other means of identification, maintain lists of vehicles owned or used by residents, or adopt any other reasonable means of distinguishing vehicles that may validly be parked in any restricted parking zone from other vehicles. The establishment of restricted parking zones shall not limit parking of vehicles displaying a card or decal issued pursuant to RCW 46.16.381. Restricted parking zones shall be appropriately signed and/or marked.

B. Establishing Restricted Parking Zones. Restricted parking zones may be established either:

1. Upon a petition of the majority of the residential households in a neighborhood, which is presented to the director of community development; the director of community development may recommend to the city council establishment of a restricted parking zone whenever 60 percent or more of the capacity of the streets available for parking in such neighborhood is generally occupied during regular business hours or any consecutive six-hour period on both Saturdays and Sundays, or any consecutive four-hour period for five consecutive days, Monday through Friday, during nonbusiness hours; at least 30 percent of the vehicles parked on the street in the area during such hours are not owned by residents of the immediate neighborhood, persons visiting them, or doing business in the street or with such residents; and the public interest would be served. If a petition initiates the process, the director of community development, after review by the director of public works, shall, within 180 days, forward the petition, with recommendations thereon, to the city council; or

2. Upon a recommendation from the community development director which is presented to the city council. Such a recommendation shall be made as part of an area-wide strategy for addressing parking issues in a particular area of the city. The strategy shall be presented for consideration to the city council at a public hearing and the adoption of an enabling ordinance. 

C. Repeal of Restricted Parking Zone. Notwithstanding the authority granted the director of public works in subsection E of this section to recommend the abolition of restricted parking zones, the majority of the residents of a neighborhood, which has been designated a restricted parking zone, may petition the city to remove such parking restrictions in that neighborhood that were originally established under the authority of this section. The director of community development, after review by the director of public works, shall forward the petition, with recommendations thereon, to the city council.

D. Director of Community Development – Authority. The director of community development, or his/her designee, will process applications for restricted parking zones, recommend designation of restricted parking zones, and implement rules and regulations for the use of restricted parking zones and the issuance, use, and revocation of permits.

E. Director of Public Works – Authority. The director of public works, or his/her designee, will recommend the establishment, revision, or abolition of restricted parking zones as described in this section, and shall hear, review, and approve or disapprove any protests or appeals regarding the issuance or denial of any permit, or the installation of any traffic control device or the establishment of any regulation pursuant to this section. The director may recommend the establishment, revision, or abolition of restricted parking zones as outlined in this section. The director will make surveys and recommendations with respect to restricted parking zones and make appropriate recommendations to the director of community development.

F. Restricted Parking Zone Defined. A portion of the street commonly used for vehicular parking, which, except as to vehicles displaying a card or decal issued pursuant to RCW 46.16.381, is:

1. Reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles owned or used by residents of the abutting properties and/or residents in the prescribed vicinity and vehicles used by their visitors; and service vehicles of persons having business in the street or with abutting or nearby residents;

2. Reserved for such exclusive use during certain hours; or

3. Subject to time limits that apply to parking of all vehicles except vehicles owned or used by such residents or their visitors, or service vehicles of persons having business in the street or with the residents.

G. Neighborhood Defined. For the purpose of this section, a “neighborhood” shall be defined as both sides of the traveled portion of the street for a minimum distance of one city block.

H. Restricted Parking Zone. No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle in violation of the posted or marked restrictions or when a permit or other authorization issued by the city is required as a condition for parking the same, or without a card or decal issued pursuant to RCW 46.16.381 being displayed in a prominent place on the vehicle.

10.72.030 Redemption of impounded vehicles.

Vehicles impounded by the city shall be redeemed only under the following circumstances:

A. Only the registered owner, a person authorized by the registered owner, or one who has purchased the vehicle from the registered owner, who produces proof of ownership or authorization and signs a receipt therefor, may redeem an impounded vehicle. A person redeeming a vehicle impounded pursuant to the above section must, prior to redemption, establish that he or she has a valid driver’s license.

B. Any person so redeeming a vehicle impounded by the city shall pay the towing contractor for the costs of impoundment, including removal, towing and storage. The administrative fee shall be paid to the city of Sumner at the finance department prior to redeeming such vehicle. The towing contractor shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120(1)(b), as now or hereafter amended. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to the above and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines, or forfeitures owed by the registered owner have been satisfied.

C. The chief of police is authorized to release a vehicle impounded prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment upon petition of the spouse of the driver based upon economic or personal hardship to such spouse resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from the release of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the driver’s criminal history, driving record, license status and access to the vehicle. If such release is authorized, the person redeeming the vehicle must satisfy the requirements of this section.

D. Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a traffic citation has a right to a hearing before an administrative hearings officer to contest the validity of the impoundment or the amount of removal, towing and storage charges or the administrative fee if such request for hearing is in writing, in the form approved by the chief of police and signed by such person, and is received by the chief of police within 10 days (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the latter of the date the notice was mailed to such person pursuant to the above section, or the date the notice was given to such person by the registered tow truck operator pursuant to RCW 46.55.120(2)(a). Such hearing shall be provided as follows:

1. If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including the expiration of any period of impoundment have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall be released immediately and a hearing shall be held within 90 days from the written request for hearing.

2. If not all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including the expiration of any period of impoundment, have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall not be released until after the hearing, which shall be scheduled within two business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the written request for the hearing.

3. Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within the time specified may petition the chief of police for an extension to file a request for hearing. Such extension shall be granted only upon the demonstration of good cause as to the reason(s) the request for the hearing was not timely filed. For the purposes of this section, good cause shall be defined as circumstances beyond the control of the person seeking the hearing that prevented such person from filing a timely request for hearing. In the event such extension is granted, the person receiving such extension shall be granted a hearing in accordance with this chapter.

4. If a person fails to file a timely request for hearing and no extension to file such a request has been granted, the right to a hearing is waived, the impoundment and the associated costs of impoundment and administrative fee are deemed to be proper, and the city shall not be liable for removal, towing and storage charges arising from the impoundment.

5. In accordance with RCW 46.55.240 (1)(d), a decision made by the administrative hearings officer may be appealed to the municipal court for final judgment. The hearing on the appeal under this subsection shall be de novo. A person appealing such decision must file a request for an appeal in the municipal court within 15 days after the decision of the administrative hearings officer and must pay a filing fee in the same amount required for the filing of a suit in district court at the time of said request. If a person fails to file a request for an appeal within the time specified by this section or does not pay the filing fee, the right to appeal is waived and the administrative hearings officer’s decision is final. (Ord. 1914 § 3, 2000: Ord. 1866 § 4, 1999)


10.72.040 Post-impoundment hearing procedure.

Hearings requested shall be held by an administrative hearings officer, who shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing, storage and administrative fees were proper.

A. At the hearing, an abstract of the driver’s driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver’s license, permit, or privilege to drive and that the driver was convicted of each offense shown on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.

B. If the impoundment is found to be proper, the administrative hearings officer shall enter an order so stating. In the event the costs of impoundment (removal, towing and storage) and the administrative fee have not been paid or any other applicable requirements have not been satisfied or any period of impoundment has not expired, the administrative hearings officer’s order shall also provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment to the city of the administrative fee and any fines imposed upon any of the underlying traffic citations and satisfaction of all other applicable requirements and payment of the costs of impoundment to the towing company and after the expiration of any period of impoundment set forth above.

C. If the impoundment is found to be improper, the administrative hearings officer shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. If the costs of impoundment and administrative fee have already been paid, the administrative hearings officer shall enter a judgment against the city and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment and administrative fee in the amount of the costs of this impoundment and administrative fee.

D. In the event the administrative hearings officer finds that the impoundment was proper, but the removal, towing, storage or administrative fee charged for impoundment were improper, the administrative hearings officer shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment and the administrative fee have been paid, the administrative hearings officer shall enter a judgment against the city and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment and administrative fee for the amount of the overpayment.

E. No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution and such determination shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

F. An appeal of the administrative hearings officer’s decision in municipal court shall be conducted according to, and is subject to, the procedures of this section. If the court finds that the impoundment or the removal, towing, storage or administrative fees are improper, any judgment entered against the city shall include the amount of the filing fee. (Ord. 1914 § 4, 2000: Ord. 1866 § 5, 1999)


10.72.050 Contract for towing and storage – Administrative fee.

A. If a vehicle is impounded pursuant to the above section, the administrative fee of $75.00 shall be levied when the vehicle is redeemed under the specifications of the contract provided for.

B. The administrative fee shall be collected by the city of Sumner at the finance department in the manner directed by the city administrator. The administrative fee shall be for the purpose of offsetting, to the extent practical, the cost of the city of implementing, enforcing and administering the provisions of this chapter and shall be deposited in the appropriate account. (Ord. 1914 § 5, 2000: Ord. 1866 § 6, 1999)

12.02.010 Vision.

Promoting pedestrian, bicycle, and public transportation travel reduces negative environmental impacts, promotes healthy living, advances the well-being of travelers, supports the goal of compact development, and meets the needs of the diverse populations that comprise our communities. The vision of the city of Sumner (city) is of a community in which all residents and visitors, regardless of their age, ability, or financial resources, can safely and efficiently use the public right-of-way to meet their transportation needs regardless of their preferred mode of travel. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.020 Policy.

The city will plan for, design, construct, operate, and maintain an appropriate and integrated transportation system that will meet the needs of motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, wheelchair users, transit vehicles and riders, freight haulers, emergency responders, and residents of all ages and abilities.

Transportation facilities that support the concept of complete streets include, but are not limited to, pavement markings and signs, street and sidewalk lighting, sidewalk and pedestrian safety improvements, Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI compliance, transit accommodations, bicycle accommodations including appropriate signage and markings, and as appropriate streetscapes that appeal to and promote pedestrian use.

The system’s design will be consistent with and supportive of local neighborhoods, recognizing that transportation needs vary and must be balanced in a flexible, safe, and cost effective manner. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.030 Projects.

Those involved in the planning and design of projects within the public right-of-way will give consideration to all users and modes of travel from the start of planning and design work. Transportation improvements shall be viewed as opportunities to create safer, more accessible streets for all users. This shall apply to new construction, reconstruction, and rehabilitation. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.040 Exceptions.

Exceptions to this policy shall be determined by the public works director, city administrator, or mayor under the circumstances listed below:

A. Street projects may exclude those elements of this policy that would require the accommodation of street uses prohibited by law;

B. Ordinary maintenance activities such as mowing, snowplowing, sweeping, spot repair, joint or crack sealing, or pothole filling do not require that elements of this policy be applied beyond the scope of that maintenance activity;

C. Ordinary maintenance paving projects should include evaluating the condition of existing facilities supporting alternate transportation modes as well as modifying existing pavement markings and signage that supports such alternative modes as appropriate;

D. Street reconstruction projects and maintenance paving projects which involve widening pavement may exclude elements of this policy when the accommodation of a specific use is expected to:

1. Require more space than is physically available; or

2. Be located where both current and future demand is proven absent; or

3. Drastically increase project costs and equivalent alternatives exist within close proximity; or

4. Have adverse impacts on environmental resources such as streams, wetlands, floodplains, or on historic structures or sites above and beyond the impacts of currently existing infrastructure; or

5. The cost would be disproportionate to the current need or probable future use.

E. Street projects may exclude the development of sidewalks in areas falling outside those identified as appropriate for sidewalks on the basis of an adopted sidewalk policy. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.050 Intergovernmental cooperation.

The city will cooperate with other transportation agencies including the Washington State Department of Transportation and Pierce County to ensure the principles and practices of complete streets are embedded within their planning, design, construction, and maintenance activities. The city will specifically cooperate to ensure the transportation network flows seamlessly between jurisdictions in accordance with local and regional road, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian plans. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.060 Design criteria.

The city, through its public works and community development departments, shall maintain design criteria, standards and guidelines based upon recognized best practices in street design, construction and operation as identified in the current City of Sumner Development Specifications and Standard Details. To the greatest extent possible, the city shall adopt the same standards with particular emphasis on pedestrian and bicycle markings and wayfinding signage (as permitted through city of Sumner Municipal Code). Resources to be referenced in developing these standards shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the latest editions of: American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, Washington State Department of Transportation Design Manual, and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.070 Community context.

Implementation of this policy shall take into account the goal of enhancing the context and character of the surrounding built and natural environments. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.080 Network.

Appropriate attention should be given to projects which enhance the overall transportation system and its connectivity for access to parks or recreation areas, schools, shopping/commercial areas, public transportation, employment centers, existing pedestrian or bicycle networks, or regional bicycle pedestrian plans prepared by other associated groups such as Pierce County. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.090 Performance measures.

The public works director and/or designees shall report to the planning commission and city council on an annual basis on the transportation projects undertaken within the prior year and planned within the coming six-year period and the extent to which each of these projects has met the objectives of this policy. (Ord. 2578 § 1 (part), 2016)


12.02.100 Implementation.

This policy will be primarily implemented through developing bike and pedestrian network plans on a regional basis within the city and in conjunction with Pierce County’s regional plans. These plans shall specify the type and location of improvements and shall be implemented as funding becomes available. Special emphasis shall be placed on those elements of these plans that can be accomplished with little or no additional expense, such as providing bike lanes where existing pavement is adequate or where road shoulders are sufficient to allow for safe bicycle use.

12.36.050 Assessment of impact fees. 

A. The city shall collect transportation impact fees from any applicant seeking a building permit from the city for any development activity within the city.

B. The impact fee amount is generally calculated by using the following formula:

	Amount of Transportation Impact Fee for development use = Number of units of land use X Net new trip rate for that land use X Car equivalency X Current Adopted Transportation Impact Fee Per New P.M. Peak Hour Trip for the District.

1. The number of units of each use is determined as follows: (a) for residential uses it is the number of dwelling units for which a building permit application has been made; and (b) for office, retail, or manufacturing uses it is the gross floor area of building(s) to be used for each use expressed in square feet divided by 1,000 square feet, or in the units defined in the schedules. 

2. Using the formula in this subsection (B), transportation impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use. The transportation impact fees that shall be due are the sum of these calculations.

3. If a development activity will include more than one use in a building or site, then the transportation impact fee shall be determined using the above formula by apportioning the space committed to the various uses specified on the schedule.

4. If the type of use or development activity is not specified on the transportation impact fee schedules, the director shall use the transportation impact fee applicable to the most comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The director shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the Trip Generation Manual.

5. In the case of a change in use, development activity, redevelopment, or expansion or modification of an existing use, the transportation impact fee shall be based upon the net positive increase in the number of new p.m. peak hour trips added by the new development activity as compared to the number of p.m. peak hour trips for the previous land use activity.

C. The amount of impact fees shall be determined at the time of building permit issuance, using the impact fee schedules then in effect, or pursuant to an independent fee calculation accepted by the director pursuant to SMC 12.36.060, and adjusted for any credits pursuant to SMC 12.36.070.

D. Payment of impact fees shall be made by the feepayer either: (1) at the time the building permit is issued; or (2) deferred as per subsection (G) of this section. 

E. Applicants that have been awarded credits prior to the submittal of the complete building permit application pursuant to SMC 12.36.070 shall submit, along with the complete building permit application, a copy of the letter or certificate prepared by the director or his/her designee pursuant to SMC 12.36.070 setting forth the amount of the credit awarded. Impact fees, as determined after the application of appropriate credits, shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued.

F. The department shall not issue a building permit unless and until the impact fees have been paid or credit(s) awarded or payments have been deferred per subsection (G) of this section.

G. Deferral of Payment of Transportation Impact Fees. An applicant for a building or site development permit may request a deferral of the full transportation impact fee payment until final construction inspection or 18 months from the date of original permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of transportation impact fees, and the application process for a deferral, shall be in accordance with the provisions and requirements of SMC 3.50.115(A)(1) through (11) as currently written or hereafter amended.

H. Three districts are established by the Transportation Impact Fee District Map.

1. The boundaries of the districts are shown on the official Transportation Impact Fee District Map which, together with all explanatory matters thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this title.

2. Each district map shall be, upon its final adoption, a part of this title, and the map, all notations, references and other information shown shall be made a part of this title as though all matters and information set forth on the map were fully described herein.

3. The official Transportation Impact Fee District Map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk and shall bear the seal of the city of Sumner. The original of the official Transportation Impact Fee District Map shall be retained in the office of the city clerk.

Transportation Impact Per Trip Fee Schedule, Indexed to Seattle Cost Construction Index as of July 1, 2019  

	District 1	$1,729.00

	District 2	$2,756.55

	District 3	$3,041.75

I. Effective October 1st of each year, the impact fee rates shall be adjusted according to the Seattle Construction Cost Index (SCCI). (Ord. 2711 § 2, 2019: Ord. 2698 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2019: Ord. 2576 § 3, 2016: Ord. 2554 § 1, 2015: Ord. 2473 § 3, 2014; Ord. 2417 § 3, 2012; Ord. 2348 § 3, 2011: Ord. 2041 § 1 (part), 2003)


12.36.060 Independent fee calculations. 

A. If in the judgment of the director or his/her designee, none of the fee categories set forth in the impact fee schedule guideline in effect at that time and on file in the public works department accurately describes or captures the impacts of the new development, the applicant shall conduct an independent fee calculation and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations, once accepted by the city. 

B. Feepayers may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the impact fee schedule guideline in effect at that time and on file in the public works department. Such feepayers shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The independent fee calculation shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the state of Washington with expertise completing such calculations.

C. The documentation submitted and supporting an independent fee calculation shall clearly show new p.m. peak hour trip generation characteristics of the proposed development based on industry-accepted standards from the Trip Generation Manual or as determined from actual field studies. The modified fee shall be based on the cost per equivalent car trips established herein, and shall consider the alternative trip generation data. 

D. An administrative fee shall be charged for each independent fee calculation. The city may adjust the amount of the deposit at any time, as necessary, to pay for the appropriate review of the independent fee calculation. These fees shall be based on the city’s actual expended direct and indirect costs and expenses. Statements will include invoice documentation and are mailed monthly. Payment is due by the first of the following month as shown on the billing statement. A monthly finance charge of one percent of the ending balance will be assessed on all unpaid balances. If no payment is made within 60 days, the account will be considered past due and all further city staff work on the project may be suspended. After 90 days past due, the city may take whatever action is necessary to collect past due amounts including referring the matter to the city attorney and/or a collection agency. The feepayer shall also pay reasonable fees to the city, in addition to the amount identified, if the city is required to perform additional work relating to the application, which may include, but is not limited to, the following:

1. Additional support services which shall include but are not limited to a traffic analysis.

2. Acts by the applicant which require that the city staff spend extraordinary time on related issues.

3. The city’s need to obtain consulting support services to assist the city when the scope of the application is beyond the city’s expertise or the city’s ability to review within a reasonable time. Authorization from the owner shall be required before the city enlists project consulting support services.

After the city completes its review, the actual costs and expenses will be determined and the cash deposit shall be adjusted to provide for a refund by the city or additional payment by the feepayer.

E. While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in the Trip Generation Manual are valid, the director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer, but is not required to accept such documentation which the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. 

F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the office of the hearing examiner subject to the procedures set forth in SMC 12.36.090. (Ord. 2698 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2019: Ord. 2041 § 1 (part), 2003)


12.36.070 Credits and adjustments. 

A. A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for transportation impact fees be awarded to him/her for transportation project improvements provided by the feepayer if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are identified as transportation system improvements that provide capacity to serve new growth in the transportation plan, or the director, at his/her discretion, makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the transportation goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan.

B. For each request for a credit or credits, the director shall determine the value of dedicated land by using available documentation or selecting an appraiser from a list of independent appraisers maintained by the department to determine the value of the land being dedicated. The value of land dedicated as right-of-way and qualifying for a credit in new developments shall be based on actual predevelopment worth. The value of the improvements shall be based on the actual cost as determined through documentation submitted by the feepayer.

C. The feepayer shall pay the cost of the appraisal and shall deposit on account the estimated cost of the appraisal as determined by the director at the time the feepayer requests consideration for a credit. 

D. After receiving the appraisal, the director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, where applicable, the legal description of the site donated, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate, and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit.

E. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 

F. No credit shall be given for transportation project improvements or right-of-way dedications for direct access improvements to and/or within the development in question. 

G. Credits shall be based on the current transportation impact fees in effect at the time the credit is approved by the director. The city shall keep a record of these credits and apply them to future development permits. The statute of limitation for these credits is 10 years from the date of approval of the credit and the date a complete permit application is filed with the city. 

H. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in SMC 12.36.090.

I. Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the fee rate schedule, Attachment A*, has been reasonably adjusted for other revenue sources which are earmarked for, or proratable to, funding transportation facilities. (Ord. 2698 § 1 (Exh. A) (part), 2019: Ord. 2041 § 1 (part), 2003)

*Code reviser’s note: Attachment A is attached to Ordinance 2041 and is on file in the city clerk’s office.

12.38.010 Findings, purpose and authority. 

A. The city council finds and determines that new residential growth and development in the city will create additional demand and need for public facilities (parks) in the city and finds that new residential growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of new public facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The city has conducted an extensive study documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new residential developments on public facilities and has prepared a rate study as identified below. The city council accepts the methodology and data contained in the rate study. Therefore, pursuant to the city’s police powers, the Growth Management Act as codified in Chapter 36.70A RCW (“the Act”) and the impact fee statutes as codified in RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100, the city council adopts this chapter to assess impact fees for public facilities.

B. The purpose of this chapter is to:

1. Develop a program consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan for joint public and private financing of park facilities as defined in SMC 12.38.020 consistent with the capital facilities plan of the city of Sumner comprehensive plan, as such public facilities are necessitated in whole or in part by development in the city;

2. Ensure adequate levels of service in park facilities;

3. Create a mechanism to charge and collect fees to ensure that all new development bears its proportionate share of the capital costs of park facilities reasonably related to new development, in order to ensure the availability of adequate park facilities at the time new development occurs; and

4. Ensure fair collection and administration of such impact fees.

C. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to effectively carry out its purpose in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 2628 § 2 (part), 2018)

A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest bearing account established by the city solely for the city’s park impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the city shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.

B. Impact fees for park system improvements shall be expended by the city for capital improvements including but not limited to park planning, land surveys, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, capital equipment pertaining to recreational facilities, and any other expenses which could be capitalized, and which are consistent with the city’s capital facilities element of its comprehensive plan or the city’s parks and trails plan.

C. Impact fees may be used to recoup costs for system improvements previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed system improvements.

D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.

E. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the city for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the city, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years.

F. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt of the funds by the city on park facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The city shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records.

G. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the city in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the city in conformance with the capital facilities element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.

H. Should the city seek to terminate any or all park impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a park impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended by the city, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

I. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:

1. The developer has not received final plat approval, the building permit, the mobile home permit, the site plan approval, nor final approval for the development activity as required by statute or municipal code including the International Building Code; and

2. No impact on the city has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the city has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the city has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the city and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The city shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in SMC 12.38.085.

J. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the city on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 2628 § 2 (part), 2018)

12.52.015 Policy.

It is the policy of the city, as implemented through this code and any procedures adopted hereunder, to recognize the substantial community benefits that result from special events. These events provide cultural enrichment, promote economic vitality, and enhance community identity and pride. They also may provide opportunities for family activities and funding for our community’s nonprofit agencies. Partnerships between the city, event sponsors and the community are valuable in ensuring successful events. Therefore, the city will strive to accommodate special events. The city recognizes that events can be difficult to implement successfully and that the city requirements may represent a significant portion of an event’s costs. When setting fees and conditions for events, the city will be sensitive to their impacts on the event’s costs while balancing the city’s obligation to protect public health and safety. It is the city’s goal to have successful special events that enrich and enliven the community.

It is the policy of the city that events be staged in various areas in Sumner when feasible, thus encouraging the participation by a greater number of Sumner citizens. The city also recognizes that certain events are site-specific; therefore flexibility is important when determining event locations. (Ord. 2564 § 1 (part), 2016)

12.60.185 Public facility – Criminal activity – Prohibition of entry.

A. The city council finds that, from time to time, the right of the general public to enjoy public facilities provided by the city is infringed upon by persons who engage in criminal conduct at the public facilities or who possess and consume alcohol at the public facilities. The city council further finds that the right of persons who engage in criminal activity at public facilities is outweighed by the right of law abiding citizens to use such facilities without the interference or fear of the criminal activity of others. 

B. Whenever a police officer or a judge, commissioner, or judge pro tempore of the Sumner municipal court has probable cause to believe that a person has committed any act set forth in subsection (D) of this section on any public facility as defined in this chapter, that person may be given a written order prohibiting that person from entering the public facility where the act was committed. When issued by a police officer, the order shall remain effective for 45 days; provided, that in the event the person is charged with a crime or infraction that gives rise to the issuance of such order, the order shall remain effective until the person is arraigned for such charge or appears for a hearing for such infraction. In the event the person is charged with a crime or infraction that gives rise to the issuance of the prohibition of entry, the judge, commissioner, or judge pro tempore shall, upon finding probable cause, issue, reissue, or extend the order that shall remain effective for the period in which the court retains jurisdiction over the matter.

C. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a person is on or has entered a public facility and such person is prohibited from being on or entering the public facility pursuant to this section, the officer may arrest the person for violating the prohibition of entry.

D. An act which may result in the issuance of a written order prohibiting a person from entering a public facility may consist of any of the following when committed in or on the public facility:

5. Any act that involves entering an area defined as a public facility in this chapter after the area is closed to the public. 

E. In the event that no criminal charges are filed as a result of the activity that leads to the police officer’s issuance of the order prohibiting entry, the person prohibited from entering the public facility may request to have the order removed prior to the expiration of the 45-day period. Such request shall be filed with the city attorney’s office. Such request shall contain a valid return address or contact information sufficient to enable the court to provide written notice of court dates. Within five days of receipt of the request for hearing, the city attorney’s office shall submit a request for hearing to the Sumner municipal court. The court shall set a hearing to be held within 10 days of the date such request for hearing is received by the court from the city’s legal department. The city must establish that probable cause exists to believe that the person committed any act set forth in subsection (D) of this section.

The sworn declaration may be supplemented by the testimony of witnesses and the presentation of other evidence. The person against whom the order was issued shall have the opportunity to present evidence and testimony when challenging the order.

F. A person who violates any prohibition of entry issued pursuant to this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 

Public facilities are those places, buildings, and areas as set forth in SMC 12.60.020 as currently enacted or hereafter amended. (Ord. 2677 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 2480 § 1 (part), 2014: Ord. 2245 § 4, 2007)

It is unlawful for anyone to use any public right-of-way for private purposes without a written permit from the city of Sumner and without complying with all of the provisions of this chapter in relation thereto; provided, that nothing herein contained shall apply to street maintenance work performed by the city of Sumner, utility installations covered by franchise, street or sewer installation and improvement work authorized by ordinance, or street improvement projects under contract with the city of Sumner. (Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.030 Application – Information required.

Application for permits herein provided for shall be filed with the director of public works of the city of Sumner upon a form provided by public works, which application shall contain:

(Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.040 Processing of application.

The director of public works shall cause each application to be examined to determine if it complies with the provisions of this chapter. Representatives of the city of Sumner shall inspect the premises which are desired to be used to determine whether or not the proposed use conforms with the provisions of this chapter. Any application for a permit to construct, erect, or maintain any building, structure, or use on or under the surface of the property shall ascertain if the plans and specifications conform to the regulations pertaining to safety, material, and design of the Sumner building code and zoning code. The building official shall then endorse his findings upon the application and transmit the same to the director of public works. If the director of public works determines that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter and also that the proposed use of such public place will not unreasonably limit or encroach upon the public’s right to travel upon said right-of-way, or the ancillary right to occupy said right-of-way for utility purposes, the director of public works may approve the application. If approved, the director of public works shall fix the time for which the permit may be granted and shall cause to be issued a permit upon the applicant’s compliance as herein specified with the provisions of this chapter relating to indemnity of the city of Sumner. In approving said permit, the director of public works may impose such reasonable conditions as are required to meet the standards set forth in this chapter and to protect the paramount rights-of-way for travel and to protect the safety of the traveling public and other public purposes. (Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.050 Indemnity deposit on approved applications for permit.

If the director of public works determines that there is a probability of expense to the city arising from the applicant’s proposed use of public right-of-way, the applicant shall deposit with the director of public works a cash deposit. The amount of the cash indemnity deposit shall be determined by the director of public works at the time of approving the application and shall be governed by the anticipated amount and extent of expense to the city as determined by the director of public works. Such indemnity deposit shall be used to pay the cost, plus 15 percent thereof, of inspections, surveys, plans and other services performed by the city, of: restoring the street, removing any earth or other debris from the street, replacing any utility interrupted or damaged, or completing any work left unfinished; drafting of an indemnity agreement with the city, if such an agreement is required within the permit; and any other expenses the city may sustain in conjunction with the permitted work. The balance of the cash indemnity deposit, if any, after the foregoing deductions, shall be returned to the applicant. If the indemnity deposit is insufficient, the applicant will be liable for the deficiency. If the director of public works determines that engineering studies must be made prior to the approval of any application for permit, the cost of such study shall be paid for by the applicant or deducted from his indemnity deposit. The director of public works may require the applicant to file with the city a surety bond approved as to surety and as to form by the city attorney, which bond shall run for the full period of said permit, in a sum to be determined by the director of public works, but not less than $2,000, and conditioned that such applicant shall faithfully maintain such installation in a safe and secure condition and shall faithfully comply with all the terms of the permit and all the provisions of this chapter and all other ordinances of the city of Sumner and shall faithfully perform the removal of, or reimburse the city for the cost of removing, such installation and restoring the right-of-way to the same or better condition as though such installation had not existed, upon the revocation or voluntary termination of said permit. (Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.060 Indemnity to save the city harmless from claims.

The director of public works may require the applicant to file with the department of public works, prior to the effective date of such permit, a certified copy, together with evidence of premium payment, of a comprehensive general insurance policy in a form approved by the city attorney, issued by a company duly authorized to do business in the state of Washington. Said policy shall run for the duration of the permit. Coverage provided by the insurance policy shall include, but shall not be limited to, all of the usual coverages commonly referred to by the insurance industry as: operations liability products/completed operations liability and contractor’s protective liability blanket contractual liability. The insurance policy shall: (1) name the city of Sumner as an additional insured; (2) apply as primary insurance, regardless of any insurance which the city may carry; (3) include a “cross-liability” (severability of interest) clause; and (4) include limits of protection of not less than $500,000 combined single limit, bodily injury and property damage. It is to be understood and agreed that the obligation to permittee to hold harmless the city from claims for damages arising out of the operations related to the permit shall not be limited to the amount of insurance provided by the permittee. The insurance policy shall further contain a clause obligating the company issuing the same to give to the city attorney of the city of Sumner 30 days’ notice before the cancellation of said policy. If the application is for a permit to construct or maintain an areaway, fuel opening, sidewalk elevator or door, or to use or occupy the planting strip by erecting a bulkhead, steps, retaining wall, rockery, structure, or any facility therein, in addition to the foregoing comprehensive general insurance policy, the owner of the premises in front of which, and in connection with which, the same is to be constructed, erected, maintained, used, or occupied, and any existing lessee, sublessee, tenant, and/or subtenant using or occupying the basement of the premises in connection with which such structure is to be used, before the permit is issued, shall, in the manner provided by law for the execution of deeds, execute and deliver to the city of Sumner upon a form to be supplied by the director of public works, an agreement in writing, signed and acknowledged by such owners and by such existing lessee, sublessee, tenant, and/or subtenant, and containing an accurate legal description of said premises and a covenant on the part of such owner, lessee, sublessee, tenant, and/or subtenant, for themselves and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants, and subtenants, forever to hold and save the city of Sumner free and harmless from any and all claims, actions, or damages of every kind and description which may accrue to, or be suffered by, any persons by reason of the use of such public place, or of the construction, existence, maintenance, or use of such structure. If the application is for a permit to construct and maintain an areaway, such agreement shall also contain a covenant on the part of the persons or corporations executing the same, for themselves and their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, assigns, lessees, sublessees, tenants, and subtenants, assuming the duty of inspecting and maintaining all services, instrumentalities, and facilities installed in the areaway to be constructed or occupied under authority of such permit and assuming all liability for, and saving and holding the city of Sumner harmless from, any and all loss, damage, or injury that may result to his or their own person or property, or the person or property of another, by reason of such services, instrumentalities, or facilities. In addition, such agreement shall contain a provision that the permit is wholly of a temporary nature, that it vests no permanent right whatsoever, that upon a 30-day notice, posted on the premises, or by publication in the official newspaper of the city of Sumner, or without such notice, in case the permitted use shall become dangerous, or such structures shall become insecure or unsafe, or shall not be constructed, maintained, or used in accordance with the provisions of this title, the same may be revoked and the structure and obstructions ordered removed at the expense of the grantee of the permit. Every such agreement shall be retained by the department of public works and the city clerk. (Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.070 Revocation of permits.

All permits granted under the provisions of this chapter may, in any case, be revoked by the director of public works upon 30 days’ notice, or without notice in case any such use or occupation shall become dangerous or any structure or obstruction permitted shall become insecure or unsafe, or shall not be constructed, maintained, or used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. If any such structure, obstruction, use, or occupancy is not discontinued on notice to do so by the director of public works, the director of public works may forthwith remove such structure or obstruction from such place or make such repairs upon such structure or obstruction as may be necessary to render the same secure and safe, at the expense of the grantee of the permit or his successor, and such expense, together with the cost of its collection, may be collected in the manner provided by law. (Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.075 Fees.

An application fee of $200.00 shall be applied to each permit to cover staff review and processing costs. (Ord. 2272 § 1 (part), 2008)


12.70.080 Issuance of permits.

Upon approval by the director of public works of an application for the use or occupation of a public right-of-way, the department of public works shall issue a permit therefor.

The owners of an interest in any real estate abutting any city right-of-way, or any part thereof, may petition for the vacation of such city right-of-way, or any part thereof, by submitting an application, consistent with a form established by the city, to the city clerk along with a nonrefundable fee in the sum established by SMC 18.56.060.

Upon receipt of a complete application for the vacation of any city right-of-way or the passing of a resolution regarding the same, the council shall set a public hearing and provide notice pursuant to RCW 35.79.010 and 35.79.020. If, prior to the time of the hearing, 50 percent of the abutting property owners file a written objection to the proposed vacation with the city clerk, the council shall be prohibited from vacating the right-of-way. (Ord. 2706 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.80.050 Review for reservation of easement.

If, following a public hearing on the matter, the council determines to grant such petition, it shall review the necessity for a reservation of easements over said property, and if it shall determine that easements are required, it shall provide in the vacation ordinance for the reservation of an easement or easements or the right to exercise and grant easements in respect to the vacated land for the construction, repair and maintenance of public utilities and services. (Ord. 2706 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.80.060 Compensation for vacation.

A. If the council determines to grant a petition or any part thereof, the council may provide in the vacation ordinance that said ordinance shall not become effective until the owners of property abutting upon the street or alley, or part thereof so vacated, and in whom the title to said vacated street or alley shall vest, shall compensate the city for the vacated property in an amount established by council. If the property has been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, or if the property, or portions thereof, were acquired at public expense, the sum established by council shall not exceed the full appraised value of the area vacated. In all other instances, the sum established by council shall not exceed one-half the appraised value of the area vacated. The appraised value shall be determined upon the basis of an appraisal performed at the expense of the petitioner(s) and by an appraiser approved by the city. If the vacation ordinance requires payment as specified in this section, said payment shall be made to the city within 90 days after passage of the ordinance by the city or said ordinance shall become void.

B. Upon receipt of timely payment, the city shall, at its expense, record a certified copy of the ordinance with the county auditor’s office.

(Ord. 2706 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.80.070 Recipients of vacated right-of-way.

Upon vacation of any right-of-way, or portion thereof, the vacated property shall belong to the abutting property owners, one-half to each. However, if the city determines that the vacated right-of-way was dedicated entirely from one or more abutting parcels, title to the vacated property shall go to the owner of the parcel from which the right-of-way, or any vacated portion thereof, was dedicated. (Ord. 2706 § 1 (part), 2019)


12.80.080 Approval considerations.

In determining whether to vacate any public right-of-way under this chapter, the council shall consider the following: 

A. Whether the proposed vacation is within the interest of the public good either in terms of needed development or the best or most desirable use of the property, among other things. 

B. Whether the proposed vacation subject area is presently or in the future needed for locating public services, facilities, or utilities. 

C. Whether the vacation would prevent the extension of or the retention of public services, facilities, or utilities. 

D. Whether any existing public services, facilities, or utilities in the subject area can be relocated or replaced in an orderly and efficient manner in an alternate location. 

E. Whether the subject area is presently or in the future suitable for public non-motorized access between city blocks or neighborhoods; for a public park or access or public parking to serve a public park, trail or other public facilities; or for public access to educational and recreational opportunities at environmentally critical areas.

F. Whether the vacation will cause any parcel to be landlocked or will result in inadequate access to a right-of-way.

G. Whether the proposed vacation complies with SMC 12.80.090.

H. Whether the vacation would impede the future best use of the remainder of the property under the same ownership or any adjoining land; or adversely affect the development of the remainder land, or any adjoining land, or access thereto; and the vacation does not conflict with provisions of this land use code including the street connectivity standards and block lengths. (Ord. 2706 § 1 (part), 2019)

The city of Sumner shall conduct a rate study of each utility’s expenditures and needed revenues during each biennial budget process. The rate study shall be based on historical data, the capital facilities program, cost of proposed improvements to the wastewater treatment plant, operations and maintenance needs and debt service. In addition, the rate structure of all classifications of users will be reviewed for fairness for use of the facilities of the utility and is the basis of the rate structure contained in this chapter. (Ord. 2529 § 1 (part), 2015)


13.08.040 Accounting and charges – Change of ownership.

A. All utility accounts shall be kept in the name of the owner of the property when known and all charges shall be made against the property, as well as the owner thereof. No change of ownership or occupancy shall affect the application of this section.

B. The city will send all utility bills to the owner. Upon written application, the owner may have a duplicate bill sent to a tenant by having the utility account placed in his/her name; however, all charges shall be made against the property and the owner shall remain liable for all charges not paid by the tenant.

C. Upon written application by the owner, or the owner’s agent, a final bill can be created for a change in tenants or ownership. The fee for creating a final billing and related services for a property receiving city utilities shall be $40.00. This charge shall be placed on the final bill. (Ord. 2620 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2529 § 1 (part), 2015)


13.08.050 Billing adjustments due to water leaks.

A. To apply for a billing adjustment due to a water leak, a customer shall submit a written leak adjustment request form to the finance department. The request shall include the date the leak was repaired and copies of the repair bills or materials’ receipts. Upon receipt of the request, the public works department’s water division shall check the meter to ensure that the leak is fixed. After receiving confirmation that the leak has been fixed, the finance department shall analyze the utility account. If the water consumption for the same billing period in the previous year was greater than the consumption for the period in which the leak occurred, no adjustment will be made. If the water consumption for the same billing period in the previous year was less than the consumption for the period in which the leak occurred an adjustment will be processed. The difference between the current consumption and the previous consumption will be considered the leak. For new owners or renters occupying the premises for less than one year, the consumption used to determine the adjustment amount will be based on the average usage for that classification of customer for that time period in the previous year.

B. To ensure leaks are repaired in a timely manner the utility account will only receive an adjustment for half of the leak and the maximum number of months that will be adjusted is four. If the total dollar amount of the adjustment for both water and sewer is less than $25.00, the customer will not be eligible for an adjustment. The maximum number of billing adjustments as a result of leaks is one per calendar year unless there are unusual circumstances and the administrative services director or designee waives this requirement.

C. The monetary adjustment shall be made on the bill following the next meter reading cycle after the adjustment request is received. If necessary, an adjustment will also be made to the water consumption amount so that the winter sewer consumption average will be calculated based on the adjusted usage.

D. Payment of the bill that includes the leak is due on the date stated on the bill. If the customer is unable to pay the entire bill as a result of the leak, the customer shall pay the amount of the previous bill until the billing adjustment has been processed. If the customer pays the full amount of the previous bill by the due date stated on the current bill, the outstanding balance on the current bill will not be penalized and the service to that account will continue. Once the adjustment has been credited to the account, any amounts still owed will be due immediately. If the leak adjustment results in a credit balance on the account, refunds will not be given unless there has been a change of ownership or the credit balance will not be used up over a time period of three normal billings. (Ord. 2529 § 1 (part), 2015)


13.08.060 Payment of bills – Penalties.

A. The billing date is defined as the last day of the prior month. Bills for service are due and payable upon presentation, and payment may be made through the mail, in person at the city’s utility billing office, or online through the city of Sumner website.

B. Any monthly bill not paid within 20 days of the billing date or bimonthly bill not paid within 30 days of the billing date is delinquent. Failure of the mail service to deliver payment in a timely manner shall not be cause for waiver of penalties or for waiver of discontinuance of service as provided in this chapter.

C. Delinquent accounts shall be assessed a penalty of five percent of the total outstanding service balance, with a minimum penalty of $15.00, unless the past due balance is less than $35.00, in which case the penalty shall be waived. Penalty amounts will not compound. Failure to receive a bill will not be recognized as a valid excuse for failure to pay bills when due.

D. Upon request from the customer, the city may reverse one penalty per 12 months as a customer courtesy. Courtesy penalty reversals will only be granted to those customers who otherwise keep their accounts in good standing. Any additional reversals are authorized only if the penalty was due to a pending leak adjustment, change in ownership or otherwise approved by the chief financial officer. 

E. Any customer who has a delinquent account after 25 days shall have water service disconnected. Prior to disconnection a delinquent notice will be mailed to the service address and to the owner’s address if different. Failure to receive a disconnection notice will not be a valid excuse for avoiding disconnect. A lien may be placed upon the property being served by filing a notice with the city attorney. The city shall send a written notice of filing to the recorded owner of the property. The property owner shall be responsible for all fees associated with both filing and releasing the lien.

F. Partial payments shall be applied to the oldest charges, and remaining charges shall continue to accrue time and penalties. (Ord. 2679 § 1, 2019: Ord. 2620 § 1 (part), 2017: Ord. 2529 § 1 (part), 2015)

13.16.220 System development charges.

A. It is the policy of the city that all property owners seeking to connect to the city sewer system shall bear their equitable share of the cost of the general facilities of such system. Therefore, a system development charge may be paid either (1) upon the approval of a building (side) sewer permit application and prior to any construction, or (2) deferred according to subsection (D) of this section to the city at the city’s finance department. The cost of such system development charge shall be computed according to the following schedule:

1. The fee for connection to the city sewer system shall be assessed per equivalent residential unit (ERU) as defined in SMC 13.16.030. All commercial, institutional, and industrial users discharging domestic sewage shall pay the system development charge per ERU as defined in SMC 13.16.030 for the amount of sewage that would be discharged to the city sewer system at full use of the intended facility or building. The system development charge per ERU is specified in the following list. This list shall be used in determining the number of ERUs for the building unless the applicant has a minimum of three previous years of water meter records at their present location that would more accurately reflect the waste load generated by the facility. The city engineer may choose to use the data submitted rather than determining the number of ERUs from the list. All ERU calculations used to determine system development charges shall be carried to the nearest 0.01 ERU.

	Single-family residence	1.0	ERU per unit

	Multifamily residence	0.75	ERU per unit

	Accessory dwelling units	0.5	ERU

	Retail	1.25	ERU per 1,000 sq/ft of building

	Restaurant	0.14	ERU per occupant load

	Assembly	0.08	ERU per occupant load

	Office	0.8	ERU per 1,000 sq/ft of building

	Industrial domestic	0.1	ERU per 1,000 sq/ft of building

	High cubed warehouse	0.03	ERU per 1,000 sq/ft of building

	Mobile home park	1.0	ERU per space

	Motel	0.65	ERU per room

	Service station	4.0	ERU per pump

	Mini-mart	6.0	ERU per pump

Industrial waste loads shall pay a system development charge based on the number of ERUs as defined in SMC 13.16.030 (since industrial wastes are different in strength and composition). Four parameters in the definition of an ERU shall be weighted as follows in calculating the number: Flow, five-day BOD and TSS shall each be weighted at 0.3 and ammonia shall be weighted at 0.1.

2. Sixty-five percent of the fee shall be used for the treatment/disposal system upgrades.

3. Thirty-five percent of the fee shall be used for pump stations, force mains and sewer interceptor system upgrades.

B. Effective October 1st of each year, the system development charge shall be adjusted according to the Seattle Construction Cost Index (SCCI). The schedule of system development charges for the sewer is specified in the Sumner utility rate and fee schedule, as amended from time to time, available online and at City Hall.

C. The system development charges collected under this chapter shall be deposited in the utilities capital reserve fund and used only for utility system improvements.

D. Deferral of Payment of System Development Charges. An applicant for a building permit or site development permit may request a deferral of the full system development charge payment until final inspection or 18 months from the date of original permit issuance, whichever occurs first. Deferral of system development charges, and the application process for a deferral, shall be in accordance with the provisions and requirements of SMC 3.50.115(A)(1) through (11) as currently written or hereafter amended.

In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. (Ord. 2356 § 2 (part), 2011: Ord. 2077 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.440 Special agreements with industrial concerns.

No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. (Ord. 2356 § 2 (part), 2011: Ord. 2077 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.450 Sewer blockage.

The user and/or owner is responsible for keeping their side sewer clean and free of obstructions from the building to the main. When a backup occurs in the sewer, the customer shall first call the city shops and/or the public works department and ask that an operator be sent out to ascertain if the blockage is in the city-owned portion or the privately owned portion of the sewer.

If a customer is having backup problems on a regular basis, they may schedule a video inspection of the side sewer. The sewer department will schedule the work and perform the inspection within 15 working days after receiving the request, including the installation of a cleanout at the property line if needed and cleaning of the line. There is no charge for this work. If the inspection finds misalignment of joints and/or pipe or broken pipe, the property owner shall make repairs to the side sewer in a timely manner. If the broken or misaligned sewer is that portion owned by the city, the sewer department will make repairs within 20 working days. If the misaligned or broken sewer pipe is owned by the property owner, he shall file for a permit for sewer replacement as set forth in SMC 13.16.300 within 75 days and have the work completed within 120 days.

If a side sewer has no cleanouts for access, the sewer department will only install a cleanout to provide access during regular working hours unless the situation poses significant risk to property or public health. (Ord. 2356 § 2 (part), 2011: Ord. 2077 § 1 (part), 2004)


13.16.460 Authority to inspect.

(Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.020 Definitions.

For the purpose of this chapter, the words or phrases shall have the meanings as defined in SMC 13.16.030, Definitions. (Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)

13.20.040 Monthly sewer service rates.

The monthly rate for each property/building connected to the city’s sewer system, effective January 1, 2011, shall be as follows, unless otherwise required by this chapter:

A. Each single-family residence connected to the sewer system shall pay the minimum monthly rate plus the volume charge for each 100 cubic feet of water used each month above 500 cubic feet as measured by the water meter. Said rates and charges are presented in the Sumner utility rate and fee schedule available at City Hall and the city’s website. The monthly sewer consumption rate shall be based on the average winter usage using the months of mid-November through mid-May. The June billing will be based on this average winter usage and will remain the amount billed until the following June billing when it will be recalculated based on the previous six-month average.

B. Each multifamily building (e.g., duplexes, accessory dwelling units, multi-unit apartment buildings, etc.) connected to the sewer system shall pay the minimum monthly rate per each dwelling unit plus the volume charge for each 100 cubic feet of water used each month above 400 cubic feet times the number of dwelling units as measured by the water meter. The monthly sewer consumption rate shall be based on the average winter usage using the months of mid-November through mid-May. The June billing will be based on this average winter usage and will remain the amount billed until the following June billing when it will be recalculated based on the previous six-month average.

C. All nonresidential customers (commercial, industrial, institutional, etc.) connected to the sewer system shall pay the minimum monthly rate per each equivalent residential unit (ERU), as defined in SMC 13.16.030, assigned to it plus the volume charge for each 100 cubic feet of water used each month above 500 cubic feet times the number of ERUs as measured by the water meter. There will be no winter averaging for these customers.

D. Rates for sewer service outside the city limits shall be the rates for service within the city limits, plus an additional 25 percent.

E. Where a customer is connected to the sewer system but is connected to a water system not operated by the city of Sumner, the water system administrator shall deliver copies of billings or meter readings showing water consumption and the consumption period to the city of Sumner finance department at such intervals as to allow proper and timely billing by the city of Sumner for sewer charges as set forth herein.

F. If a single-family residential customer relocates to a new single-family house inside the city sewer service area, the previously established consumption average will be applied to the new address until the average is recalculated. A residential customer (either single-family or multifamily) who does not have three complete, consecutive bills at the time of recalculation of the consumption average will be assigned the system average of 700 cubic feet for their classification. Closing or partial bills will not be included in the calculation of the consumption average.

G. There will be no adjustments to residential sewer bills using the winter averaging for the intentional use of water such as irrigation, the filling of swimming pools, ponds, hot tubs or similar activities during the winter months of mid-November through mid-May when the averaging is determined. (Ord. 2529 § 2 (part), 2015: Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2333 § 1 (part), 2010: Ord. 2234 § 1, 2007; Ord. 2048 § 1, 2003: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.050 Customers not connected to the sewer system.

A. When a customer is not connected to the sewer system and has a working septic system, such customer will not be required to pay the monthly service charges. Until such time as the septic system fails and/or the Tacoma-Pierce County health department deems the septic system as environmentally unsound, then the customer shall be required to connect to the sewer system where it is accessible and follow associated connection procedures. A city sewer main located within 200 feet of the property is considered accessible. All costs for extension of the sewer main and installation of a side sewer shall be borne by the customer, except that the customer may request a latecomer agreement if there are adjacent property owners that may be benefited in the future and in accordance with the requirements of chapter 13.40 SMC.

B. Where a customer is served by a usable septic system and has a stub available such customer is not required to pay associated monthly service charges until such time as the septic system is unworkable or the Tacoma-Pierce County health department deems the septic system environmentally unsound. At such time the customer will be required to hook up to the city sewer system at the customer’s cost, pay applicable system development charges, permit fees and other fees in effect at the time of connection and pay the applicable monthly sewer service charges from that point forward. (Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2333 § 1 (part), 2010: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.060 Reserved.

Repealed by Ord. 2529. (Ord. 2479 § 1 (part), 2014; Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.070 Protest to rates and charges.

If any customer shall be dissatisfied with any sewer charge imposed, the customer may file a written protest with the administrative services director or designee setting forth their objections, provided such protest is filed within 15 days of receipt of the bill being protested. Upon receipt of any such protest, the city shall, within 15 days, make a determination in writing as to the correctness of the bill. (Ord. 2479 § 1 (part), 2014; Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.080 ERU adjustments.

A. Sewer service charges for all customers other than residential are based on ERUs. An ERU is defined as 200 gallons per day (gpd) as measured at the point of discharge from the building/facility of normal domestic sewage. The methodology set forth in chapter 13.16 SMC for calculating the number of ERUs for various types of building occupancy uses is based on this definition derived from studies of waste generated from similar facilities. The public works department has done a study and determined the number of ERUs for each customer. The determination of the number of ERUs for each customer is based on the intended use of the building/facility at full capacity. The public works department has planned, designed and constructed the necessary facilities to convey and treat this amount of waste. The sewer service rate structure set forth in this chapter acknowledges the fixed costs of the sewer system and the volume charge reflects the variable costs of operating that system.

B. Any customer who disputes the assigned number of ERUs for determining their monthly sewer service charge may request a reevaluation of their ERUs. The request shall be in writing and addressed to the public works director. Accompanying the request shall be payment to offset the labor costs to do the evaluation. The payment shall be $50.00 plus $10.00 for each ERU over five ERUs assigned to that account. The director or his or her designee shall prepare such evaluation and make a report in writing to the customer within 20 work days of the request. If an adjustment is appropriate, the public works director shall notify the administrative services director or designee and utilities clerk and direct them to make the changes. There will be no adjustment credits or debits for past charges due to any adjustment under this section. (Ord. 2479 § 1 (part), 2014; Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.090 Special requirements for industrial users.

A. Industrial firms, where the water used does not fully return to the sanitary sewer system, because it is incorporated into the product, evaporates or is used for wash water that is approved for discharge to some other location than the sanitary sewer system, shall meet with the public works director or his or her designee and mutually agree to an equitable method of determining the customer’s use of the city’s sewerage system. Said agreement shall be in writing and signed by both parties. The city shall file a copy with the customer’s account. The installation of extra water meters internally to measure only that portion of the water that returns to the sewer system or to deduct that portion not returned to the system or by using a flat rate of $3.50 per month per employee if no other means is available are methods that may be used as determined by the public works director.

B. Industrial firms, where all or a part of the consumption of water comes from privately owned wells or other sources, which discharge wastewater into the sanitary sewer shall, at their expense, meter such sources and make meter readings available to the sewer utilities clerk for the proper determination of sewer service charges.

C. Prior to discharging any industrial waste, other than normal domestic waste, by an industry, full analytical test reports of the constituents of the waste shall be submitted to the superintendent of the wastewater treatment facility (WWTF) for his determination whether they are compatible with the treatment process and whether the WWTF has capacity to treat the waste. The public works director, in consultation with the superintendent, shall determine if pretreatment is required and whether the city is willing to accept the waste. If the city determines that it can process the waste, the customer shall make application for the appropriate permits. In addition to permits to receive sewer service for industrial wastes, the customer shall submit an industrial user survey and enter into an industrial WWTF agreement with the city that will set forth the conditions of service, means of measurement and methodology for determining the amount due as well as determining the monthly service charges due that represent the fair share for use of the sanitary sewer system. (Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2333 § 1 (part), 2010: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.100 Discontinuance of service.

Any facility/building that is connected to the sanitary sewer system and is habitable, whether occupied or not, and regardless of whether the water service is on or off, shall pay the minimum monthly service charge as set forth herein. (Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)


13.20.110 Failure to pay.

Repealed by Ord. 2529. (Ord. 2356 § 3 (part), 2011: Ord. 2032 § 1 (part), 2002)

A. If, for reasons beyond its control, the city is unable to read the customer’s meter on the scheduled reading date, the city may bill the customer for estimated consumption during the billing period, subject to adjustment at the time the meter is next read. Water consumption will be estimated if one or more of the following conditions exist:

1. Severe weather;

2. Deposits of heavy snow or ice;

3. Vicious dog;

4. Some unusual circumstance which makes it impossible to read the meter, such as a vehicle parked over the meter box or construction.

B. Any facility/building that is connected to the water system and is habitable, whether occupied or not, and regardless of whether the water service is on or off, shall pay the minimum monthly service charge.

C. Each meter on a customer’s property will be considered separately, and the readings of two or more meters will not be combined.

D. The monthly service charge applicable to opening periods, closing bills and bills rendered for periods less than 30 days will be prorated. The measured amount of water actually served will not be prorated.

E. Protests to Rates and Charges and Meter Tests.

1. If any customer is dissatisfied with any water charge imposed, the customer may file a written protest with the utilities division setting forth the customer’s objections, provided such protest is filed within 15 days of receipt of the bill being protested.

2. Upon receipt of any such protest, the city shall within 15 days make a determination in writing as to the correctness of the bill.

3. If the customer is dissatisfied with the city’s decision, the customer may then file a written appeal to the city council; provided, such appeal is filed within 10 days of receipt of the city’s decision. A condition precedent to such appeal is the payment to the city of the amount of the disputed bill.

4. A customer may request that the city test the meter at the service address in question. The customer or his representative may be present at the time of the test which shall be set at the time and date mutually agreed upon. In any case, the test shall be performed within 10 days of the request. A report showing the results of the test will be developed within 15 days after completion of the test. Upon request, the city will mail a copy to the customer. At no point will the billing adjustments go back any further than six months.

a. Nonregistering Meters. When, upon a test, a meter is found to be nonregistering, the city may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was nonregistering for a period not exceeding three months at an estimate of the consumption based upon the customer’s prior use during the same season of the previous year or upon another customer of the same class. In all cases, if it is found that the error in a meter is due to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the overcharge or undercharge will be computed back to, but not beyond, such date.

13.32.010 Council findings of fact.

The city council finds as follows:

A. The city council has determined that storm drainage and surface water runoff within the city must be controlled in a manner that mitigates damage to property, erosion of soil, restriction of natural or manmade watercourses due to unrestricted sedimentation, and water quality impacts in receiving water bodies.

B. The funding for storm drainage and surface water control in the city needs to meet current and future needs to protect private and public property from damage caused by urban stormwater runoff.

C. The existing storm drainage and surface water runoff facilities must be adequately inspected, maintained, operated, and replaced through a funding program.

D. That the extent of impervious groundcover increasing the amount and rate of storm drainage or surface water runoff from a parcel of property is, therefore, the primary factor determining an individual property’s contribution to the flow rate and quantity of runoff from such property into the city’s storm drainage and surface water control system.

E. That all developed real property within the corporate boundaries of the city contributes runoff to the city’s stormwater drainage system and that all developed property benefits from the stormwater management efforts of the city and should participate financially in the payment of all expenses for administration, maintenance, operation, and improvement of such stormwater drainage system.

F. The city has retained Parametrix and their subconsultant Financial Consulting Solutions Group, Inc., to develop a financial and management analysis of storm drainage and surface water needs for the city, including evaluation of revenue sources to meet these needs. Their analysis is documented in the 2005 Stormwater Comprehensive Plan.

G. The city filed an application with the Washington State Department of Ecology for a Municipal Stormwater National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit as required by law in March 2003, and received a permit in February 2007. Under this permit, the utility is required to add programs, enhance some of the utility’s operations and maintenance functions, and perform additional actions as required for permit compliance.

H. The city requires the use of low impact development (LID) techniques for stormwater management as specified in chapter 13.48 SMC. By keeping the amount of effective impervious surface to a minimum, amending soils, and utilizing the natural absorption and cleansing abilities of the soil and vegetation to detain, retain and/or treat storm runoff, the use of LID strategies produces cleaner and cooler runoff water than is normally obtained using conventional treatment facilities and may provide for ground water recharge that is more representative of historic natural conditions.

I. Special districts exist within the corporate limits of the city. Special districts, formed for specific purposes other than the purposes of this chapter, have powers granted to them by laws of the state of Washington. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.32.020 Purpose.

A. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a funding methodology to provide financing for planning, development, management, operation, maintenance, use, annual inspections, and alteration of the storm drainage and surface water runoff system in the drainage basins of the city, as specified in and pursuant to chapters 35.67 and 39.34 RCW, and Article 11, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, grant cities the authority to establish stormwater utility rates in order to maintain their hydrologic balance, minimize property damage, promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, minimize water quality degradation by preventing siltation and erosion of the city’s waterways and pollutants from entering downstream water bodies, ensure the safety of city streets and rights-of-way, and increase educational and recreational opportunities. 

B. The amount of the service charge is established in chapter 13.36 SMC.

C. System development charges for the implementation of capital improvements are regulated under chapter 13.48 SMC. System development charges are separate from the service charges in chapter 13.36 SMC.

D. This chapter does not abrogate the right of any special district to establish and collect rates, fees, or assessments that are required to implement the purposes of the special district. Such rates, fees, or assessments are in addition to the fees established in this chapter. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)

The city elects to exercise all lawful powers necessary and appropriate to the construction, purchase, condemnation, acquisition, maintenance, management, operations, and regulation of the storm drainage and surface water runoff system, as defined in this chapter, including, without limitation, all lawful powers to fix, alter, regulate, and control the rate charges and conditions for the use thereof. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.32.080)


13.32.060 Administration.

A. The storm drainage utility created in this chapter shall be administered by the public works department in such a manner as the city council shall provide by ordinance, resolution, or directive.

B. The storm drainage utility shall define and prepare cost estimates associated with its creation, administration, operation and maintenance of the drainage program for the city and develop a specific system and structure of rates for review and approval by the city council. The storm drainage utility shall develop procedures and mechanisms for billing, collecting, and administrating of said service charges established under this chapter. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.32.090)


13.32.070 Disposition of funds.

All funds from the storm drainage utility shall be deposited to the storm drainage fund as specified in this chapter. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.32.100)


13.32.080 Rates.

A. The specific rates, charges and procedures for collection, administration, and disposition of revenues shall be established by the city council under a separate ordinance.

B. The rates identified in this chapter are independent of and in addition to any rates, fees, or assessments that may be charged by any special district. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.32.110)


13.32.090 Policy for service charges.

A. It shall be the city’s policy that the rate structure to be applied in establishing the amount of the service fee assessed against each parcel of developed real property within the city’s corporate limits shall be based upon the amount of impervious surface contained within each parcel of property as measured by the provisions of SMC 13.32.100, except for those properties exempt from charges as set forth in this section.

B. The following special categories of property are exempt from service charges:

1. City streets and pedestrian facilities within rights-of-way; parks and open space including golf courses and cemeteries;

2. All federally owned lands located within the corporate limits of the city;

3. All undeveloped parcels of land;

4. Agricultural land including farms, orchards, pasture and timberland. (Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.32.120)


13.32.100 Method of calculating service charges.

A. Each single-family residential parcel in the city is designated as a single ESU irrespective of the size of parcel or the amount of impervious or effective impervious area on such parcel, until such time as the parcel is segregated or the use of the land is modified to other than single-family.

B. Each multifamily dwelling unit in the city is designated as 0.8 ESU irrespective of the size of parcel or the amount of impervious or effective impervious area on such parcel beginning with duplex units and up in the number of units per building.

C. When more than one separate dwelling unit is located on a single parcel, the primary residence shall be designated as 1.0 ESU and each subsequent accessory dwelling unit shall be designated as 0.8 ESU, each.

D. The city shall measure the impervious surface or effective impervious surface of all “nonresidential” and “developed” parcels in the city except those exempt from this chapter as set forth in SMC 13.32.090. The rate will be calculated by multiplying the number of ESUs, charged at the time of permit issuance, times the residential base rate and adjusting for any applicable credit in accordance with SMC 13.36.060. Each developed, nonexempt parcel of property shall be deemed to contain a minimum of one ESU.

E. In accordance with the policy established in SMC 13.32.090 that the service charges shall be determined by the amount of impervious area contained on each parcel of real property, those properties remaining in an undeveloped condition are deemed not to make use of the services of the drainage system or of the facilities of the system beyond that used by such property in the natural state. Therefore, no service charge shall be imposed upon that real property within the boundaries of the city which is undeveloped. (Ord. 2520 § 2, 2015: Ord. 2356 § 7 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.32.130)

13.36.010 Council findings of fact.

The city council finds as follows:

A. That all real property in the city contributes runoff to the common drainage problem, and that all real property in the city will benefit from the storm drainage utility.

B. That the intensity of development on all parcels of real property, as measured by the square footage of impervious surface area, is an appropriate basis for determination of an individual parcel’s contribution to the problem of storm and surface water runoff.

C. That each owner of a parcel of real property within the city should pay for his or her share of the costs of constructing, operating, maintaining, repairing, improving, and replacing drainage facilities in proportion to the amount of runoff contributed to the drainage system beyond that which would occur if the parcel were in its natural state.

D. Special districts exist within the city’s corporate limits. Special districts, formed for specific purposes other than the purposes of this title, have powers granted to them by the laws of the state of Washington. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.020 Purpose.

A. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish the system and structure of rates to be used in applying the storm drainage utility service charge to all developed parcels within the city limits. The system development charge (SDC) related to new capital costs and programs is addressed in chapter 13.48 SMC.

B. This chapter does not abrogate the right of any special district to establish and collect rates, fees, or assessments that are required to implement the purposes of the special district. Such rates, fees or assessments are in addition to the fees established in this chapter. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.030 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the words or phrases used shall have the same meanings as those delineated in chapters 13.32 and 13.48 SMC. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.040 Review and approval of stormwater site plan.

All stormwater site plans prepared in connection with any of the permits and/or approvals required by the city shall be submitted for review and approval by the public works department. A fee shall be charged at the time of permit issuance. See SMC 13.48.325 for additional information regarding fees. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.050 System impacts – Developer contributions.

The city is authorized to require mitigation of the off-site impacts that development may have on its drainage system. Payment by the developer of an equitable pro rata portion of specific off-site drainage improvements which become necessary due to specific new development may be authorized. Such mitigation of off-site impacts shall be made in addition to any on-site control features required by the city. Off-site impacts may be identified during a downstream analysis performed for the stormwater site plan or projects identified in the current stormwater comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.060 Service charge imposed.

A. A storm drainage utility service charge is imposed on every parcel of land within the city, and the owner thereof, excepting only those properties identified as exemptions in chapter 13.32 SMC.

B. This charge is deemed reasonable and is necessary to fund construction, repair, replacement, operation, maintenance, inspection and improvement of all storm drainage and surface water management facilities, including the accumulation of reserves, the retirement of any debt, and NPDES permit compliance.

C. Excluding those properties exempted in chapter 13.32 SMC, all parcels of real property within city limits will be subject to a monthly stormwater service charge as identified in the Sumner utility rate and fee schedule. This charge includes both state business and occupation (B&O) tax and the city utility tax. 

1. Single-Family Residential. Monthly stormwater service charges for single-family residential will be calculated per SMC 13.32.100(A) and (C).

2. Multifamily Residential. Monthly stormwater service charges for multifamily residential will be calculated per SMC 13.32.100(B).

3. Other Parcels, Including Institutional, Commercial, and Industrially Developed Parcels. The monthly charges for all other parcels except those exemptions itemized in chapter 13.32 SMC shall be based on a uniform rate for each ESU charged at the time of permit issuance of developed property:

a. The following credits are given to developed nonresidential parcels that meet the following criteria. For any developed nonresidential parcels that qualify for more than one credit, the total credit shall be determined as follows. No more than two credits shall be granted.

	Base charge × (1 – credit #1) × (1 – credit #2)

i. Nonresidential parcels that have their own stormwater control and treatment facilities and own, operate, and maintain those facilities will receive a 40 percent credit off the total monthly billing. Parcel owners must have an executed and recorded stormwater maintenance agreement with the city, submit annual reports to the city as required by the agreement, and correct identified deficiencies by the date specified in the agreement in order to be eligible for this credit.

ii. Nonresidential parcels that are developed or retrofitted with low impact development (LID) facilities in accordance with city low impact development standards and honor the maintenance obligations and land use restrictions set forth in their LID agreement will receive a 50 percent credit off the total monthly billing.

iii. Nonresidential parcels and private storm systems serving any residential parcel having private outfalls will receive a 25 percent credit off the total monthly charge. “Private outfalls” are defined in chapter 13.48 SMC.

iv. Industrial parcels with a valid Washington State stormwater NPDES permit will receive a 50 percent credit off the total monthly charge. (Ord. 2586 § 1, 2016; Ord. 2520 § 3, 2015: Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2333 § 3, 2010; Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.070 Measurement of impervious surface.

Through aerial photography and surface feature evaluation processes the city has measured the number of square feet of impervious surface on all parcels other than residential parcels. These areas are used as the basis for fee calculation. Area calculations are subject to future updates based on as-built plans, aerial photography, and/or surface feature evaluation processes. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.080 Billing and collection.

A. Storm drainage utility rates for each parcel of real property within the city shall be computed on a monthly basis. The amount to be billed shall be included on the existing water/sewer bill as a separate line item. A

“stormwater only” statement will be sent to those property owners who are not city water, refuse, or sanitary sewer customers. All billings, collections, and delinquencies shall be handled in a manner consistent with this chapter and chapter 13.32 SMC, including the discontinuance of water service in the event where the amount remitted is less than the total of all utility service rates billed.

B. All moneys collected through this stormwater utility fee shall be deposited in the storm drainage fund as established in chapter 13.32 SMC. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.090 Adjustment of charge.

A. Any person who considers that charges applied to their parcel are inaccurate or otherwise disagrees with the determination may apply to the city’s public works department for a rate adjustment, stating, in writing, the grounds of the complaint. The public works department will review the case and report its findings to the city administrator for evaluation. The city administrator will consider the complaint and staff recommendations and determine whether an adjustment is necessary to provide for reasonable and equitable application of the storm drainage utility service charge.

B. For the purposes of this section, notice of determination shall be effective upon the date of mailing, postage prepaid to the address of the person seeking the determination. Notice of charges shall be the monthly account billing date; provided, that a reduction or increase in charges shall only be allowed from that billing date forward, for which an appeal is filed. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.100 Appeals – Filing requirements.

Appeals may be filed with the hearing examiner by any person aggrieved by a decision of the city administrator concerning the storm drainage utility charge. Such appeal shall be filed in writing in duplicate with the hearing examiner within 20 days from the action being appealed, together with a nonrefundable filing fee of $150.00. (Ord. 2356 § 8 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.36.110 Appeals – Hearing.

Article I. General Provisions


13.48.010 Title and authority.

A. These regulations shall be known as the city of Sumner “stormwater management regulations” and may be so cited.

B. The authority for the regulations contained in this chapter is based on RCW 35A.11.020.

C. The Storm Drainage Utility, chapter 13.32 SMC, was created and established pursuant to chapters 35A.80 and 35.67 RCW and Article 11 of the Washington State Constitution.

D. Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Authority. The city is authorized to develop and implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program for stormwater facilities in the city in accordance with the NPDES Phase II permit. (Ord. 2356 § 11 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.48.020 Purpose.

A. The purpose of these regulations is to: 

1. Protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with increased stormwater runoff and water quality degradation for all sites located within the city for which a permit from the city is required prior to land altering activities. Proper management of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property, reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion and sedimentation, assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards and reduce flooding.

2. Detect and eliminate illicit discharges.

3. Meet the requirements of the Western Washington Phase II municipal stormwater permit issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

4. Regulate all land-disturbing activity to control erosion associated with land-disturbing activities to prevent damage to public or private property and to prevent sedimentation of creeks, rivers, wetlands, and other water resources in the city.

5. Establish procedures through which these purposes can be fulfilled.

B. The provisions of these regulations shall apply to all development occurring within the incorporated area of the city. The application of these regulations and the provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute. The city shall be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of these regulations.

C. This chapter does not abrogate the technical standards established by any special district that have been developed for the construction and ongoing services provided by the facilities constructed by a special district. When differences in technical standards appear between the city and the special district, the standard that provides the greater protection of public health, resources and properties shall apply.

D. To meet the intent of the NPDES permit issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology of providing treated stormwater discharges to the river systems exempt from flow control and to meet the intent of other permit requirements, the city of Sumner requires that all applicants for residential, commercial, institutional and government agency projects implement low impact development (LID) strategies and practices in their stormwater site plan. LID standards and criteria are set forth in the manuals and the Sumner Development Specifications and Standard Details as therein referenced. The city engineer, or his or her designee, may waive LID strategies if he deems that this type of stormwater management is not applicable or feasible for a particular project. (Ord. 2356 § 11 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.48.030 Adopted.

A. The city of Sumner has adopted the 2012 Washington State Department of Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, as amended in December 2014, together with any amendments or corrections.

B. The city of Sumner has adopted Appendix 1, Minimum Technical Requirements for New Development and Redevelopment, of the 2013-2018 Western Washington Phase II municipal stormwater permit.

C. The city of Sumner has adopted the 2012 Puget Sound Partnership Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound together with any amendments or corrections.

D. The city of Sumner has adopted, together with any amendments or corrections, the city of Sumner Development Specifications and Standard Details.

E. Where there are discrepancies between these adopted references, the standard that provides the most environmental protection shall be used. (Ord. 2586 § 2 (part), 2016: Ord. 2356 § 11 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010)


13.48.040 Permit – When required – Phasing.

A. A site development permit is required for any proposed development, land-disturbing activity, stockpiling or application of sediment producing materials unless:

1. Otherwise exempt from a site development permit under SMC 13.48.050.

2. If the permittee applies for and is granted a variance by the city in accordance with SMC 13.48.070.

B. A stormwater site plan, approved by the city, is required for all projects for which a site development permit is required unless:

1. The proposed actions are exempt from a site development permit under SMC 13.48.050;

2. The city engineer waives the submission of the stormwater site plan in accordance with SMC 13.48.060; or

3. The permittee applies for and is granted a variance by the city in accordance with SMC 13.48.070.

C. The required permit or permits will not be issued for any activity on any parcel or lot until the stormwater site plan has been approved unless the project is exempt or a waiver or variance is granted by the city as identified in this chapter.

D. Permit requirements shall be determined by the city engineer based on the permittee’s proposed phasing and actions. The design, construction and operation and maintenance of temporary or permanent stormwater or surface water management facilities required for the permit shall be in accordance with these regulations and the standards adopted in SMC 13.48.030.

1. Additions or Modifications to Existing Single-Family Detached Residential Structures and Their Accessory Buildings. If the thresholds in the manual are exceeded, a stormwater site plan is required. Applicants for additions or modifications to single-family residential structures are still required to provide stormwater control for the additional impervious area created by the project by tight-lining flow from the downspouts to the stormwater collection system located in the right-of-way adjacent to the property frontage. If a stormwater collection system is not located within the right-of-way fronting the property, or if site conditions make it physically impossible to connect the downspouts to the stormwater collection system, stormwater control shall be constructed per the single-family residential infiltration system guide contained in the Sumner Development Specifications and Standard Details.

2. Projects That Will Construct a Single House on a Single Residential Lot That Is Not Part of a Short Subdivision or Subdivision. If the thresholds in the manual are exceeded, a stormwater site plan is required. If exempt from developing a stormwater site plan, applicants for single-family residential construction on a single residential lot shall still be required to provide stormwater control by tight-lining flow from the downspouts to the stormwater collection system located in the right-of-way adjacent to the property frontage. If a stormwater collection system is not located within the right-of-way fronting the property, or if site conditions make it physically impossible to connect the downspouts to the stormwater collection system, stormwater control shall be constructed per the single-family residential infiltration system guide contained in the Sumner Development Specifications and Standard Details.

E. For projects that have extended phasing:

1. Additional permit fees shall be required if the length of phasing exceeds the time length of the permit; and

2. Financial guarantees shall be extended to cover the proposed length of phasing. (Ord. 2356 § 11 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.48.032)


13.48.050 Permit – Exemptions.

A. A permittee receiving an exemption from the city to obtain a permit or prepare a stormwater site plan:

1. Is not authorized to cause illicit discharges, including spills, of oil or hazardous substances;

2. Is not relieved from responsibilities and liabilities under state and federal laws and regulations pertaining to those discharges; and

3. Is not authorized to allow discharges that would violate standards in the NPDES Phase II permit.

B. The following are exempt from obtaining a site development permit:

1. Commercial agriculture as exempt in accordance with the manual. Exempt commercial agricultural practices involving working the land for production are generally exempt from this chapter. However, the conversion from timberland to agriculture, and the construction of impervious surfaces, are not exempt.

2. Forest practices as exempt in accordance with the manual. Forest practices regulated under WAC Title 222, except for Class IV – General Forest Practices that are conversions from timberland to other uses, are exempt from this chapter.

The following road maintenance practices are exempt: pothole and square cut patching, overlaying existing asphalt or concrete pavement with asphalt or concrete without expanding the area of coverage, shoulder grading, reshaping/regrading drainage systems, crack sealing, resurfacing with in-kind material without expanding the road prism, and vegetation maintenance.

4. Any proposed land-disturbing activity, fill, or cut involving 50 cubic yards of earth or less.

C. Projects requiring a site development permit and/or stormwater site plan are exempt from flow control if there is a direct discharge to a water body identified in Appendix 1E of Volume I of the manual; provided, that all of the following conditions are met:

1. The permittee constructs the outfall;

2. The permittee utilizes an existing outfall, provided the permittee conducts hydraulic modeling and backwater analysis to verify that the existing outfall has sufficient capacity to convey the additional runoff volume and flow without surcharging;

3. A hydraulic project approval (HPA), if required, is applied for by the permittee and is issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; 

4. The outfall does not violate any stormwater diversions as documented in Appendix 1E of Volume I of the manual;

5. The permittee obtains all other permits required by federal, state and local laws and regulations; and

6. The permittee enters into an operations and maintenance agreement with the city. The operations and maintenance agreement may be waived; provided, that:

a. The outfall is permitted under Ecology’s industrial stormwater general permit or other individual permit that requires the ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the outfall by the permittee;

b. Copies of the Ecology-approved permit are submitted to the city; and

c. Copies of all reports are submitted to the city at the time of submittal to Ecology.

D. Projects exempt from a site development permit are exempt from preparing a stormwater site plan. (Ord. 2586 § 2 (part), 2016; Ord. 2356 § 11 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.48.034)


13.48.060 Waiver.

8. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health and welfare, nor injurious to other properties in the vicinity and/or downstream, and to the quality of waters of the state;

9. The variance is the least possible exception that could be granted to comply with the intent of the NPDES Phase II permit and the minimum requirements of the manual; and

10. Adherence to the minimum requirements outlined in the manual imposes a severe and unexpected economic hardship. To determine whether the application imposes a severe and unexpected economic hardship, the project applicant must consider and document the following before the city can grant written findings of fact:

a. The current (pre-project) use of the site;

b. How the application of the minimum requirement(s) restricts the proposed use of the site compared to the restrictions that existed prior to the adoption of the minimum requirements;

c. The possible remaining uses of the site if the variance was not granted;

d. The uses of the site that would have been allowed prior to the adoption of the minimum requirements;

e. A comparison of the estimated amount and percentage of value loss as a result of the minimum requirements versus the estimated amount and percentage of value loss as a result of requirements that existed prior to adoption of the minimum requirements;

f. The feasibility for the owner to alter the project to apply the minimum requirements.

C. Variances from the erosion and sediment control ordinance may be permitted only after determination by the city engineer or his or her designee employing the following criteria:

1. There are unique circumstances applicable to the subject property or to the intended use, such as topography, location or surroundings, which do not generally apply to other properties or classes of use;

2. Such a variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property or class of use;

3. The granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property, water quality, environment, habitat, or improvements in the vicinity;

4. The granting of such variance will not adversely affect any applicable comprehensive drainage or zoning plan;

5. The variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief. (Ord. 2356 § 11 (part), 2011: Ord. 2316 § 1 (part), 2010. Formerly 13.48.038)


13.48.080 Applicability to governmental entities.

B. The notice shall be served on the owner, tenant or other person responsible for the condition by personal service, registered mail or certified mail, with return receipt requested, addressed to the last-known address of such person. If, after a reasonable search and reasonable efforts are made to obtain service, the whereabouts of the person(s) is unknown or service cannot be accomplished and the code enforcement officer makes an affidavit to that effect, then service of the notice upon such person(s) may be made by:

1. Publishing the notice once each week for two consecutive weeks in the city’s official newspaper; and

2. Mailing a copy of the notice to each person named on the notice of violation by first-class mail to the last-known address, if known, or if unknown, to the address of the property involved in the proceedings.

C. If the person to whom it is directed cannot, after due diligence, be personally served within Pierce County and if an address for mailed service cannot, after due diligence, be ascertained, notice shall be served by posting a copy of the notice of civil violation conspicuously on the affected property or structure.

D. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit or preclude any action or proceeding pursuant to SMC 15.06.080, 15.06.090, 15.06.110 or 15.06.120.

E. The code enforcement officer may mail, or cause to be delivered to all residential and/or nonresidential rental units in the structure, a notice which informs each recipient or resident about the notice of violation, stop work order or emergency order and the applicable requirements and procedures.

F. A notice or order may be amended at any time in order to:

1. Correct clerical errors; or

2. Cite additional authority for a stated violation. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.060 Time to comply.

A. When calculating a reasonable time for compliance, the code enforcement officer shall consider the following criteria:

1. The type and degree of violation cited in the notice;

2. The stated intent, if any, of a responsible party to take steps to comply;

3. The procedural requirements for obtaining a permit to carry out the corrective action;

4. The complexity of the corrective action, including seasonal considerations, construction requirements and the legal prerogatives of landlords and tenants; and

5. Any other circumstances beyond the control of the responsible party.

B. Unless an appeal is filed with the city clerk for a hearing before the hearing examiner in accordance with SMC 15.06.100, the notice of violation shall become the final order of the code enforcement officer. A copy of the notice may be filed with the Pierce County auditor. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)

C. Collection of Monetary Penalty.

1. The monetary penalty constitutes a personal obligation of the person to whom the notice of civil violation is directed. Any monetary penalty assessed must be paid to the city within 10 calendar days from the date of service of the notice of violation. Service by mail shall be deemed complete upon the third day following the day upon which notice is placed in the mail, unless the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event service shall be deemed complete on the first day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday following the third day.

2. The city attorney is authorized to take appropriate action to collect the monetary penalty.

3. Use of Collection Agency. The city, at its discretion, may, pursuant to chapter 19.16 RCW, use a collection agency for the purposes of collecting penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter. The city shall add a reasonable fee, payable by the person responsible for the debt, to the outstanding debt for the collection agency fee incurred or to be incurred as a result of the use of the collection agency. No debt may be assigned to a collection agency until at least 30 days have elapsed from the time that the city attempts to notify the person responsible for the debt of the existence of the debt and that the debt may be assigned to a collection agency for collection if the debt is not paid. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.080 Stop work order.

In addition to any remedy provided for in this chapter, the code enforcement officer may issue a stop work order whenever a continuing violation of a regulation will materially impair the code enforcement officer’s ability to secure compliance, or when a continuing violation of the regulation threatens the health, safety, or welfare of any member of the public. The stop work order shall contain substantially the same information as required by SMC 15.06.050(A) and may be appended to, or incorporated by reference in, a notice of violation. Notice of the stop work order shall be deemed served upon posting of the notice as required by SMC 15.06.050(C), and shall be effective upon service. The violation of a stop work order shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term fixed by the court of not more than 90 days, or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of not more than $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.090 Stop use order.

In addition to any remedy provided for in this chapter, the code enforcement officer may issue a stop use order whenever a continuing violation of a regulation threatens the health, safety, or welfare of any member of the public. The stop use order shall contain substantially the same information as required by SMC 15.06.050(A), and may be appended to, or incorporated by reference in, a notice of violation. Notice of the stop use order shall be deemed served upon posting of the notice as required by SMC 15.06.050(C), and shall be effective upon service. The violation of a stop use order shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term fixed by the court of not more than 90 days, or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of not more than $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.095 Removal of stop work or stop use order – Misdemeanor.

The removal of a stop work order or stop use order posted in conformity with the requirements of this chapter without the authorization of the code enforcement officer or hearing examiner shall constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term fixed by the court of not more than 90 days, or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of not more than $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)


15.06.100 Review by the hearing examiner.

A. Any person significantly affected by or interested in a notice of violation issued by the code enforcement officer pursuant to SMC 15.06.050 may obtain an appeal of the notice by filing such appeal within the tenth calendar day following service of the notice. When the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday or a federal or city holiday, the period shall run until 5:00 p.m. on the next business day. The request shall be in writing, and upon receipt of the appeal request, the code enforcement officer shall forward the request to the office of the hearing examiner, pursuant to chapter 2.58 SMC. The filing of such an appeal shall not alter the time for compliance unless modified by the hearing examiner following a hearing. A stop work order issued pursuant to SMC 15.06.080 and a stop use order pursuant to SMC 15.06.090 may not be appealed to the hearing examiner. If an appeal was not filed within 10 calendar days after the notice of civil violation was issued, the violation shall be deemed committed and the monetary penalties shall be immediately due and subject to the collection procedures as detailed in SMC 15.06.070(C).

B. The hearing examiner shall schedule a hearing within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal. The hearing examiner shall provide at least 10 days’ notice to the applicant and code enforcement officer of the pending hearing. No public notice of the hearing is required.

C. Procedure. The hearing examiner shall conduct a hearing on the civil violation pursuant to any procedural rules or orders duly issued by the examiner. The applicable code enforcement officer, department director, and the person to whom the notice of civil violation was directed may participate as parties in the hearing and each party may call witnesses. The determination of the applicable code enforcement officer and/or department director as to the need for the required corrective action shall be accorded substantial weight by the code compliance hearing examiner in determining the reasonableness of the required corrective action; however, where a person has previously been found to have committed the same violation, issuance of a notice of violation alleging the same offense shall constitute prima facie evidence of the new violation and create a rebuttable presumption of having committed the new violation. In addition, other chapters of the code may allow a rebuttable presumption in favor of the city in specific circumstances.

D. Decision of the Hearing Examiner.

1. The hearing examiner shall determine whether the city has established by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred and that the required correction is reasonable and shall affirm, vacate, or modify the city’s decisions regarding the alleged violation and/or the required corrective action, with or without written conditions.

2. The hearing examiner shall issue an order to the person responsible for the violation which contains the following information:

a. The decision regarding the alleged violation including findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision;

b. The required corrective action;

c. The date and time by which the correction must be completed;

d. The monetary penalties assessed based on the provisions of this chapter;

e. The date and time after which the city may proceed with abatement of the unlawful condition if the required correction is not completed.

3. Assessment of Monetary Penalty. Monetary penalties assessed by the hearing examiner shall be in accordance with the monetary penalty schedule in SMC 15.06.070.

a. The hearing examiner shall have the following options in assessing monetary penalties:

i. Assess monetary penalties beginning on the date the notice of civil violation was issued and thereafter; or

ii. Assess monetary penalties beginning on the correction date set by the applicable department director or an alternate correction date set by the code compliance hearing examiner and thereafter; or

iii. Assess no monetary penalties; provided, however, if the hearing examiner finds that a violation has occurred, the mandatory minimum penalty shall be $500.00.

b. In determining the monetary penalty assessment, the hearing examiner shall consider the following factors:

i. Whether the person responded to staff attempts to contact the person and cooperated with efforts to correct the violation;

ii. Whether the person failed to appear at the hearing;

iii. Whether the violation was a repeat violation;

iv. Whether the person showed due diligence or substantial progress in correcting the violation;

v. Whether a genuine code interpretation issue exists; and

vi. Any other relevant factors.

c. The hearing examiner may double the monetary penalty schedule if the violation was a repeat violation.

d. Where action to abate the violation is required, the court shall give substantial weight to the city’s determination regarding the nature of any such action required, and whether such action has been satisfactorily performed.

4. Notice of Decision. The hearing examiner shall mail a copy of the decision to the appellant and to the applicable department director within 15 working days of the hearing.

5. Failure to Appear. If the person to whom the notice of civil violation was issued fails to appear at the scheduled hearing, the hearing examiner may enter an order finding that the violation occurred and assessing the appropriate monetary penalty. The city will carry out the hearing examiner’s order and recover all related expenses, plus the cost of the hearing and any monetary penalty from that person.

6. Monetary Penalty. The monetary penalty for a violation does not accrue pending the appeal; however, the code compliance hearing examiner may impose a daily monetary penalty from the date of service of the notice of civil violation if the code compliance hearing examiner finds that the appeal is frivolous or intended solely to delay compliance.

7. Use of Collection Agency. The city, at its discretion, may, pursuant to chapter 19.16 RCW, use a collection agency for the purposes of collecting penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter. The city shall add a reasonable fee, payable by the person responsible for the debt, to the outstanding debt for the collection agency fee incurred or to be incurred as a result of the use of the collection agency. No debt may be assigned to a collection agency until at least 30 days have elapsed from the time that the city attempts to notify the person responsible for the debt of the existence of the debt and that the debt may be assigned to a collection agency for collection if the debt is not paid.

8. Continued Duty to Correct. Payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve the person responsible for the violation of the duty to correct the violation.

9. Appeal to Superior Court – Land Use Decision. Judicial review of a land use decision, as defined in RCW 36.70C.020, made by the hearing examiner must be made pursuant to the provisions of the Land Use Petition Act, chapter 36.70C RCW. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.110 Subsequent repeat violation – Failure to abate – Misdemeanor.

The commission of a subsequent violation or the failure or refusal to abate a violation pursuant to an order of the hearing examiner after receipt of written notice of such order shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term fixed by the court of not more than 90 days or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of not more than $1,000 or by both such imprisonment and fine. The city attorney, or his or her designee, shall, at his or her discretion, have authority to file a subsequent violation as either a civil violation pursuant to this chapter or a misdemeanor. All misdemeanor charges filed under this section shall be filed with the Sumner municipal court and shall bear the signature of the Sumner city attorney or his or her designee. When the city files a criminal offense pursuant to this section, it shall have the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the violation occurred. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.120 Summary abatement.

Whenever a violation of a regulation causes a condition that poses an immediate or imminent threat to the safety of persons, property, or significant environmental damage, the city shall, upon the advice of the city attorney, take emergency action to abate the condition without requiring prior notice to public or private persons whose property may be affected by the city’s actions. Such emergency action may involve entry onto private property. However, notice of abatement action, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation, as well as any other party requesting such information, as soon as reasonably possible after the condition creating the emergency has been abated. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1781 § 1 (part), 1996)


15.06.130 Recovery of costs for abatement.

A. All costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting the violation shall be billed to the person responsible for the violation and/or the owner, lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use, and/or occupy the property; owners and tenants shall be jointly and severally liable, except where prohibited by law.

B. Costs of abatement shall become due and payable to the city within 30 calendar days from the date abatement begins. The city attorney may, at their discretion, allow a payment schedule or negotiate a reduced settlement when such a settlement is in the best interests of justice or the city’s budgetary needs.

C. The city may request, and the court may require, that the costs of abatement be ordered as restitution in any legal proceeding resulting from a notice of violation being issued against a person.

D. Recoverable “incidental expenses” shall include, but not be limited to, personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney’s fees; costs incurred in documenting the violation; hauling, storage, and disposal expenses; and actual expenses and costs of the city in preparing notices, specifications, and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and inspecting the work; and the costs of any required printing and mailing. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)


15.06.140 Interfering with abatement.

No person shall obstruct, impede, or interfere with the city or its agents who are lawfully engaged in abating a violation. Agents of the city shall include any person who holds an interest in the property at issue, when that person is lawfully engaged in abating a violation. Intentional violations of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor; violations occurring without intent shall constitute a civil violation. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)


15.06.150 Additional enforcement procedures.

The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive, and may be used in addition to other enforcement provisions authorized by the Sumner Municipal Code except as precluded by law. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)


15.06.160 Conflicts.

In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other provision of the Sumner Municipal Code or city ordinance providing for a civil penalty, this chapter shall control. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)


15.06.170 Meaning of terms.

For the purposes of this code, whenever “civil violation” and “civil penalty” are used in any code, ordinance or regulation of the city, these terms shall be deemed to have the same meaning as the terms “civil violation” and “monetary penalty,” respectively, as used herein. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)


15.06.180 Severability – Construction.

A. If a section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter is declared unconstitutional or invalid for any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter.

B. If the provisions of this chapter are found to be inconsistent with other provisions of the Sumner Municipal Code, this chapter is deemed to control. (Ord. 2261 § 1 (part), 2008)

Where a permit involves only an addition or remodel of a single-family dwelling or single-family accessory structure, where said work is valued at $7,500 or less, the building official may waive the plan review fee.

Plan review fees specified in this section are separate fees from the permit fees specified herein and are in addition to the permit fees.

15.14.010 Purpose and findings.

The city council of the city of Sumner finds that unkempt, unsafe, unsanitary and otherwise improperly maintained premises and structures, sidewalks and easements within the city of Sumner, in addition to the obvious hazards which these conditions pose to the public health, safety and welfare, adversely affect the value, utility and habitability of property within the city as a whole and specifically cause substantial damage to adjoining and nearby property. A property that is merely unkempt may reduce the value of adjoining property and there are sufficient properties that are unkempt, unsightly and dangerous, that the habitability and economic well-being of the city are materially and adversely affected. This chapter conveys to the city administration, in accord with the procedures set out below, all necessary and proper powers to abate nuisances as they are described or found to exist and to charge the costs of their abatement to those responsible, the owners and occupants of the property upon which nuisances exist, and those properties themselves. This chapter is an exercise of the city’s police power, and it shall be liberally construed to affect this purpose. (Ord. 1923 § 1, 2000)


15.14.020 Definitions.

Length of time or any particular state of mind of the owner or person entitled to possession is not conclusive in determining that property is abandoned.

B. “Board” means the Sumner improvement board and shall consist of the members of the city of Sumner design commission as defined by chapter 2.89 SMC.

C. “Boarded-up building” means any building the exterior openings of which are closed by extrinsic devices or some other manner designed or calculated to be permanent, giving to the building the appearance of non-occupancy or non-use for an indefinite period of time.

4. Uncleanliness or whatever is dangerous to human life or detrimental to health;

5. Overcrowding; or 

6. Abandonment or vacancy.

I. “Owner” means any person having any interest in the real estate in question as shown upon the records of the office of the Pierce County auditor, or who establishes his interest before the director, board, or hearing examiner. For the purpose of giving notice, the term “owner” also includes any person in physical possession.

J. “Person” means natural person, joint venture, joint stock company, partnership, association, club, company, corporation, business trust, organization, or the manager, lessee, agent, servant, officer or employee of any of them.

K. “Repeat violation” means a violation of the same regulation in any location by the same person for which voluntary compliance has been sought within two years, or a notice of violation has been issued within two years. (Ord. 2439 § 13, 2013; Ord. 1923 § 2, 2000)


15.14.030 Duties of the director.

The director is the chief administrative officer for the purposes of this chapter, and his or her duties and powers include:

A. Investigation of all buildings and premises which he has reasonable grounds to believe may be unfit, substandard, boarded-up, or a nuisance;

B. Preparation, service and posting of complaints against buildings or premises believed to be in violation; and

C. Doing all things necessary and proper to carry out and enforce this chapter. (Ord. 1923 § 3, 2000)


15.14.040 Duties and qualification of the board.

A. At least two members of the board should have knowledge of or be familiar with construction principals;

B. Conducting administrative hearings and rendering decisions based upon written findings; and

15.14.050 Unfit buildings.

A. In reaching a judgment that a building is unfit for human habitation, the director, board or the hearing examiner shall consider: 

1. Dilapidation;

2. Disrepair;

3. Structural defects;

4. Defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities, such as parts standing or attached in such manner as to be likely to fall and cause damage or injury;

6. Uncleanliness;

7. Inadequate light;

8. Inadequate sanitary facilities;

9. Inadequate drainage;

10. Substandard conditions.

B. If these or other conditions are found to exist to an extent dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the building’s occupants, or the occupants of neighboring buildings or of other residents of the city of Sumner, and if:

1. Structural deterioration is of such degree that:

a. Vertical members list, lean or buckle to the extent that a plumb line passing through the center of gravity falls outside the middle third of its base; or

b. Thirty-three percent of the supporting members shows damage or deterioration; or

2. The cost of restoration exceeds 60 percent of the value of the building; or

3. The building has been damaged by fire or other calamity, the cost of restoration exceeds 30 percent of the value of the building and it has remained vacant for six months or more. (Value shall be determined by reference to a current edition of “Building Valuation Data” published by the International Conference of Building Officials or, if not published, as determined by the director. Cost of restoration is the actual estimated cost, which may be determined in the same manner as “value.”) The board or the hearing examiner shall order the building or premises demolished and the land suitably filled and cleared, or shall order the property immediately vacated and secured as completely as possible pending demolition.

C. An undertaking entered into, at or prior to the hearing, by a party in interest creates a presumption that the building or premises can be reasonably repaired.   The failure to accomplish such an undertaking is grounds for the board or the hearing examiner to order demolition. If by reason of any of the above conditions, a building is unfit, but no public necessity is found for its immediate demolition, the hearing examiner, board or the director may take other action, such as causing the property to be cleaned, cleared, vacated, secured or otherwise repaired, which will promote the public health, safety or general welfare. (Ord. 1923 § 5, 2000)


15.14.060 Substandard buildings.

A. In reaching a judgment that a building or premises is substandard, the director, board and the hearing examiner shall be guided by such factors as:

1. Structural unsoundness;

2. Improper sanitation;

4. Improper weatherproofing; 

5. Defective or hazardous wiring, including wiring which:

c. Is not being used in a safe manner; 

6. Defective or hazardous plumbing, including plumbing which:

8. Fire hazard, including any building, device, apparatus, equipment, combustible waste or debris, or vegetation which may cause fire or explosion or provide ready fuel to augment the spread or intensity thereof; 

9. Nuisance.

B. If these or similar conditions are found to exist, the board or hearing examiner shall order the building or premises repaired, cleaned, cleared or otherwise brought into compliance with current codes, and may order the property vacated and secured as completely as possible pending such repair or other action. (Ord. 1923 § 6, 2000)


15.14.070 Nuisances.

A. In determining that a nuisance exists, the director, board and the hearing examiner will consider whether the conditions: 

1. Annoy, injure or endanger the comfort, repose, health or safety of others; 

2. Offend decency; 

3. Offend the senses;

4. Unlawfully interfere, obstruct, tend to obstruct or endanger the passage of any stream, park, parkway, square, street, sidewalk, easement or way;

15.14.080 Complaint.

If, after a preliminary investigation of any building or premises, the director finds that it is unfit, substandard, boarded-up, required to be boarded-up, or a nuisance; he or she shall cause the owners to be served, either personally or by first class and certified mail, with return receipt requested, and shall post in a conspicuous place on such property, a complaint stating in what respect such building is unfit for human habitation or other use or is substandard or that it is or should be a boarded-up building or that the premises is a nuisance, together with the corrective action to be taken and the fees and costs to be paid. If the whereabouts of such person is unknown and cannot be ascertained by the director in the exercise of reasonable diligence, he or she shall make an affidavit to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such persons may be made either by personal service or by mailing a copy of the notice and orders by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to each person at the address appearing on the last equalized tax assessment roll of the county where the property is located, or at the address known to the county assessor. A copy of the notice and order shall also be mailed, addressed to each person, at the address of the building involved in the proceedings, if different, and to each person or party having a recorded right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property. Such complaint shall contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the board at a place therein fixed, not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the service of such complaint; that all parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint, and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint. A copy of such complaint shall also be filed with the auditor of Pierce County, and such filing of the complaint or order shall have the force and effect of lis pendens. (Ord. 1923 § 9, 2000)

3. A description of the violation and a reference to the provisions of this code or other regulation that has been violated;

4. The corrective action to be taken, and a date and time by which the corrective action must be completed;

5. An agreement by the owner that the city of Sumner may abate the violation and recover its costs and expenses pursuant to this chapter if all terms of the voluntary agreement are not met;

15.14.100 Hearings before the board.

A. Unless, prior to the time fixed for hearing in the complaint issued by the director, arrangements satisfactory to the director for the repair, demolition, vacation or re-occupancy of the building or premises are made, including the proper application for permits, or abatement of the nuisance, the board shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining the immediate disposition of the building or premises. The hearing will be canceled if the director approves the completed corrective action at least 48 hours before the scheduled hearing.

B. The Board shall conduct a hearing pursuant to its adopted rules. The director or his or her designee and the owner may participate as parties in the hearing and each party may call witnesses. Any complainant or person affected by the violation may appear and present evidence. The city shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of evidence that a violation has occurred and that the required corrective action is reasonable. The determination of the director shall be accorded substantial weight. If the owner fails to appear at the scheduled hearing, the board will enter an order finding that the violation occurred and assess the appropriate costs.

C. The board shall issue an order to the owner that contains the following information:

1. The decision regarding the alleged violation including findings of fact and conclusions based thereon. 

2. The required corrective action.

3. The date and time by which the correction must be completed. 

4. The costs assessed.

5. The date and time after which the city may proceed with abatement of the unlawful condition if the required correction is not completed.

6. The decision shall state that the owner has the right to appeal to the hearing examiner within 30 days and, unless he does appeal or comply with the order, the city shall have the power, without further notice or proceedings, to vacate and secure the building or premises and do any act required of the owner in the order of the board, and to charge any expenses incurred thereby to the owner and assess them against the property.

D. The director shall mail by certified mail, a copy of the decision to the owner or occupant within 10 working days following the hearing.

E. If no appeal is filed, a copy of such order shall be filed with the auditor of Pierce County and shall be a final order. (Ord. 1923 § 11, 2000)


15.14.110 Hearings before the hearing examiner.

A. The purpose of the hearing examiner under this chapter is to review the proceedings and orders of the board and to affirm, modify or vacate said orders.

B. Within 30 days from the date of service and posting of an order of the board, an owner may file an appeal with the hearing examiner by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk setting out the reasons he believes the findings or order of the director to be erroneous. There will be not less than 10 or more than 30 days from the date of said appeal or referral and the hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be made in accord with SMC 15.14.080. The matter of the appeal will be scheduled for public hearing before the hearing examiner so as to allow 10 days’ notice of the hearing to the appellant and all interested parties and to permit final decision thereon to be made within 60 days after the filing of the appeal. The filing of the notice of appeal shall stay the order of the board, except so much thereof as requires temporary measures, such as securing of the building to minimize any emergent danger to the public health or safety.

C. Upon the public hearing of the appeal, the hearing examiner shall consider the file of the proceedings before the board and such other evidence as may be presented. After the hearing, the examiner may affirm, modify or vacate the order of the board, or may continue the matter for further deliberation or presentation of additional evidence. Normally the hearing examiner will not accept new evidence or evidence not made available to the board in the absence of good cause. The examiner’s review is on the record, not de novo. A record of the proceedings shall be made and kept for one year or until the matter is final, whichever is longer. The examiner shall cause its findings of fact and order to be made in writing; provided, he may adopt the findings and order of the board, or so much thereof as supports its decision. Such findings and order shall be served and posted in the same manner as an order of the board. In addition, such notice shall state that the owner has the right to petition the superior court of Pierce County for appropriate relief within 30 days after the order becomes final.

D. Any action taken by the hearing examiner shall be final 60 days after the filing of a notice of appeal unless continued with consent of the owner or occupant. In the event that the examiner fails to reach a decision or continues the hearing beyond 60 days after the filing of an appeal, the board’s order and finding shall be that of the examiner’s, and shall be final and subject to petition to the superior court; provided, any continuance at the request or with the consent of any owner or occupant shall suspend the running of the 60 days allowed for final decision, for the length of the continuance. (Ord. 1923 § 12, 2000)


15.14.120 Enforcement.

A. The order of the board or the hearing examiner may prescribe times within which demolition shall be commenced or completed. If the action is not commenced or completed within the prescribed time, or if no time is prescribed within the time for appeal, the director may cause the building to be demolished and the premises to be suitably filled and cleared as provided by SMC 15.14.050. If satisfactory progress has been made and sufficient evidence is presented that the work will be completed within a reasonable time, the board or the examiner may extend the time for completion of the work. If satisfactory or substantial progress has not been made, the board or the examiner may cause the building to be demolished and the premises suitably filled and cleared as provided by SMC 15.14.050. The director shall let bids for any demolition in accordance with SMC 15.14.130.

B. If other action ordered by the board or the hearing examiner is not taken within the time prescribed, or if no time is specified within the time for appeal, the director may cause the action to be taken by the city.

C. If the director deems it necessary to have the building secured as an interim measure for the protection of the public health and welfare while pending action, he may so order.   If the owner is unable or unwilling to secure the building within 48 hours, the director may order the building secured by the city.

D. If the owner is unable to comply with the board or hearing examiner’s order within the time required, and the time for appeals to the examiner or petition to the court has passed, he may, for good and sufficient cause beyond his control, request in writing an extension of time. The board or the hearing examiner may grant a reasonable extension of time after a finding that the delay was beyond the control of the owners. There shall be no appeal or petition from the board or the hearing examiner’s ruling on an extension of time. (Ord. 1923 § 13, 2000)


15.14.130 Costs.

A.    1. The costs of abatement, repair, alteration or improvement, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition, when borne by the city, shall be assessed against the real property upon which such costs were incurred unless paid. The director shall forward such costs to the city treasurer, who shall certify them to the county auditor for assessment on the tax rolls.

2. Bids for demolition shall be let only to a licensed contractor. The contract documents shall provide that the value of the materials and other salvage of the property shall be credited against the costs of the demolition. The contract documents may require bidders to estimate the salvage value of the property and, by claiming the salvage, reduce the amount of his bid accordingly. The contract price fixed by acceptance of such a bid shall not be adjusted to reflect the actual salvage value. Such bids may be let prior to the time for compliance or appeal, but shall not be binding or accepted until the order for demolition is final. The director shall have the authority to sign the contract on behalf of the city.

3. There shall be charged against the owner and assessed against the property of any boarded-up building an annual inspection fee of $250.00. Such fee shall be payable at the time the building becomes a boarded-up building. The hearing examiner or board shall order a refund of the proportional amount not due if the building is reoccupied or demolished. Subsequent annual fees shall be payable on or before the time the preceding annual fee has been exhausted.

B.    1. Actual costs and expenses will be assessed in accord with the provisions of this section.

2. In addition to actual abatement costs, the following administrative fees shall be assessed and collected in the same manner:

a. Where abatement is accomplished prior to board hearing: 

Nuisance, $100.00;

Substandard building, $200.00;

Unfit building, $300.00.

Provided, the director may waive these fees for a first offense if abatement is complete 48 hours prior to a board hearing; provided further, that where abatement is accomplished by voluntary agreement, the director shall charge at least $50.00 per month per acre or fractions thereof.

b. Where abatement is accomplished subsequent to or less than 48 hours prior to a board hearing:

Nuisance, $500.00;

Substandard building, $1,000;

Unfit building, $1,500.

c. Where abatement is accomplished following breach of an agreement or understanding between a property owner and director, board, or hearing examiner:

Nuisance, $1,000;

Substandard building, $2,000;

Unfit building, $3,000.

d. Where the abatement is accomplished by the city following hearing or default of the property owner:

Nuisance, $1,000;

Substandard building, $2,000;

Unfit building, $3,000.

3. For cases heard by the board of appeals add $500.00.

4. For repeat violations, costs shall be doubled.

C. The director, board, or hearing examiner may modify the time or methods of payment of such expenses as the condition of the property and the circumstances of the owner may warrant. In setting costs, they may reduce the costs to an owner who has acted in good faith and would suffer extreme financial hardship. They may increase costs if it appears that the scheduled costs are inadequate to make the city whole with respect to a particular violation. (Ord. 1923 § 14, 2000)


15.14.140 Unfit building and nuisance abatement fund.

A fund shall be created to retain the moneys collected pursuant to this chapter and pay for any demolitions and nuisance abatements undertaken by the city. (Ord. 1923 § 15, 2000)

15.52.010 Statutory authority.

The Legislature of the state of Washington has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. (Ord. 1406 § 1.1, 1987)


15.52.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of the city of Sumner are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 1768 § 1, 1996: Ord. 1406 § 1.2, 1987)


15.52.030 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 1406 § 1.3, 1987)


15.52.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;

B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 1406 § 1.4, 1987)


15.52.050 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

A. “Appeal” means a request for a review of the interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

B. “Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet flow and AH indicates ponding.

C. “Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the Flood Insurance Rate Map, zone A usually is refined into zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term “special flood hazard area” is synonymous in meaning with the phrase “area of special flood hazard.”

D. “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

E. “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

F. “Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system.

G. “Coastal high hazard area” means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources.

15.52.060 Applicability.

This chapter applies to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. (Ord. 1406 § 3.1, 1987)


15.52.070 Map adopted by reference.

The areas of special flood hazard are identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Pierce County including the City of Sumner, Community Number 530147,” dated March 7, 2017, which, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and any revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and the FIRM are on file at the city of Sumner, 1104 Maple Street, Sumner, Washington 98390. Where the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, and floodway maps do not provide adequate, best, or most recent information, the city of Sumner may utilize flood information that is more restrictive or detailed than the FEMA data which can be used for identifying flood hazard areas. The city may utilize the following sources of flood hazard data for floodplain boundaries, regulatory floodway boundaries, base flood elevations or cross sections when determining a flood hazard area:

A. Flood Insurance Rate Maps;

B. Flood Insurance Studies;

C. Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps;

D. Preliminary Flood Insurance Studies;

E. Letter of map amendments;

F. Letter of map revisions;

G. Historical flood hazard information; and

H. Any other available data that accurately classifies and delineates the flood hazard area or base flood elevation and has been prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or any other qualified person or agency with expertise. (Ord. 2596S § 2, 2017: Ord. 2596 § 2, 2017: Ord. 1406 § 3.2, 1987)


15.52.080 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 1406 § 3.3, 1987)


15.52.090 Interpretation.

In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

A. Considered as minimum requirements;

B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 1406 § 3.4, 1987)

(Ord. 1447 § 1, 1989; Ord. 1406 § 5.2-2, 1987)


15.52.240 Manufactured homes.

A. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones A1-A30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM on sites:

1. Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;

2. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

3. In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

4. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood;

shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least one foot above base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

B. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM that are not subject to the above manufactured home provisions be elevated so that either:

1. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation; or

2. The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement. At a minimum, a “reinforced pier” would have a footing adequate to support the weight of the manufactured home under saturated soil conditions such as occur during a flood. In addition, if stacked concrete blocks are used, vertical steel reinforcing rods should be placed in the hollows of the blocks and those hollows filled with concrete or high strength mortar. In areas subject to high velocity floodwaters and debris impact, cast-in-place reinforced concrete piers may be appropriate. (Ord. 2396 § 2, 2012: Ord. 1768 § 6, 1996: Ord. 1447 § 2, 1989: Ord. 1406 § 5.2-3, 1987)

15.52.250 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in SMC 15.52.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

1. Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

2. Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

a. Before the repair, reconstruction or improvement is started, or

b. If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the 50 percent.

C. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of SMC 15.52.210. (Ord. 1447 § 3, 1989: Ord. 1406 § 5.3, 1987)


15.52.251 Standards for shallow flooding areas (AO zones).

Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

A. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest grade adjacent to the building, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).

B. New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either:

1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as in SMC 15.52.230(A)(3).

C. Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

D. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO zones on the community’s FIRM shall either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

15.52.252 Coastal high hazard areas.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in SMC 15.52.070 are coastal high hazard areas, designated as zones V1-V30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

A. All new construction and substantial improvements in zones V1-V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

1. The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level; and

2. The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

B. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsections E1 and 2 of this section.

C. Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in zones V1-V30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The local administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.

D. All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of the mean high tide.

E. Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 or no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

2. The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

F. If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

G. Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings.

H. Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage.

I. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within zones V1-V30, V, and VE on the community’s FIRM on sites:

1. Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;

2. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

3. In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or

4. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a flood;

meet the standards of subsections A through H of this section and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones V1-V30, V, and VE on the FIRM meet the requirements of SMC 15.52.240.

J. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones V1-V30, V, and VE on the community’s FIRM shall either:

1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet or more above the level of the base flood elevation (100-year) at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1768 § 10, 1996: Ord. 1406 § 5.7, 1987)


15.52.255 Encroachments.

For all floodplain development, except emergency measures and floodplain habitat benefit projects, the applicant shall demonstrate through a technical analysis that the effect of any proposed development shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood at any point. For emergency measures and floodplain habitat benefit projects, the applicant shall demonstrate through a technical analysis that the effect of the proposed project shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot at any point. (Ord. 2596S § 4, 2017: Ord. 2596 § 4, 2017: Ord. 2538 § 2, 2015: Ord. 1447 § 4, 1989)


15.52.260 Appeal board.

A. The board of appeals as established by chapter 15.04* of this title shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.

B. The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals, or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Pierce County superior court.

D. In passing upon such applications, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter; and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

E. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection D of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

F. The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. (Ord. 1768 § 11, 1996: Ord. 1406 § 4.4-1, 1987)

*Code reviser’s note: Ordinance 2568 repeals chapter 15.04. The board of appeals provisions previously codified in the chapter have been replaced by the appeals process in the 2015 International Building Code adopted by Ordinance 2568.


15.52.270 Variances – Required conditions.

A. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 1 through 11 in subsection D of SMC 15.52.260 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section.

C. Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.



D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

E. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in SMC 15.52.260(D), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

F. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, or economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.

G. Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection A of this section, and otherwise complies with the general standards set out in SMC 15.52.160 and 15.52.170.

H. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 1406 § 4.4-2, 1987)


15.52.275 Application of chapter 15.06 SMC.

The provisions of chapter 15.06 SMC shall apply to this chapter. (Ord. 1782 § 27, 1996)

16.04.040 Designation of responsible official.

For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the community development director.

A. For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the lead agency or responsible official by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in WAC 173-806-020.

B. The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules (chapter 197-11 WAC) and make them available in accordance with chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 1695 § 1, 1995: Ord. 1261 § 4, 1984)


16.04.050 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

A. The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

B. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall forward it to the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.

C. When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

D. If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the department of ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within a 15-day period. Any such petition on behalf of city may be initiated by the responsible official.

E. The city is authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approves the agreement.

F. When the city makes a lead agency determination for a private project it shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 1642 §§ 2, 3, 1994; Ord. 1261 § 5, 1984)

For any proposal for a private project where the city would be the lead agency and for which one or more state agencies have jurisdiction, the responsible official may elect to transfer the lead agency duties to a state agency. The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC 197-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. (Ord. 1261 § 6, 1984)


16.04.070 Additional timing considerations.

If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. (Ord. 1695 § 2, 1995: Ord. 1261 § 7, 1984)


16.04.080 Categorical exemptions and threshold determinations – Purpose.

This section and SMC 16.04.085, 16.04.090, 16.04.100, and 16.04.110 of this chapter contain rules for deciding whether a proposal has a probable significant, adverse environmental impact requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This section and SMC 16.04.085, 16.04.090, 16.04.100, and 16.04.110 also contain rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference:

WAC

197-11-300    Purpose of this part.

197-11-310    Threshold determination required.

197-11-315    Environmental checklist.

197-11-330    Threshold determination process.

197-11-335    Additional information.

197-11-340    Determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

197-11-390    Effects of threshold determination.

(Ord. 1831 § 3, 1998: Ord. 1671 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1642 § 4, 1994; Ord. 1261 § 8, 1984)


16.04.085 Categorical exemptions.

A. If a proposal fits within any of the provisions in WAC 197-11-800, the proposal shall be categorically exempt from threshold determination requirements except as follows:

1. The proposal is not exempt under WAC 197-11-908, environmentally sensitive areas.

2. The proposal is a segment of a proposal that includes:

a. A series of actions, physically or functionally related to each other, some of which are categorically exempt and some of which are not; or

b. A series of exempt actions that are physically or functionally related to each other, and that together may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact in the judgement of an agency with jurisdiction. If so, that agency shall be the lead agency, unless the agencies with jurisdiction agree that another agency should be the lead agency. Agencies may petition the Department of Ecology to resolve disputes.

For such proposals, the agency or applicant may proceed with the exempt aspects of the proposals, prior to conducting environmental review, if the requirements of WAC 197-11-070 are met.

3. The proposal is subject to the threshold requirements pursuant to another land use or environmental regulation in order to address site specific impacts which cannot be anticipated prior to the proposal.

B. An agency is not required to document that a proposal is categorically exempt. Agencies may note on an application that a proposal is categorically exempt or place such a determination in agency files.

C. If the proposal is within the East Sumner Neighborhood Planned Action area and within threshold criteria adopted by Ordinance No. 2035 for the East Sumner Neighborhood Plan the proposal shall be categorically exempt from threshold determination requirements. (Ord. 2535 § 1, 2015: Ord. 1671 § 2, 1995)


16.04.090 Use of exemptions.

A. Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal, shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

B. In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

C. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that as authorized in WAC 197-11-070:

1. A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and

2. A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. (Ord. 1261 § 9, 1984)


16.04.100 Environmental checklist.

A. A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

B. For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

C. The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

1. The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

2. The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 1261 § 10, 1984)


16.04.105 Complete application and 90-day time frame for threshold determinations.

Repealed by Ord. 1695. (Ord. 1642 § 5, 1994)


16.04.110 Mitigated DNS.

A. As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

2. Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

C. The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 15 working days. The response shall:

1. Be written;

2. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and

3. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

D. As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

E. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

1. If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, to remove all negative impacts, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).

2. If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent stormwater runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

4. Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

F. Mitigated DNSs issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2), which requires a 14-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355(5), which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application.

G. Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

H. If the city’s decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3) (withdrawal of DNS).

I. The city’s written response under subsection C2 of this section shall not be construed as determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 1831 § 4, 1998; Ord. 1642 § 6, 1994; Ord. 1261 § 11, 1984)

A. The purpose of a variance is strictly limited to granting relief to specific development standards set forth in this division. A variance is also appropriate where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the property such that the strict implementation of this division would impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant. These provisions should be applied in a manner, which while protecting the environment, will assure that a person will be able to use his/her property in a fair and equitable manner.

B. In all instances of granting a variance, extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

C. An application for a variance shall be processed as a Type IV decision pursuant to chapter 18.56 SMC, Procedures for Land Use Permits. An application for variance shall be submitted on forms provided by the city and accompanying material as required by chapter 18.56 SMC.

D. Criteria for Granting Variances. Variances for development that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark, may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

1. That the strict requirements of the development standards set forth in this division preclude or significantly interfere with a reasonable use of the property not otherwise prohibited by this division.

2. That the hardship described above is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of this division, and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant’s own actions.

3. That the design of the project will be compatible with other permitted activities in the area and will not cause adverse effects to adjacent properties or the critical area.

4. That the variance authorized does not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by other properties in the area, and will be the minimum necessary to afford relief.

5. That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect. Variances for development that will be located either waterward of the ordinary high water mark or within regulated wetlands may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all the criteria stated above as well as the following:

a. That the strict application of the development standards set forth in this division precludes all reasonable use of the property; and

b. That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsections (D)(1) through (4) of this section.

E. In the granting of all variances, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances should not produce substantial adverse effects to the critical areas. 

F. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service shall be sent a notice of application for any variance requesting the reduction of buffer widths on Type III streams. (Ord. 2071 § 4, 2003: Ord. 1695 § 20, 1995: Ord. 1539 § 1 (part), 1992)

B. Following application for RWHA review, the director may refer the application and accompanying materials to appropriate state, federal, local and city agencies and departments for review and comment.

C. The director may apply conditions to the approval in order to ensure the conformance with standards or policies and to ensure that construction occurs in compliance with the standards and other conditions. (Ord. 2071 § 5, 2003: Ord. 1695 § 21, 1995)


16.40.140 Clustering.

The clustering of development on portions of property shall be allowed subject to the following standards:

A. For residentially zoned areas subject to chapter 16.46 SMC, Wetlands Protection, and chapter 16.56 SMC, Wildlife Habitat Area, the area of land established in buffers is equal to the “transferable buffer area” (TBA).

1. Clustering may apply to planned residential developments approved pursuant to chapter 18.40 SMC or to new subdivisions pursuant to chapter 17.16 SMC.

2. In the case of planned residential developments, the density may be increased beyond that provided for in SMC 18.24.060 provided the transferable buffer area is established as a separate conservation easement, dedication or other permanent method of preserving the land to the satisfaction of the director. The transfer rate for PRDs shall be one additional acre of development area credit for each two acres of transferable buffer area.

3. In the case of a full subdivision, the density allowed by the zoning may be increased beyond the limits of the underlying zoning according to the following table:

	Zoning	Cluster Ratio

	LDR-12	1 acre credit for 2 TBA acres

	LDR-8.5	1 acre credit for 3 TBA acres

	LDR-7.2	1 acre credit for 5 TBA acres

	LDR-6	1 acre credit for 5 TBA acres

The increase in density and resulting maximum number of lots shall be calculated using the following formula:

	(TBA x Cluster Ratio) + (Developable Area) 

	Minimum Lot Size of Underlying Zone

	 

	= Maximum Number of Lots

4. In no case shall the lot size be reduced to less than the minimum set forth below, in square feet:

	LDR-6:	4,800 

	LDR-7.2:	6,000 

	LDR-8.5:	7,200 

	LDR-12:	8,500

In no case shall the reduction in lot sizes be combined with the reduction in lot sizes allowed in SMC 18.12.070(A) or 18.12.090(A). 

5. The utilization of the transferable buffer area credits shall accompany a development proposal for the PRD or subdivision. The use of the credits shall be approved by the city council in conjunction with the PRD or preliminary plat.

6. In the case of a full subdivision, the TBA shall be established as a separate conservation easement, dedication or other permanent method of preserving the land to the satisfaction of the director.

7. In allowing lots less than 6,000 square feet, the council may reduce the rear yard requirements by a maximum of 40 percent.

B. For residentially zoned areas subject to chapter 15.52 SMC, the area of land within the special flood hazard area is equal to the “transferable buffer area” (TBA), provided any area within 200 feet of the shoreline pursuant to the shoreline master program shall not be included in the TBA. Properties within the special flood hazard area are eligible to modify lot size requirements to achieve clustering.

1. Development transfers may apply to planned residential developments approved pursuant to chapter 18.40 SMC or to a new subdivision pursuant to chapter 17.16 SMC.

2. In the case of planned residential developments, the density may be increased beyond that provided for in SMC 18.24.060 provided the transferable buffer area is established as a separate conservation easement, dedication or other permanent method of preserving the land to the satisfaction of the director. The transfer rate for PRDs shall be one additional acre of development area credit for each two acres of transferable buffer area.

3. In the case of a full subdivision, the density allowed by the zoning may be increased beyond the limits of the underlying zoning according to the following table:

	Zoning	Cluster Ratio

	LDR-12	1 acre credit for 2 TBA acres

	LDR-8.5	1 acre credit for 3 TBA acres

	LDR-7.2	1 acre credit for 5 TBA acres

	LDR-6	1 acre credit for 5 TBA acres

The increase in density and resulting maximum number of lots shall be calculated using the following formula:

	(TBA x Cluster Ratio) + (Developable Area) 

	Minimum Lot Size of Underlying Zone

	 

	= Maximum Number of Lots

4. In no case shall the lot size be reduced to less than the minimum set forth below, in square feet:

	LDR-6:	4,800 

	LDR-7.2:	6,000 

	LDR-8.5:	7,200 

	LDR-12:	8,500

5. The utilization of the transferable buffer area credits shall accompany a development proposal for the PRD or subdivision. The use of the credits shall be approved by the city council in conjunction with the PRD or preliminary plat.

6. In the case of a full subdivision, the TBA shall be established as a separate conservation easement, dedication or other permanent method of preserving the land to the satisfaction of the director.

7. In allowing lots less than 6,000 square feet, the council may reduce the rear yard requirements by a maximum of 40 percent.

C. For industrial and commercial zoned areas subject to chapter 16.46 SMC, Wetlands Protection, and chapter 16.56 SMC, Wildlife Habitat Area, the area of land established in buffers is equal to the “transferable buffer area” (TBA). Properties with such flood hazard designations are eligible to modify lot size requirements to achieve clustering.

1. Development transfers may apply to properties zoned industrial or commercial.

2. The density may be increased provided the transferable buffer area is established as a separate conservation easement, dedication or other permanent method of preserving the land to the satisfaction of the director. For each acre of TBA, an additional acre of non-TBA land on the same property may increase the allowable building height by 12 feet for structures in the non-TBA portion of the property.

3. The utilization of the transferable buffer area credits shall be approved by the hearing examiner according to the process for an administrative conditional use, chapter 18.56 SMC, provided the following are satisfied:

a. The TBA transfer is established with a permanent easement, property transfer or other mechanism to ensure the long-term protection of the area; and

b. The applicant has provided improvements, as necessary, to enhance the function and performance of the TBA.

D. For industrial and commercial zoned areas subject to chapter 15.52 SMC, the area of land within the special flood area is equal to the “transferable buffer area” (TBA), provided any area within 200 feet of the shoreline pursuant to the shoreline master program shall not be included in the TBA. Properties within the special flood hazard area are eligible to modify lot size requirements to achieve clustering.

1. Development transfers may apply to properties zoned industrial or commercial.

2. The density may be increased provided the transferable buffer area is established as a separate conservation easement, dedication or other permanent method of preserving the land to the satisfaction of the director. For each acre of TBA, an additional acre of non-TBA land on the same property may increase the allowable building height by 12 feet for structures in the non-TBA portion of the property.

3. The utilization of the transferable buffer area credits shall be approved by the hearing examiner according to the process for an administrative conditional use, chapter 18.56 SMC, provided the following are satisfied:

a. The TBA transfer is established with a permanent easement, property transfer or other mechanism to ensure the long-term protection of the area; and

b. The applicant has provided improvements, as necessary, to enhance the function and performance of the TBA.

E. In the event an area is within more than one transferable buffer area, the applicant may benefit from only one type of TBA for a given area of land. (Ord. 2596S § 5, 2017; Ord. 2596 § 5, 2017; Ord. 2071 § 6, 2003: Ord. 1906 §§ 1 – 4, 1999; Ord. 1539 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.40.150 Relationship to other regulations.

A. Variance applications from the provisions of the zoning regulations shall be made according to the provisions of chapter 18.50 SMC.

B. This division establishes minimum standards which are to be applied to specific activities on natural resource lands and in critical areas in order to achieve the purposes stated. In no way is this division intended to limit the application of SEPA or any other city, county, state or federal law or regulation.

C. Requests for varying the use to which a critical area habitat is to be put are not requests for variances, but rather requests for conditional uses. Such requests shall be evaluated using the zoning conditional use criteria set forth in chapter 18.48 SMC. (Ord. 2071 § 7, 2003: Ord. 1539 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.40.160 Bonds and financial guarantees.

The director may require an applicant to submit a financial guarantee to the city to guarantee any performance, mitigation or monitoring required as a condition of permit approval. The permit shall not be issued until the appropriate financial guarantee is received by the director. Financial guarantees shall be in the amount of 120 percent of the estimate of the cost of mitigation or monitoring to allow for inflation and administration should the city have to complete the mitigation or monitoring.

Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplement. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Wetland delineations are valid for five years; after such date the city shall determine whether a revision or additional assessment is necessary.

B. Rating. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington Department of Ecology wetland rating system, as set forth in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology), which contains the definitions and methods for determining whether the criteria below are met.

1. Category I. Category I wetlands are:   (a) wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR; (b) bogs; (c) wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more). These wetlands: (a) represent unique or rare wetland types; (b) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; (c) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (d) provide a high level of functions.

2. Category II. Category II wetlands are: wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points).

3. Category III. Category III wetlands are: (a) wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); (b) can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project. Wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.

4. Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scoring fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that we should be able to replace, or in some cases to improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions, and should be protected to some degree.

C. Illegal Modifications. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications made by the applicant or with the applicant’s knowledge. (Ord. 2693 § 2, 2019: Ord. 2212 § 5, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.080 Regulated activities.

A resource, wildlife, and hazard area (RWHA) approval shall be obtained prior to undertaking the following in a regulated wetland or its buffer unless authorized by SMC 16.46.090: 

A. The removal, excavation, grading, or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, minerals, organic matter, or material of any kind; 

B. The dumping, discharging, or filling with any material; 

C. The draining, flooding, or disturbing of the water level or water table; 

D. The driving of pilings; 

E. The placing of obstructions; 

F. The construction, reconstruction, demolition, or expansion of any structure; 

G. The destruction or alteration of wetlands vegetation through clearing, harvesting, shading, intentional burning, or planting of vegetation within a regulated wetland or its buffer that would alter the character of a regulated wetland; provided, that these activities are not part of a forest practice governed under chapter 76.09 RCW and its rules; or 

H. Activities adjacent to a regulated wetland or its buffer that result in a significant change of water temperature, a significant change of physical or chemical characteristics of wetlands water sources, including quantity, or the introduction of pollutants. (Ord. 2212 § 6, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.090 Exemptions and allowed uses in wetlands.

A. The following wetlands may be exempt from the requirement to avoid impacts (SMC 16.46.170(A)(1)), and they may be filled if the impacts are fully mitigated based on the remaining actions in SMC 16.46.170(A)(2) through (6). If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of credits from an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank, consistent with the terms and conditions of the program or bank. In order to verify the following conditions, a critical areas report for wetlands meeting the requirements in SMC 16.46.100 and 16.46.180 must be submitted:

1. All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet that:

a. Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers.

b. Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers.

c. Are not part of a wetland mosaic.

d. Do not score six or more points for habitat function based on the 2014 update to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology).

e. Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species of local importance identified in chapter 16.56 SMC.

2. Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this chapter.

B. In addition to those activities listed in SMC 16.40.080, the following activities shall be allowed within a wetland or wetland buffer provided they are conducted using best management practices, except where such activities result in the conversion of a regulated wetland or wetland buffer to a use to which it was not previously subjected: 

1. The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions or water sources;

2. Ongoing agricultural activities, provided they implement applicable best management practices (BMPs) contained in the latest editions of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG); or develop a farm conservation plan in coordination with the local conservation district. BMPs and/or farm plans should address potential impacts to wetlands from livestock, nutrient and farm chemicals, soil erosion and sediment control and agricultural drainage infrastructure. BMPs and/or farm plans should ensure that ongoing agricultural activities minimize their effects on water quality, riparian ecology, salmonid populations, and wildlife habitat;

3. The maintenance of drainage facilities and new drainage facilities provided they are an integral part of an ongoing agricultural activity and approved by the director;

4. The following uses are allowed within wetlands and/or wetland buffers; provided, that written notice at least 10 days prior to the commencement of such work has been given to the community development director; and provided, that wetland impacts are minimized and that disturbed areas are immediately restored:

a. Normal maintenance, repair, or operation of existing serviceable structures, facilities, or improved areas. Maintenance and repair does not include any modification that changes the character, scope, or size of the original structure, facility, or improved area and does not include the construction of a maintenance road;

b. Minor modification of existing serviceable structures within a buffer zone where modification does not adversely impact wetland functions or increase the size of the structure’s footprint; and

c. Utility line activities listed under SMC 16.40.100(G); provided, that BMPs are used and impacts are mitigated;

5. Emergency actions which must be undertaken immediately or for which there is insufficient time for full compliance with this chapter when it is necessary to: 

a. Prevent an imminent threat to public health or safety; or

b. Prevent imminent danger to public or private property; or 

c. Prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation. 

Prior to engaging in the action, the director shall provide a written determination on a case-by-case basis that the emergency action satisfies the general requirements of this subsection. 

In the event a person or emergency agency determines that the need to take emergency action is so urgent that there is insufficient time for review by the director, such emergency action may be taken immediately. Once the immediate threat has been addressed, any adverse impacts on critical areas should be minimized and mitigated. The person or agency undertaking such action shall notify the director within two working days following the commencement of the emergency action. Following such notification the director shall determine if the action taken was within the scope of the emergency actions allowed by this subsection. If the director determines that the action taken or part of the action taken is beyond the scope of allowed emergency actions, enforcement action is warranted. The director may require payment of fees to recover the costs associated with reviewing the emergency action;

6. Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a wetland, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column will be disturbed;

7. Enhancement of a wetland through the removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species;

8. Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way; provided, that the maintenance or repair does not expand the footprint of the facility or right-of-way;

9. Stormwater Management Facilities. A wetland or its buffer can be physically or hydrologically altered to meet the requirements of an LID, runoff treatment or flow control BMP if all of the following criteria are met:

a. The wetland is classified as a Category IV or a Category III wetland with a habitat score of three to five points; and

b. There will be “no net loss” of functions and values of the wetland; and

c. The wetland does not contain a breeding population of any native amphibian species; and

d. The hydrologic functions of the wetland can be improved as outlined in questions 3, 4, 5 of Chart 4 and questions 2, 3, 4 of Chart 5 in the “Guide for Selecting Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach” (available here: http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/0906032.html); or the wetland is part of a priority restoration plan that achieves restoration goals identified in a shoreline master program or other local or regional watershed plan; and

e. The wetland lies in the natural routing of the runoff, and the discharge follows the natural routing; and

f. All regulations regarding stormwater and wetland management are followed, including but not limited to local and state wetland and stormwater codes, manuals, and permits; and

g. Modifications that alter the structure of a wetland or its soils will require permits. Existing functions and values that are lost would have to be compensated/replaced. Stormwater LID BMPs required as part of new and redevelopment projects can be considered within wetlands and their buffers. However, these areas may contain features that render LID BMPs infeasible. A site-specific characterization is required to determine if an LID BMP is feasible at the project site. (Ord. 2693 § 3, 2019: Ord. 2212 § 7, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)

16.46.150 Buffer requirements.

The following buffer widths have been established in accordance with the best available science. They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology). The adjacent land use intensity is assumed to be high. Following the department’s determination of the category for a wetland associated with a proposal, the department shall determine appropriate buffer widths. Wetland buffer zones shall be evaluated for all development proposals and activities adjacent to wetlands to determine their need to protect the integrity, functions and values of the wetland. Wetland buffer widths are determined by the category of wetland, the intensity of impacts of a land use and the functions or special characteristics of the wetland that need to be protected as determined by the rating system. All wetland buffer zones are measured perpendicular from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. Except as otherwise permitted by this chapter, wetland buffers shall consist of a relatively intact native vegetation community adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of proposed activity. If the vegetation is inadequate then the buffer width shall be planted to maintain the buffer width.

A.    1. For wetlands that score six points or more for habitat function, the buffers in Table 1 can be used if both of the following criteria are met:

a. A relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide is protected between the wetland and any other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. The latest definitions of priority habitats and their locations are available on the WDFW website at: http://wdfw.wa.gov/hab/phshabs.htm.

The corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat by some type of legal protection such as a conservation easement.

Presence or absence of a nearby habitat must be confirmed by a qualified biologist. If no option for providing a corridor is available, Table 1 may be used with the required measures in Table 2 alone.

b. The measures in Table 2 are implemented, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

2. For wetlands that score three to five habitat points, only the measures in Table 2 are required for the use of Table 1.

3. If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 2, or is unable to provide a protected corridor where available, then Table 3 must be used.

4. The buffer widths in Tables 1 and 3 assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

5. Low Intensity Land Use. Buffer reduction up to 75 percent of the required buffer may be granted for low intensity land uses. The buffer reduction shall only apply to the below uses:

a. Passive recreation areas;

b. Nature parks with undeveloped trails. 

6. Increased Wetland Buffer Area Width. Buffer widths shall be increased on a case-by-case basis as determined by the administrator when a larger buffer is necessary to protect wetland functions and values. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the wetland. The documentation must include but not be limited to the following criteria:

a. The wetland is used by a state or federally listed plant or animal species or has essential or outstanding habitat for those species, or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or

b. The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion, and erosion-control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or

c. The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than 30 percent.

7. Buffer averaging to improve wetland protection may be permitted when all of the following conditions are met:

a. The wetland has significant differences in characteristics that affect its habitat functions, such as a wetland with a forested component adjacent to a degraded emergent component or a “dual-rated” wetland with a Category I area adjacent to a lower-rated area.

b. The buffer is increased adjacent to the higher-functioning area of habitat or more-sensitive portion of the wetland and decreased adjacent to the lower-functioning or less-sensitive portion as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional.

c. The total area of the buffer after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

d. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either three-quarters of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III, and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

8. Averaging to allow reasonable use of a parcel may be permitted when all of the following are met:

a. There are no feasible alternatives to the site design that could be accomplished without buffer averaging.

b. The averaged buffer will not result in degradation of the wetland’s functions and values as demonstrated by a critical areas report from a qualified wetland professional.

c. The total buffer area after averaging is equal to the area required without averaging.

d. The buffer at its narrowest point is never less than either three-quarters of the required width or 75 feet for Category I and II, 50 feet for Category III and 25 feet for Category IV, whichever is greater.

9. Low impact such as passive unpaved recreation trails.

B. To facilitate long-range planning using a landscape approach, the administrator may identify and pre-assess wetlands using the rating system and establish appropriate wetland buffer widths for such wetlands. The administrator will prepare maps of wetlands that have been pre-assessed in this manner.

C. Measurement of Wetland Buffers. All buffers shall be measured perpendicular from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. Buffers must be fully vegetated in order to be included in buffer area calculations. Lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas will not be considered buffers or included in buffer area calculations.

D. Buffers on Wetland Mitigation Sites. All wetland mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter. Buffers shall be based on the expected or target category of the proposed wetland mitigation site.

E. Buffer Maintenance. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed or enhanced condition. In the case of compensatory mitigation sites, removal of invasive nonnative weeds is required for the duration of the mitigation bond (SMC 16.46.190(D) and (E)).

F. Impacts to Buffers. Requirements for the compensation for impacts to buffers are outlined in SMC 16.46.170.

G. Overlapping Critical Area Buffers. If buffers for two contiguous critical areas overlap (such as buffers for a stream and a wetland), the wider buffer applies.

H. Allowed Buffer Uses. The following uses may be allowed within a wetland buffer in accordance with the review procedures of this chapter, provided they are not prohibited by any other applicable law and they are conducted in a manner so as to minimize impacts to the buffer and adjacent wetland:

1. Conservation or restoration activities aimed at protecting the soil, water, vegetation, or wildlife.

2. Passive recreation facilities designed and in accordance with an approved critical areas report, including:

a. Walkways and trails; provided, that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings may be acceptable.

b. Wildlife-viewing structures.

3. Educational and scientific research activities.

4. Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way; provided, that the maintenance or repair does not increase the footprint or use of the facility or right-of-way.

5. The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources.

6. Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a buffer, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer boundary; provided, that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column would be disturbed.

7. Enhancement of a wetland buffer through the removal of nonnative invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Revegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species. 

8. Repair and maintenance of non-conforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided they do not increase the degree of nonconformity.

I. Signs and Fencing of Wetlands and Buffers.

1. Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland buffer and the clearing limits identified by an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field with temporary “clearing limits” fencing in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur. The marking is subject to inspection by the administrator prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

2. Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the administrator may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

a. Permanent signs shall be made of an enamel-coated metal face and attached to a metal post or another nontreated material of equal durability. Signs must be posted at an interval of one every 50 feet, or one per lot if the lot is less than 50 feet wide, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The signs shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:

Protected Wetland Area Do Not Disturb

Contact City of Sumner 

Regarding Uses, Restrictions, and Opportunities for Stewardship

b. The provisions of subsection (I)(2)(a) of this section may be modified as necessary to assure protection of sensitive features or wildlife.

3. Fencing.

a. The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the wetland or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on site.

b. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat.

J. Except as otherwise specified, wetland buffer zones shall be retained in their natural condition. Where buffer disturbance has occurred during construction, revegetation with native vegetation shall be required. 

K. Regulated activities as specified in SMC 16.46.080 shall not be allowed in a buffer zone except for the following: 

1. Activities directly related to the cultural, recreational, scientific and education aspects of the wetland and which have a minimal adverse impact on the buffer and wetland area. These may include passive recreational facilities, trails, view points, short-term scientific or educational activities, and sport fishing or hunting; 

2. In all but Category I wetlands, public utility corridors may be allowed in buffer areas provided the proposal is subject to review under the State Environmental Policy Act and measures are provided to restore, replace and enhance the buffers and protect the wetland; 

3. In Category III and IV wetland buffers, stormwater management facilities having no reasonable alternative on-site location, or can show added wetland function and value; or 

4. In Category III and IV wetland buffers, development accessory to the site’s primary use and having no feasible alternative location.

L. A building setback line of 10 feet is required from the edge of any wetland buffer. Structural intrusions into the area of the building setback may be allowed if the director determines that such intrusions will not negatively impact the wetland. (Ord. 2693 § 4, 2019: Ord. 2549 § 2, 2015; Ord. 2532 § 5, 2015: Ord. 2212 § 11, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.160 Avoiding wetland impacts.

A. Regulated activities shall not be authorized in a regulated wetland except where either of the following conditions exist:

1. The impact is both unavoidable and necessary due to site-specific constraints not caused by the applicant.

2. All reasonable economic use of the property would be denied.

B. With respect to Category I wetlands, an applicant must demonstrate that denial of the permit would impose an extraordinary hardship on the part of the applicant brought about by circumstances peculiar to the subject property.

C. With respect to Category II and III wetlands, the following provisions shall apply:

1. For water-dependent activities, unavoidable and necessary impacts can be demonstrated where there are no practicable alternatives which would not involve a wetland or which would not have less adverse impact an a wetland, and would not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.

2. Where nonwater-dependent activities are proposed, it shall be presumed that adverse impacts are avoidable. This presumption may be rebutted upon a demonstration that:

a. The basic project purpose cannot reasonably be accomplished utilizing one or more other sites in the general region that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on a regulated wetland; and

b. A reduction in the size, scope, configuration, or density of the project as proposed and all alternative designs of the project as proposed that would avoid, or result in less, adverse impact on a regulated wetland or its buffer will not accomplish the basic purpose of the project; and

c. In cases where the applicant has rejected alternatives to the project as proposed due to constraints such as zoning, deficiencies of infrastructure, or parcel size, the applicant has made reasonable attempt to remove or accommodate such constraints.

D. With respect to Category IV wetlands, unavoidable and necessary impacts can be demonstrated where the proposed activity is the only reasonable alternative which will accomplish the applicant’s objectives.

E. Surface water discharge to a wetland from a flow control or water quality treatment facility, sediment pond or other surface water management activity or facility may be allowed if the discharge does not increase the rate of flow, does not adversely impact the plant composition in the wetland or decrease the water quality of the wetland. (Ord. 2212 § 12, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.170 Minimizing and replacing wetlands impacts.

A. Mitigation Sequencing. Before impacting any wetland or its buffer, an applicant shall demonstrate that the following actions have been taken. Actions are listed in the order of preference:

1. Avoid the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

2. Minimize impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts.

3. Rectify the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.

4. Reduce or eliminate the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.

5. Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments.

6. Monitor the required compensation and take remedial or corrective measures when necessary.

B. Requirements for Compensatory Mitigation.

1. Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only for impacts that cannot be avoided or minimized and shall achieve equivalent or greater biologic functions. Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans – Version 1, (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, Olympia, WA, March 2006, or as revised), and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009).

2. Mitigation ratios shall be consistent with subsection H of this section.

3. Mitigation requirements may also be determined using the credit/debit tool described in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised) consistent with subsection I of this section.

C. Compensating for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when either:

1. The lost wetland provides minimal functions, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

2. Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

D. Approaches to Compensatory Mitigation. Mitigation for lost or diminished wetland and buffer functions shall rely on the approaches listed below.

1. Wetland Mitigation Banks. Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the mitigation bank instrument. Use of credits from a wetland mitigation bank certified under chapter 173-700 WAC is allowed if:

a. The approval authority determines that it would provide appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts; and

b. The impact site is located in the service area of the bank; and

c. The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the certified mitigation bank instrument; and

d. Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits is consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified mitigation bank instrument.

2. In-Lieu Fee Mitigation. Credits from an approved in-lieu fee program may be used when all of the following apply:

a. The approval authority determines that it would provide environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts.

b. The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the approved in-lieu fee program instrument.

c. Projects using in-lieu fee credits shall have debits associated with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant’s qualified wetland professional using the credit assessment method specified in the approved instrument for the in-lieu fee program.

d. The impacts are located within the service area specified in the approved in-lieu fee instrument.

3. Permittee-Responsible Mitigation. In this situation, the permittee performs the mitigation after the permit is issued and is ultimately responsible for implementation and success of the mitigation. Permittee-responsible mitigation may occur at the site of the permitted impacts or at an off-site location within the same watershed. Permittee-responsible mitigation shall be used only if the applicant’s qualified wetland professional demonstrates to the approval authority’s satisfaction that the proposed approach is ecologically preferable to use of a bank or ILF program, consistent with the criteria in this section.

E. Types of Compensatory Mitigation. Mitigation for lost or diminished wetland and buffer functions shall rely on a type listed below in order of preference. A lower-preference form of mitigation shall be used only if the applicant’s qualified wetland professional demonstrates to the approval authority’s satisfaction that all higher-ranked types of mitigation are not viable, consistent with the criteria in this section.

1. Restoration. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland. For the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres, restoration is divided into:

a. Reestablishment. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. Reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres (and functions). Activities could include removing fill material, plugging ditches, or breaking drain tiles.

b. Rehabilitation. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland. Rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or return tidal influence to a wetland.

2. Establishment (Creation). The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site to develop a wetland on an upland or deep water site where a wetland did not previously exist. Establishment results in a gain in wetland acres. Activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod, create hydric soils, and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species.

a. If a site is not available for wetland restoration to compensate for expected wetland and/or buffer impacts, the approval authority may authorize creation of a wetland and buffer upon demonstration by the applicant’s qualified wetland professional that:

i. The hydrology and soil conditions at the proposed mitigation site are conducive for sustaining the proposed wetland and that creation of a wetland at the site will not likely cause hydrologic problems elsewhere;

ii. Adjacent land uses and site conditions do not jeopardize the viability of the proposed wetland and buffer (e.g., due to the presence of invasive plants or noxious weeds, stormwater runoff, noise, light, or other impacts); and

iii. The proposed wetland and buffer will eventually be self-sustaining with little or no long-term maintenance.

3. Enhancement. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten, intensify, or improve specific function(s) or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present. Enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement, floodwater retention, or wildlife habitat. Enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions, but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Activities typically consist of planting vegetation, controlling nonnative or invasive species, modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods, or some combination of these activities. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands or associated buffers shall demonstrate how the proposed enhancement will increase the wetland’s/buffer’s functions, how this increase in function will adequately compensate for the impacts, and how existing wetland functions at the mitigation site will be protected.

4. Protection/Maintenance (Preservation). Removing a threat to, or preventing the decline of, wetland conditions by an action in or near a wetland. This includes the purchase of land or easements, or repairing water control structures or fences. This term also includes activities commonly associated with the term “preservation.” Preservation does not result in a gain of wetland acres. Permanent protection of a Category I or II wetland and associated buffer at risk of degradation can be used only if:

a. The approval authority determines that the proposed preservation is the best mitigation option;

b. The proposed preservation site is under threat of undesirable ecological change due to permitted, planned, or likely actions that will not be adequately mitigated under existing regulations;

c. The area proposed for preservation is of high quality or critical for the health of the watershed or basin due to its location. Some of the following features may be indicative of high-quality sites:

i. Category I or II wetland rating (using the wetland rating system for Western Washington);

ii. Rare or irreplaceable wetland type (for example, bogs, mature forested wetlands, estuarine wetlands) or aquatic habitat that is rare or a limited resource in the area;

iii. The presence of habitat for priority or locally important wildlife species;

iv. Provides biological and/or hydrological connectivity;

v. Priority sites in an adopted watershed plan;

d. Permanent preservation of the wetland and buffer will be provided through a conservation easement or tract held by an appropriate natural land resource manager, such as a land trust;

e. The approval authority may approve other legal and administrative mechanisms in lieu of a conservation easement if it determines they are adequate to protect the site;

f. Ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation generally range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being impacted and the quality of the wetlands being preserved. Ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation generally start at 20:1.

F. Location of Compensatory Mitigation. Compensatory mitigation actions shall generally be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when the applicant can demonstrate that off-site mitigation is ecologically preferable. The following criteria will be evaluated when determining whether the proposal is ecologically preferable. When considering off-site mitigation, preference should be given to using alternative mitigation, such as a mitigation bank, an in-lieu fee program, or advance mitigation.

1. There are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Considerations should include: anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation, buffer conditions and required widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity);

2. On-site mitigation would require elimination of high-quality upland habitat;

3. Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the altered wetland;

4. Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless:

a. Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or

b. Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation, and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument; or

c. Fees are paid to an approved in-lieu fee program to compensate for the impacts;

5. The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape). Therefore, compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration, or enhancement of an atypical wetland.

G. Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. It is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will impact wetlands. At the least, compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and flora.

1. The administrator may authorize a one-time temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay. An appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties (e.g., project delay lapses past a fisheries window, or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials). The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety, or general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the city.

H. Wetland Mitigation Ratios.1

	Category and Type of Wetland	Creation or Reestablishment	Rehabilitation	Enhancement

	Category I:

Bog, natural heritage site	Not considered possible	Case by case	Case by case

	Category I:

Mature forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I:

Based on functions	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

I. Credit/Debit Method. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a-b, Olympia, WA, March 2006), the administrator may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised).

J. Buffer Mitigation Ratios. Impacts to buffers shall be mitigated at a minimum 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development.

K. Advance Mitigation. Mitigation for projects with pre-identified impacts to wetlands may be constructed in advance of the impacts if the mitigation is implemented according to federal rules, state policy on advance mitigation, and state water quality regulations consistent with Interagency Regulatory Guide: Advance Permittee-Responsible Mitigation (Ecology Publication No. 12-06-015, Olympia, WA, December 2012).

L. Alternative Mitigation Plans. The administrator may approve alternative wetland mitigation plans that are based on best available science, such as priority restoration plans that achieve restoration goals identified in the SMP. Alternative mitigation proposals must provide an equivalent or better level of protection of wetland functions and values than would be provided by the strict application of this chapter.

The administrator shall consider the following for approval of an alternative mitigation proposal:

1. The proposal uses a watershed approach consistent with Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Ecology Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009).

2. Creation or enhancement of a larger system of natural areas and open space is preferable to the preservation of many individual habitat areas.

3. Mitigation according to subsection E of this section is not feasible due to site constraints such as parcel size, stream type, wetland category, or geologic hazards.

4. There is clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the proposed mitigation site.

5. The plan shall contain clear and measurable standards for achieving compliance with the specific provisions of the plan. A monitoring plan shall, at a minimum, meet the provisions in SMC 16.46.180.

6. The plan shall be reviewed and approved as part of overall approval of the proposed use.

7. A wetland of a different type may be justified based on regional needs or functions and values; the replacement ratios may not be reduced or eliminated unless the reduction results in a preferred environmental alternative.

8. Mitigation guarantees shall meet the minimum requirements as outlined in SMC 16.46.180.

9. Qualified professionals in each of the critical areas addressed shall prepare the plan.

10. The city may consult with agencies with expertise and jurisdiction over the critical areas during the review to assist with analysis and identification of appropriate performance measures that adequately safeguard critical areas. (Ord. 2693 § 5, 2019: Ord. 2532 § 6, 2015; Ord. 2212 § 13, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.180 Mitigation plans.

All wetland and buffer restoration, creation, and/or enhancement projects required pursuant to this chapter either as a permit condition or as the result of an enforcement action shall follow a mitigation plan prepared by qualified wetland professionals approved by the director and shall contain the following: 

A. A description of the proposal and summary of impacts to wetlands and buffers; 

B. Baseline information for the impacted and any compensation site including written assessment and accompanying maps of the existing acreage; vegetative, faunal and hydrologic conditions; relationship within watershed and to existing water bodies; soil and substrate conditions, topographic elevations; existing and proposed adjacent site conditions; buffers; and ownership; 

C. Establish specific criteria (including water quality standards, survival rates of planted vegetation, species abundance and diversity targets, or other ecological, geological or hydrological criteria) for evaluating the mitigation proposal relative to the objectives of this chapter and the goals and objectives of the city’s comprehensive plan; 

D. Specify and describe the existing functions of the wetland and buffer to be impacted and how lost functions will be replaced; 

E. Specify when mitigation will occur relative to project construction and to the requirements of permits required by other jurisdictions; 

F. Detailed construction plans which establish the appropriate methods of construction, sequencing, and times of construction; 

G. Planting plan and list of plant species to be installed; 

H. Include provisions for monitoring the mitigation area to determine whether the mitigation plan is successful. Monitoring of the area shall include: 

1. Selection and appointment by the director of a qualified wetlands professional, at the expense of the applicant, and independent of the development, for purposes of monitoring the progress of the mitigated wetland; 

2. Monitoring shall begin by the designated consultant with a wetland analysis of the wetland being altered. Consultants will use the same data sheets within this analysis as will be used in the monitoring procedure; and 

3. Five years of monitoring and maintenance shall be required for mitigation of impacts. Monitoring reports shall be submitted by the qualified wetland professional to the city during the following years: one, three, and five for a five-year monitoring period. (Ord. 2212 § 14, 2007: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.190 Security and bonding.

A. An applicant or other holder of a permit shall be required to create a separate sensitive area tract or tracts containing the wetland and wetland buffer(s) or provide a permanent conservation easement, covenant or other instrument acceptable to the director to ensure the long-term protection of the wetland and buffers.

B. The following note shall appear on the face of all plats, short plats, PRDs, PMUDs, or other approved site plans containing separate sensitive area tracts, and shall be recorded on the title of record for all affected lots:

NOTE: All lots adjoining separate sensitive area tracts identified as Native Vegetation Protection Easements or protected by deed restriction are responsible for maintenance and protection of the tracts. Maintenance includes insuring that no alterations occur within the separate tract and that all vegetation remains undisturbed unless the express written authorization of the city has been received.

C. The location of the outer extent of the wetland buffer and the areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit shall be marked in the field, and such field marking shall be approved prior to the commencement of permitted activities. Such field markings shall be maintained by the applicant throughout the duration of the permit. 

D. The director shall require the applicant to post a cash performance bond, assignment of funds or other security acceptable to the director in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to fulfill the requirements of this chapter and any applicable conditions of approval. Provisions for monetary security shall be in an amount equal to 120 percent of the estimated funds necessary to complete work and monitoring in accordance with the mitigation plan, including restoration or rehabilitation to be performed if planned mitigation fails within the designated period of implementation. 

E. The director shall require the holder of an approval issued pursuant to this chapter to post a cash performance bond, assignment of funds or other security acceptable to the director in an amount and with surety and conditions sufficient to guarantee that structures, improvements, and mitigation required by the permit or by this chapter perform satisfactorily for a minimum of five years after they have been completed. The director shall release the maintenance bond upon determining that performance standards established for evaluating the effectiveness and success of the structures, improvements, and/or compensatory mitigation have been satisfactorily met for the required period. The maintenance bond applicable to a compensation project shall not be released until the director determines that performance standards established for evaluating the effect and success of the project have been met.

16.46.200 Nonconforming activities.

A regulated activity that was approved prior to the passage of this chapter but which is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter may be continued subject to the provisions of the Sumner zoning code.2 (Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.210 Appeals.

In addition to the reasonable use appeal provided in SMC 16.40.120, applicants for approvals pursuant to this chapter shall be able to request an interpretation and appeal such interpretation as provided in chapter 18.54 SMC, Interpretations. (Ord. 1695 § 30, 1995: Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.46.220 Assessment relief.

The Pierce County assessor shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a perpetual conservation restriction with the city or a nonprofit organization to permanently control some or all regulated activities in the wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessments on the controlled wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and water mains. (Ord. 1542 § 1 (part), 1992)1

Ratios for rehabilitation and enhancement may be reduced when combined with 1:1 replacement through creation or reestablishment. See Table 1a, Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance – Version 1 (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a, Olympia, WA, March 2006 or as revised).

16.54.010 Short title.

The ordinance codified in this chapter, together with any amendments, shall be known as the “Volcanic Hazard Area Ordinance.” (Ord. 1551 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.54.020 General authority.

This chapter is adopted under the authority of RCW 36.70A.050. (Ord. 1551 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.54.030 Purpose.

At over 14,410 feet high, Mount Rainier dominates the skyline of the southern Puget Sound region. This glacier-clad active volcano is capable of spewing ash from pyroclastic eruptions, and generating large volumes of lahars and floods which have, in the recent geologic past, inundated various watersheds and reached the shores of Puget Sound significantly altering pre-flood conditions. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use of land in and around volcanic hazard areas in order to protect lives, property, and public infrastructure; and to comply with the Washington State Growth Management Act. (Ord. 2071 § 28, 2003: Ord. 1551 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.54.040 Relationship to framework ordinance.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply in conjunction with SMC 16.40.030 through 16.40.200. (Ord. 1551 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.54.050 Applicability.

Volcanic hazard areas are areas within the city which show a likelihood of lahars, debris flows and related flooding associated with volcanic activity from Mt. Rainier. (Ord. 2071 § 29, 2003: Ord. 1551 § 1 (part), 1992)


16.54.060 Mapping.

A. Volcanic hazard areas are those areas that, in the recent geologic past, have been inundated by Case I or Case II lahars or other types of debris flows, according to a map showing Volcano Hazards from Mount Rainier, Washington: Pyroclastic-flow hazard zone and inundation zones for Case I, II, and III lahars, published by the U.S. Geological Survey, Revised 1998: USGS Open-File Report 98-428. Volcanic hazard areas also include areas that have not been affected recently, but could be affected by future such events. Volcanic hazard areas are classified into the following categories:

1. Inundation Zone for Case I Lahars. Areas that could be affected by cohesive lahars that originate as enormous avalanches of weak chemically altered rock from the volcano. Case I lahars can occur with or without eruptive activity. The average reoccurrence rate for Case I lahars on Mount Rainier is about 500 to 1,000 years.

2. Inundation Zone for Case II Lahars. Areas that could be affected by relatively large noncohesive lahars, which most commonly are caused by the melting of snow and glacier ice by hot rock fragments during an eruption, but which can also have a noneruptive origin. The average time interval between Case II lahars from Mount Rainier is near the lower end of the 100- to 500-year range, making these flows analogous to the so-called “100-year flood” commonly considered in engineering practice. 

B. Time Travel Zones. The ability to evacuate people from within a volcanic hazard area correlates to the distance from the source of an event (i.e., those areas closest to the event will have less time to evacuate than those areas farther away from the source of an event) and the amount of time for evacuation from the public notification (via a warning alarm system) that a lahar event has occurred. The amount of time that is anticipated for a debris flow, lahar, flood, or avalanche (estimated at 100 million cubic feet of volume) to travel from either the source of the event or the point where the AFM alarm is sounded is classified into the time travel zones. The city of Sumner and the urban growth area boundary are within Time Travel Zone C identified on the Pierce County Volcanic Hazard Areas Map which is based on the Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 60, pp. 98-109, titled: An Empirical Method for Estimating Travel Times for Wet Volcanic Mass Flows by T.C. Pierson, 1998. Time Travel Zone C is described as follows:

1. Time Travel Zone C on the Nisqually and White River systems is that area greater than an estimated 1-1/2-hour travel distance and less than or equal to an estimated two-hour travel distance from the source of the event.

2. Time Travel Zone C on the Puyallup and Carbon River systems is that area greater than an estimated one-hour travel distance and less than or equal to a 1-1/2-hour travel distance from the point where the AFM alarm is sounded. (Ord. 2071 § 30, 2003: Ord. 1551 § 1 (part), 1992)

The intent of this section is to establish minimum requirements and standards for fences in order to promote safety, provide screening, and to protect the aesthetic assets of the community. Fences constructed within multifamily zones shall not exceed a maximum height above the adjacent grade as set forth herein:

1. The requirements of this subsection shall apply only to fences built after the adoption date of the ordinance codified in this section. Fences built before that date shall be considered legal nonconforming fences. Existing fences being replaced after this adoption date shall meet the requirements of this section. The construction of any fence, arbor, or trellis requires a building/land use permit. 

2. Fences located within the required front yard or within a five-foot setback from the street side property line shall not exceed a height of three feet where fences would provide less than 50 percent visibility. Fences providing at least 50 percent visibility shall not exceed a height of four feet within the required front yard or within a five-foot setback from the street side property line. Examples of fences that could meet the 50 percent visibility include spaced rail fences, spaced picket fences, and chain link fences.

3. Corner lots located along minor arterials may construct a fence to the maximum height with a zero side yard setback along the minor arterial; provided, that all sight distance requirements are met.

4. No fence shall exceed a total height of six feet above existing or finish grade in a multifamily zone, unless exceptions of subsection (K)(9) of this section apply.

5. Fences utilized to enclose drainage detention ponds or other drainage facilities shall meet the requirements of the King County Washington Surface Water Design Manual, as well as any other applicable regulations of this section and the Sumner Municipal Code.

7. Chain link shall be black or green coated or painted in the front or street side yard.

8. Arbors and trellises will be subject to the following:

a. An arbor of up to three additional feet in height to a nine-foot maximum can be constructed over a gate, walkway, or entryway. The maximum width of an arbor shall be eight feet. These requirements apply to arbors sited in the front and side yard and to arbors attached to fences. Arbors shall be of structurally sound design.

b. A trellis of up to two additional feet in height to a maximum of eight feet may be added to a fence as a decorative element. Trellises with a horizontal element shall not encroach onto adjacent properties. Trellises shall be a structurally sound part of the fence design.

9. Exceptions to the standards set forth in this subsection are listed as follows: public facilities, minor and major utility facilities, schools, and wireless communication facilities may have fences higher than the required six-foot maximum for safety and security reasons, and are not subject to the requirements of this section. Such facilities needing added public safety and security shall construct fences in accordance to the standards set forth for such facilities.

10. Through lots with frontage along minor arterials may construct a fence to the maximum height with a zero setback along the minor arterial; provided, that all sight distance requirements are met.

L. Sight Distance Requirements. At all intersections there shall be a triangular yard area within which no tree, fence, shrub, wall or other physical obstruction shall be permitted higher than three feet above the adjacent grade where fences, walls and hedges would provide less than 50 percent visibility. Fences, walls, and hedges providing at least 50 percent visibility shall not exceed a height of four feet. Examples of fences that could meet the 50 percent visibility include spaced rail fences, spaced picket fences, and chain link fences. This triangular area shall measure as follows:

1. Street Intersections. At any intersection of two street rights-of-way, two sides of the triangular area shall extend 20 feet along both shoulder or curblines of the improved portion of the rights-of-way, measured from their point of intersection. For the purpose of this subsection, an alley shall be considered as a street.

2. Street and Driveway Intersections. At any intersection of a street right-of-way and a driveway, two sides of the triangular area shall extend 20 feet along the edge of the driveway and 10 feet along the shoulder or curbline of the improved portion of the right-of-way, measured from their point of intersection. Such triangular area shall be applied to both sides of the driveway.

3. Fences utilized to enclose drainage detention ponds or other drainage facilities shall meet the above regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations of the Sumner Municipal Code. 

M. Expansion of Specified Existing Uses. Existing automotive and motorized vehicle sales and rental agencies lawfully operating as of June 1, 2000, may be maintained as follows:

B. The commercial districts are established to provide appropriately located areas for office uses, retail stores, service establishments, and wholesale businesses, offering commodities and services required by residents of the city and its surrounding market area. In addition to this purpose, each commercial district has its own specific and unique intent as follows:

1. NC, Neighborhood Commercial District. The NC district is intended to provide for convenient retailing and other commercial services principally oriented to adjacent residential areas and neighborhoods.

2. CBD, Central Business District. The CBD district is intended to provide for retailing and other commercial services in a fashion that preserves and enhances the pedestrian scale and character of development in Sumner’s downtown area. Small, independent shops and offices are typical to this district.

3. GC, General Commercial District. The GC district is intended to provide for retailing and other commercial services that serve the large market area surrounding the Sumner community. In this respect, GC district regulations are intended to accommodate conventional commercial development that is typical to urban areas such as shopping centers, commercial malls and office complexes. Such commercial developments usually rely upon the automobile as their principal source of access.

4. IC, Interchange Commercial District. The IC district is intended to provide for retailing and other commercial services that are easily accessible from the freeway, yet are not located near residential districts. Such commercial developments primarily rely on the automobile as their principal source of access.

5. MUD, Mixed-Use Development District. The MUD district is intended to provide for a mix of residential and appropriate commercial services within close proximity to the historic central business district and increased housing density near regional transit centers.

18.18.010 Purpose.

A. The following manufacturing districts are established; properties so designated shall be subject to the provisions contained in this chapter:

1. M-1, light manufacturing district.

2. M-2, heavy manufacturing district.

3. Manufacturing/industrial core overlay (MICO).

B. Designation and Purpose. The manufacturing districts are intended to provide appropriately located areas for various manufacturing enterprises, industrial establishments, research developments and compatible commercial services that enhance the city’s economic base and provide jobs for residents of the area, while at the same time ensuring a high quality of life free from excessive noise, odors, dust, smoke, heavy traffic congestion and air and water pollution. In addition to this intent, each manufacturing district has its own specific and unique intent as follows:

1. M-1, light manufacturing district: The M-1 district is intended to provide areas for light manufacturing, general industrial activities, warehousing and limited service commercial uses that are complementary and are not detrimental to either existing or proposed industrial uses, or neighboring commercial and residential districts. Typical uses in this district include assembling and manufacturing of products from previously prepared material, and may include planned industrial parks which are designed to ensure compatibility between the industrial operations therein and the existing activities and character of the community in which the park is located.

2. M-2, heavy manufacturing district: The M-2 district is intended to provide areas for heavy manufacturing uses involving activities that do not complement the character of commercial or residential areas. M-2 zoned areas should be located so as to ensure that heavy manufacturing uses will not result in detrimental impacts to commercial or residential zones. Typical uses in this district include processing of natural and manmade materials for use in general manufacturing.

3. Manufacturing/industrial core overlay (MICO): The MICO is an overlay zone applied within the M-1 and M-2 districts, where limited alternate or additional regulations apply as noted in this chapter. The intent of the MICO is to apply additional restrictions on uses that may be incompatible with current manufacturing and industrial uses and the intensification of these uses in the future consistent with the city of Sumner comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2319 § 5, 2010: Ord. 1739 § 24, 1996: Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)

S. Fences – Intent. The intent of this section is to establish minimum requirements and standards for fences in order to promote safety, provide screening, and to protect the aesthetic assets of the community. Fences constructed in an industrial zone shall not exceed a maximum height above the adjacent grade as set forth herein:

1. The requirements of this subsection shall apply only to fences built after the adoption date of the ordinance codified in this section. Fences built before that date shall be considered legal nonconforming fences. Existing fences being replaced after this adoption date shall meet the requirements of this section. The construction of any fence, arbor, or trellis requires a building/land use permit.

2. Fences located within the required front yard or street side yard shall not exceed a height of three feet where fences would provide less than 50 percent visibility. Fences providing at least 50 percent visibility shall not exceed a height of four feet within the required front yard or street side yard. Examples of fences that could meet the 50 percent visibility include spaced rail fences, spaced picket fences, and chain link fences.

3. Fences located within industrial zones shall not exceed a total height of six feet above existing or finished grade in industrial zones unless exceptions of subsection (S)(6) of this section apply.

4. Fences utilized to enclose drainage detention ponds or other drainage facilities shall meet the requirements existing in the King County Washington Surface Water Design Manual, as well as any other applicable regulations of this section and the Sumner Municipal Code. Chain link fences used to enclose drainage detention ponds or other drainage facilities shall be green or black coated or painted.

5. Chain link shall be black or green coated or painted in the front or street side yard.

6. Exceptions to the standards set forth in this subsection are listed as follows. 

a. Public facilities, minor and major utility facilities, and wireless communication facilities may have fences higher than the required six-foot maximum for safety and security reasons, and are not subject to the requirements of this section. Such facilities needing added public safety and security shall construct fences in accordance to the standards set forth for such facilities.

b. Fences located around industrial sites that demonstrate a need to provide added security and public safety from harmful equipment and activities can exceed the height requirements set forth in this section to a maximum height of eight feet. Examples of a demonstrated need include sites utilizing draining facilities with steep slopes, water tanks, heavy or dangerous machinery or equipment, hazardous substances, hazardous waste, etc.

T. Sight Distance Requirements. At all intersections there shall be a triangular yard area within which no tree, fence, shrub or other physical obstruction shall be permitted higher than three feet above the adjacent grade where fences, walls and hedges would provide less than 50 percent visibility. Fences, walls and hedges providing at least 50 percent visibility shall not exceed a height of four feet. Examples of fences that could meet the 50 percent visibility include spaced rail fences, spaced picket fences, and chain link fences.

U. Incentives for Energy Conservation and Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions in M-1 Zone. An applicant may request and the director of community development may approve a building height increase to a maximum of 55 feet when greater than 100 feet from any street right-of-way or residentially or commercially zoned property and when providing one or more of the following features:

1. Construct to a LEED certified building.

2. Provide end-of-trip bicycle facilities including installing showers, securing bicycle lockers, and changing spaces. The director shall determine the ratio of facilities to the size of the workforce or building space.

1. Any approved development standards that differ from those in the code shall not require any further rezone, variance from city standards or other city approval apart from development agreement approval. The development standards as approved through a development agreement shall apply to and govern the development and implementation of each covered property in lieu of any conflicting or different standards or requirements elsewhere in the Sumner Municipal Code.

2. Subsequently adopted standards which differ from those of a development agreement adopted by the city shall apply to the covered property only where necessary to address imminent public health and safety hazards or where the development agreement specifies a time period or phase after which certain identified standards can be modified.

3. Projects subject to a development agreement are required to obtain approval for all applicable project permits unless otherwise expressly provided for in the approved development agreement.

C. Deviations from Development Standards. A development agreement may allow deviations from development standards imposed under the Sumner Municipal Code for the following reasons:

1. To provide flexibility to achieve public benefits; or

2. In order to respond to changing community needs; or

3. To encourage modifications which provide the functional equivalent or adequately achieve the purposes of otherwise applicable city standards.

4. The project preserves significant historic structures or demonstrates preservation and enhancement of the existing downtown character; and

5. The project will provide public amenities above that required by the existing zoning standards, including but not limited to parks, shoreline access, plazas, and/or pedestrian connections; and

6. The project will result in a superior design solution to what would otherwise be achieved by applying the specific requirements of chapter 18.40 SMC, Design and Development Guidelines; and

7. The proposed deviations to zoning development standards are consistent with the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.

D. Type VI Permit. All land use permits for projects developed utilizing this subsection shall be processed as a Type VI permit or higher numbered permit type if applicable.

18.20.030 Enforceability.

Unless amended or terminated, a development agreement is enforceable during its term by a party to the agreement. A development agreement and the development standards in the agreement govern during the term of the agreement, or for all or that part of the build-out period specified in the agreement. The agreement may not be subject to an amendment to a zoning ordinance or development standard or a new zoning ordinance or development standard or regulation adopted after the effective date of the agreement. The permit approval issued by the city after the execution of the agreement must be consistent with the development agreement. (Ord. 2523 § 1 (part), 2015)


18.20.040 Processing procedure for development agreements.

A. Legislative Actions. A development agreement associated with a legislative action such as a comprehensive plan amendment or area-wide rezone shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established in this title and subsection, except as provided for in subsection C of this section. The planning commission shall make its recommendation on any development agreement relating to legislative action to the city council. A public hearing shall be held on the development agreement and, if approved, the council shall authorize the mayor, in an ordinance, to execute the development agreement on behalf of the city.

B. Project Permits. A development agreement associated with a project permit application shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established in this title and subsection.

1. If the final decision on the underlying project permit application is made by the hearing examiner, then the hearing examiner shall consider both the project permit application and the proposed development agreement together during the public hearing. The hearing examiner shall make a recommendation to the council on the development agreement and his/her decision on the underlying project permit application shall be held in abeyance until the city council considers the proposed development agreement in a public hearing. If the city council approves the development agreement, the council shall, by ordinance or resolution, authorize the mayor to execute the development agreement on behalf of the city. At this point, the hearing examiner may then issue his/her final decision on the underlying project permit application. Nothing in this section obligates the hearing examiner to forward a recommendation to the city council for further consideration if the hearing examiner denies the underlying project permit application.

2. If the final decision on the underlying project permit application is made by the city administrative staff, then the city staff shall consider both the project permit application and the proposed development agreement together. The city staff shall make a recommendation to the council on the development agreement, and the city staff’s decision on the underlying project permit application shall be held in abeyance until the city council considers the proposed development agreement in a public hearing. If the city council approves the development agreement, the council shall, by ordinance or resolution, authorize the mayor to execute the development agreement on behalf of the city. At this point, the city staff may then issue its final decision on the underlying project permit application. Nothing in this section obligates city staff to forward a recommendation to the city council for further consideration if city staff denies the underlying project permit application.

3. If a final decision on an underlying project permit application has been previously made by the hearing examiner or city administrative staff and the application was approved, the city staff shall make a recommendation to the council on the development agreement. A public hearing shall be held on the development agreement and, if approved, the council shall authorize the mayor, in an ordinance or resolution, to execute the development agreement on behalf of the city.

C. Public Hearing and Notice. All development agreements shall be subject to review and approval by the council after a duly noticed public hearing pursuant to RCW 36.70B.200. All public hearings on a development agreement shall be noticed as follows:

1. Class D notice per SMC 18.56.070(B)(4) shall be provided.

2. All costs associated with the public notice shall be borne by the applicant. (Ord. 2702 § 1, 2019: Ord. 2523 § 1 (part), 2015)


18.20.050 No deadline for final decision – Form of agreement – Term – Recordation.

A. No Deadline for Final Decision. Development agreements are not “project permit applications” as defined in RCW 36.70B.020. Therefore, there is no deadline for processing a development agreement. If an applicant requests that the city execute a development agreement as part of its approval of a project permit application, the applicant must agree to sign a written waiver of the deadline for issuance of a final decision of the project permit application, so that the development agreement may be processed.

B. Form of Agreement. Development agreements shall be consistent with RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210, as currently written or hereafter amended. No development agreement shall be presented to the decision-making body unless in a form approved by the city attorney. Every development agreement shall be signed or approved by the property owner and all other parties with a substantial beneficial interest in the property that is the subject of the development agreement, prior to any public hearing held for the purpose of authorizing execution of the development agreement.

C. Term.

1. Development agreements may be approved for a maximum period of 20 years.

2. In determining the appropriate term for a development agreement, the council should consider the type, size and location of development and phasing if proposed.

3. Extensions. If extensions are authorized in a development agreement, an applicant must request the extension at least 60 days prior to expiration. For development agreements associated with project permit applications, the community development director may grant an extension for up to five years if the applicant can satisfactorily show that, for a residential project, at least 50 percent of the residential units are constructed, or for nonresidential and mixed use projects, at least 50 percent of the gross floor area is constructed. All other requests for extensions shall be reviewed by the city council, unless another process is expressly provided for in the development agreement. In no case shall an extension be granted which would allow a development agreement to exceed 20 years.

D. Recordation. A development agreement shall be recorded against the property, in the real property records of the Pierce County auditor’s office. All costs associated with the recording of the development agreement shall be borne by the applicant or property owner. During the term of the development agreement, the agreement is binding on the parties and their successors, including the property owners in any area that is annexed to the city.

18.26.010 Purpose and intent.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to encourage mixed site and building design and compatible, symbiotic use through greater flexibility in the utilization of land in planned group developments while ensuring substantial compliance with the goals and policies of the Sumner comprehensive plan. In exchange for the enhanced flexibility offered by the planned mixed-use development, the city requires that the proposed development result in a significantly higher quality of design, generate more of a public benefit, and be more environmentally sensitive than would have been the case with the use of standard zoning procedures. Furthermore, it is the purpose of this chapter to:

A. Promote the sensitive treatment of significant features of the natural environment, including vegetation, waterways and views and viewsheds;

B. Create and maintain usable open spaces for the enjoyment of occupants, employees and/or patrons;

C. Encourage a variety of mixture of harmoniously related building types including mixed-use structures, and ground-related residential, that may be stand-alone multifamily residential such as live/work units, townhouses, and cottages;

D. Encourage maximum efficiency in the layout of streets, use of “complete streets” that incorporate pedestrian, bicycling, and transit options, utility networks and other improvements; 

E. Promote green, sustainable, and environmentally friendly development through the use of innovative building design (e.g., LEED certified), energy and water conservation, and low impact development, reuse of historic structures; and 

F. Provide for buffers between potentially incompatible uses. (Ord. 2531 § 9 (part), 2015: Ord. 2343 § 2 (part), 2010: Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)

Sections:

18.38.010    Purpose.

18.38.020    Use regulations.

18.38.030    Variance from distance requirements.

18.38.040    Parking requirements.

18.38.050    Signage.

18.38.060    Permit review.

18.38.070    Amortization.

18.38.080    Enforcement.


18.38.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect the general public, health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of adult entertainment businesses through zoning. The regulations set forth herein are intended to prevent crime, protect the city’s retail trade, maintain property values, and generally to protect and preserve the quality of the city’s neighborhoods, business and commercial districts, and the quality of life while allowing reasonable opportunities for the location of adult entertainment businesses within the city. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.020 Use regulations.

A. Minimum Distance Requirements. The following business requirements or buffers are established for any adult entertainment business. Any distance requirements shall be measured by following a direct line, without regard to intervening properties or buildings, from the nearest point of the property parcel, lot, grounds, or area of any of the below listed uses to the nearest point of the lot or parcel upon which any adult entertainment business is proposed to be located:

1. No adult entertainment business shall be located closer than 1,000 feet from any area zoned for residential use, nor closer than 1,000 feet from any library, any government building, any public or private school, university or college, any public playground, trail or recreation facility, any licensed day care center for children, any day care home or preschool, any church or religious facility, any youth activity center, any tavern or restaurant which has a state liquor license, any adult bookstore, any adult retail store, any adult video store, any adult motion picture theater, any adult mini-motion picture theater, or any adult entertainment business. The 1,000-foot buffer shall apply whether any of the above-listed uses or facilities are located inside or outside of the corporate limits of the city.

2. No adult entertainment business shall be located closer than 500 feet from any residential structure located inside or outside of the corporate limits of the city. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.030 Variance from distance requirements.

A. Whenever the proponent of an adult business establishment, subject to the distance requirements of SMC 18.38.020, feels that strict application of such requirements is not necessary to achieve an effective degree of physical separation between the adult business establishment and the uses set forth in SMC 18.38.020(A)(1) and (2), the proponent may do so only after obtaining a variance from the hearing examiner.

B. The uses set forth in SMC 18.38.020 (A)(1) and (2) shall not be located within 1,000 feet of an adult entertainment business. The party proposing to locate such a use within 1,000 feet of an adult entertainment business is considered an intervening use and may do so only after obtaining a variance from the hearing examiner.

C. A proponent of an adult business establishment or a party proposing an intervening use may apply to the hearing examiner for a variance from the requirements of SMC 18.38.020(A)(1) and (2). In determining when a variance should be granted and, if so, to what extent, the hearing examiner shall consider the following, in addition to the general criteria for the granting of a variance in SMC 18.50.030:

1. Topographical and other features of the land which provide actual separation between the proposed business or other land use and surrounding land uses;

2. Ability to avoid the adult entertainment business by alternate pedestrian and vehicular circulation routes; and

3. Any other fact or circumstance which has a significant effect upon the need for the full separation distance required by SMC 18.38.020.

If after considering these criteria the hearing examiner finds that an effective separation between the proposed adult business establishment and the uses set forth in SMC 18.50.020 can be achieved without requiring the full distance of separation provided by SMC 18.38.020, the hearing examiner shall determine the degree of variance to be allowed and shall grant such variance. Otherwise, the application for variance shall be denied. A request for reconsideration or appeal from the decision of the hearing examiner shall be governed by SMC 2.58.150 and 2.58.160. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.040 Parking requirements.

All parking areas for adult entertainment businesses shall be visible from the street fronting the structure. No access shall be allowed from the rear of the structure. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.050 Signage.

In addition to the restrictions imposed by this title or chapter based upon the zone or district in which the use is located, and the sign code, chapter 18.44 SMC, the following restrictions shall apply to any adult business as defined in chapter 18.04 SMC:

A. There may be no more than two signs, even if the business fronts on more than one street.

B. Each display surface of a sign must:

1. Be a flat plane, rectangular in shape;

2. Not be flashing or pulsating;

3. Have characters of a solid color;

4. Have no pictorial or graphic symbols on the sign;

5. The informational material shall be limited to the name and address of the business, identification of the establishment as an adult use, and the days and hours of operation.

C. The exterior of the building must comply with the requirements provided in the zoning code unless the owner elects to use the building exterior as the primary sign. Any message painted, attached, or otherwise applied to the exterior of the building is a display surface and is subject to the provisions of this section and the sign code, chapter 18.44 SMC.

D. Signs shall comply with the base zone sign regulations in terms of aggregate sign area, height, location, and other applicable requirements. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.060 Permit review.

An applicant shall prepare an environmental checklist and be subject to a threshold determination pursuant to WAC 197-11-310. In addition to the standard application materials, an applicant for an adult entertainment business shall submit to the director an independently prepared study addressing the economic impacts of the proposal. The study shall address such issues as property values, blighting, tax revenues, changes to commercial receipts, and other related issues which could directly or indirectly result from the proposal. The report shall be prepared by persons with sufficient expertise in this field as determined by the director. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.070 Amortization.

A. The nonconforming use provisions set forth in chapter 18.46.040 SMC shall not apply to adult entertainment businesses. For the purposes of this chapter, a “nonconforming use” constitutes an adult entertainment business which lawfully existed prior to annexation by the city and is maintained after the effective date of annexation and does not comply with the adult use business zoning requirements set forth in this chapter. Adult entertainment businesses established in the city limits which become nonconforming by virtue of uses that are annexed into a city causing buffer provisions to be no longer met shall also be considered a nonconforming use.

B. Adult entertainment businesses which are nonconforming uses as a result of any annexation by the city of Sumner shall be discontinued within two years of the date of annexation. Adult entertainment businesses which are nonconforming cannot be expanded, enlarged or intensified. Any building containing a nonconforming adult entertainment business may only be maintained with ordinary repair. It cannot be expanded or enlarged. Any change in a nonconforming adult entertainment business shall be to a use which is legally permitted within the zone in which it is located.

C. In the event a nonconforming adult entertainment business determines that the period set forth in subsection B of this section does not provide the adult entertainment business with a reasonable period of amortization, then no later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the period, the nonconforming adult entertainment business shall make application to the hearing examiner for an extension of time. The application shall be processed as a conditional use permit. Factors to be considered by the hearing examiner include the secondary adverse effects of the business on the neighborhood/community, the location of the business in relation to sensitive land uses such as schools, parks, churches, residential zone(s), and the business’ initial capital investment, investment realization to date, life expectancy of the investment, the existence or nonexistence of a lease obligation, as well as a contingency clause permitting termination of the lease, or whether a reasonable alternate use of the property exists.

D. Upon annexation, all nonconforming adult entertainment businesses shall provide the director of community development with copies of their current leasehold document(s) which sets forth their existing leasehold time period, or, in the case of a nonleasehold interest, the director of community development shall be provided with other documents which show record of ownership. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.38.080 Enforcement.

A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the zoning code, any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance per se, which shall be abated by the city attorney by way of civil abatement procedures only, and not by criminal prosecution.

B. Nothing in this section is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation, or maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any city ordinance or statute of the state of Washington regarding public nuisances, sexual conduct, lewdness, or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. (Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)

18.39.040 Process for designating properties or districts to the Sumner Historic Register.

A. Any person may nominate a building, structure, site, object, or district for inclusion in the Sumner Historic Register. Members of the historic preservation commission or the commission as a whole may generate nominations. In its designation decision, the commission shall consider the Sumner Historic Register and the city of Sumner comprehensive plan.

B. In the case of individual properties, the designation shall include the UTM reference and all features – interior and exterior – and outbuildings that contribute to its designation. 

C. In the case of districts, the designation shall include description of the boundaries of the district; the characteristics of the district justifying its designation; and a list of all properties including features, structures, sites, and objects contributing to the designation of the district. 

D. The historic preservation commission shall consider the merits of the nomination, according to the criteria in SMC 18.39.060 and according to the nomination review standards established in rules, at a public meeting. Adequate notice will be given to the public, the owner(s) and the authors of the nomination, if different, and lessees, if any, of the subject property prior to the public meeting according to standards for public meetings established in rules and in compliance with chapter 42.30 RCW, Open Public Meetings Act. Such notice shall include publication in a newspaper of general circulation in Sumner and any other form of notification deemed appropriate by the city of Sumner. If the commission finds that the nominated property is eligible for the Sumner Historic Register, the commission shall make recommendation to the city council that the property be listed in the register with the owner’s consent. In the case of historic districts, the commission shall consider a simple majority of property owners (50 percent plus one percentage of property owners) to be adequate for owner consent. Owner consent and notification procedures in the case of districts shall be further defined in rules. The public, property owner(s) and the authors of the nomination, if different, and lessees, if any, shall be notified of the listing. 

E. Properties listed on the Sumner Register of Historic Places shall be recorded on official zoning records with an “HR” (for historic register) designation. This designation shall not change or modify the underlying zone classification. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.050 Effects of listing on the register.

A. Listing on the Sumner Historic Register is an honorary designation denoting significant association with the historic, archaeological, engineering, or cultural heritage of the community. Properties are listed individually or as contributing properties to an historic district. 

B. Prior to the commencement of any work on a register property, excluding ordinary repair and maintenance and emergency measures defined in SMC 18.39.030, the owner must request and receive a certificate of appropriateness from the commission for the proposed work. Violation of this rule shall be grounds for the commission to review the property for removal from the register. 

C. Once Sumner is certified as a certified local government (CLG), all properties listed on the Sumner Historic Register may be eligible for special tax valuation on their rehabilitation per SMC 18.39.130. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.060 Criteria for determining designation on the Sumner Historic Register.

Any building, structure, site, object, or district may be designated for inclusion in the Sumner Historic Register if it is significantly associated with the history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, or cultural heritage of the community; if it has integrity; is at least 50 years old, or is of lesser age and has exceptional importance; and if it falls in at least one of the following categories: 

A. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of national, state, or local history. 

B. Embodies the distinctive architectural characteristics of a type, period, style, or method of design or construction, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction.

G. Is a building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the only surviving structure significantly associated with an historic person or event. 

H. Is a birthplace or grave of an historical figure of outstanding importance and is the only surviving structure or site associated with that person. 

I. Is a cemetery which derives its primary significance from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events or cultural patterns. 

J. Is a reconstructed building that has been executed in a historically accurate manner on the original site. 

K. Is a creative and unique example of folk architecture and design created by persons not formally trained in the architectural or design professions, and which does not fit into formal architectural or historical categories. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.070 Review of changes to Sumner Historic Register properties.

A. No person shall change the use, construct any new building or structure, or reconstruct, alter, restore, remodel, repair or move any existing property on the Sumner Historic Register or within an historic district on the Sumner Historic Register without review by the commission and without receipt of a certificate of appropriateness. 

B. The review shall apply to all features of the property, interior and exterior, that contribute to its designation and are listed on the nomination form. Information required by the commission to review the proposed changes is established in rules. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.080 Removal of properties from the register.

In the event that any property is no longer deemed appropriate for designation to the Sumner Historic Register, the commission may initiate removal from such designation by the same procedure as provided for in establishing the designation, SMC 18.39.040. A property may be removed from the Sumner Historic Register without the owner’s consent. A property may also be removed upon the request of the owner; however, in this case, the owner must be notified of potential liabilities if advantage has been taken of state or federal tax abatements, deferrals, special valuation programs, or similar, while on the register. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.090 Exemptions from certificate of appropriateness.

The following activities do not require a certificate of appropriateness or review by the commission:

A. Ordinary repair and maintenance, including painting; or

B. Emergency measures defined in SMC 18.39.030. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.100 Review process for certificate of appropriateness or waiver.

A. The zoning official shall report any application for a permit to work on a designated Sumner Register of Historic Places registered property or in a Sumner Historic Register or historic district to the commission. If the activity is not exempt from review, the commission or professional staff shall notify the applicant of the review requirements. The building or zoning official shall not issue any such permit until a certificate of appropriateness is received from the commission but shall work with the commission in considering building and fire code requirements. 

B. Commission Review. The building or zoning official shall route applications for permits on a designated historic property to the commission for a review of proposed changes on a Sumner Register of Historic Places property or within a Sumner Historic Register historic district and request a certificate of appropriateness. Each application for review of proposed changes shall be accompanied by such information as is required by the commission established in its rules for the proper review of the proposed project. 

C. The commission shall review the proposed work according to the design review criteria established in rules. The applicant may request to meet with the commission. Unless legally required, there shall be no notice, posting, or publication requirements for action on the application, but all such actions shall be made at regular meetings of the commission. The commission shall complete its review and make its recommendations within 30 calendar days of the date of receipt of the application. If the commission is unable to process the request, the commission may ask for an extension of time. 

D. The commission’s recommendations shall be in writing and shall state the findings of fact and reasons relied upon in reaching its decision. Any conditions agreed to by the applicant in this review process shall become conditions of approval of the permits granted. If the owner agrees to the commission’s recommendations, a certificate of appropriateness shall be awarded by the commission according to standards established in the commission’s rules.

E. The commission’s recommendations and, if awarded, the certificate of appropriateness shall be transmitted to the building or zoning official. If a certificate of appropriateness is awarded, the building or zoning official may then issue the permit. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)


18.39.110 Appeal of approval or denial of a waiver of a certificate of appropriateness.

The commission’s decision regarding a waiver of a certificate of appropriateness may be appealed to the city council within 10 days. The appeal must state the grounds upon which the appeal is based. 

The appeal shall be reviewed by the council only on the records of the commission. Appeal of council’s decision regarding a waiver of a certificate of appropriateness may be appealed to superior court. (Ord. 2275 § 2 (part), 2008)

(Ord. 2068 § 1, 2003: Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.42.045 Parking in Central Business District parking area.

A. The boundaries of the central business district parking area shall be defined as any area with a central business district designation and west of Meade Avenue.

B. Within the central business district parking area, certain new and expanding uses are allowed an administrative waiver from the parking requirements, provided all of the following are satisfied:

1. The proposed use is a retail, business or commercial use; business or professional office; restaurant not exceeding 3,000 gross square feet; assembly use not exceeding an occupancy of 50; or a food store or market not exceeding 2,500 square feet.

2. The property owner enters into an agreement to not protest the formation of a future local improvement district to provide additional parking.

3. The proposal will not result in the displacement of existing private parking established as accessory to an existing structure. The required parking may only be removed if such structure is similarly removed or a conditional use approval is granted as provided below.

C. A use which is not allowed an administrative waiver from the parking requirements in the central business district parking area, may apply to the hearing examiner for conditional use approval to allow such use without all or a portion of the required parking.

1. In determining whether to grant a proposed conditional use for certain uses without all or a portion of the parking in the central business district parking area, the hearing examiner and city council shall consider the general conditional use criteria and the specific criteria listed below:

a. Uses which have peak parking demands during times of low parking demand for other uses in the central business district parking area shall be preferred.

b. Uses with documented clientele which would complement and support other uses in the central business district parking area are preferred.

c. Projects which are in close proximity to existing public parking lots with capacity to accommodate additional parking during periods of peak demand from the proposed uses are preferred.

d. Projects which provide a portion of their required parking or directly create new public parking are preferred over those which provide no parking.

e. Projects whose overall design and use complement the downtown and further the goals of the comprehensive plan shall be preferred.

2. Based on the review of the proposal, the hearing examiner and city council may deny the proposal, if it does not sufficiently satisfy the above criteria. A proposal must satisfy criterion (e) of the previous sub-section and at least three of criteria (a) through (d) of the previous subsection.

3. When considering a conditional use permit for a use subject to the provisions of this section, the hearing examiner or city council may, as a condition to the granting thereof, require the applicant make other necessary improvements to improve parking and access.

D. Developments which would result in the removal of required private parking within the boundaries of the central business district parking area may apply for conditional use approval to allow such development pursuant to the criteria and standards of SMC 18.42.045 (C).

E. When determining the amount of contribution of a particular project towards providing parking through a future local improvement district, the demand created by the new use and any resulting loss of existing parking shall be considered. An applicant may credit towards this obligation, any new public parking within the central business district parking area towards which they directly provide or contribute. For purposes of this credit, one public parking space shall be credited as two required private spaces. In order to qualify as public parking, it must be dedicated to the city or occur on city owned property, and be available at all times for public parking.

F. Any proposal for a conditional use permit to waive all or a portion of the parking shall be accompanied with an agreement to not protest a future local improvement district for parking. (Ord. 2147 § 17, 2005; Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)


18.42.046 Truck-related parking in interchange commercial truck parking overlay area.

1. The truck parking is accessory to a permitted use denoted in Table 18.16.020 by footnote No. 9. The truck parking shall be deemed accessory if it meets the following criteria:

a. Truck-related parking on each site must be provided in a separate designated truck parking area.

b. The designated truck parking area shall be limited to no more than 40 percent of the gross site acres or an equivalent fraction thereof. For purposes of this subsection (A)(1)(b) only, landscaping required by SMC 18.16.080 shall not be considered part of the designated truck parking area.

c. The principal use allows truck-related parking as indicated in SMC 18.16.020.

2. The truck parking must be provided in a designated area on the same parcel as the principal use and must meet the following requirements:

a. Except as provided in subsection (A)(2)(f) of this section, truck parking in a designated truck parking area shall be on a fee basis. The fee amount shall be determined by the business owner but shall include any taxes or other charges required by the city of Sumner and/or the state of Washington per chapter 80.82 RCW.

b. The truck parking shall be provided on a paid basis such that the owners and/or operators of trucks must obtain a parking validation from the business certifying that the applicable fee has been paid or waived. At property owners’ discretion, parking for up to three hours may be provided without a fee.

f. A truck parking area that allows parking for no more than three hours may be provided without a fee. Such parking area may be constructed without meeting the provisions of subsections (A)(2)(b) through (d) of this section. In addition, such nonfee truck parking area is not required to meet the landscaping requirements set forth in SMC 18.42.046(X), but must instead meet the landscape provisions of SMC 18.16.080(B). The area of such nonfee truck parking shall be part of the 40 percent site coverage limitation on designated truck parking areas established per subsection (A)(1)(b) of this section. Allowing truck parking in such nonfee truck parking areas in excess of three hours will be considered a violation of this title as described in SMC 18.59.020.

B. Truck-Related Parking on Parcels under Common Ownership.

1. Owners of multiple adjacent parcels may propose to locate permitted uses for which truck parking is allowed and the related accessory truck parking on any portion of their common ownership so long as all conditions and standards above are met on the combined sites.

18.43.010 Purpose of requirements for access management within the East Main Street area.

The design requirements of this section are intended to implement the East Main Street design strategy and recognize that East Main Street serves three divergent functions: moving traffic through the city, providing both safe vehicular and pedestrian access to individual properties located along the street, and as an extension of the downtown business core. The traffic movement function of East Main Street can compromise the provision of safe vehicular and pedestrian access to individual properties. In addition, the use of multiple driveways along East Main Street detracts from the aesthetic appeal of the area for pedestrians and auto traffic to the detriment of businesses. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to maintain an appropriate balance between these functions, recognizing both the rights of property owners to reasonable access and the public purpose of safe and efficient movement of vehicles and pedestrians in an aesthetically appealing environment.

Whenever any property will take vehicular access from East Main Street and within the East Main Street area, the access to the property shall be in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2167 § 7, 2006: Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, certain words and phrases have the following meanings, unless the context otherwise indicates or a definition exists in chapter 18.04 SMC:

“Driveway” means a vehicle access between abutting property and a city right-of-way.

“Joint parking areas” means parking lots that are dedicated to the city for use by the general public and adjacent businesses and lying along a designated cross-access corridor.

“Shared driveway” means a driveway that provides access to more than one property but is not a combined driveway. 

“East Main Street” means that portion of the right-of-way of Main Street beginning at a point 182 feet east of the eastern right-of-way line intersection of Valley Lewis Avenue and proceeding east to a point 658.75 feet west of the western right-of-way line of a 160th Avenue.

“East Main Street area” means the area within the boundaries shown in the East Main Street design strategy and designated as such on the city’s official zoning map.

“New construction, major” means when:

1. The value of new construction, as determined by the building official, exceeds 10 percent of the assessed improvement value of the structure in any 12-month period prior to the new construction; or the new construction increases the total building area by 2,000 square feet, whichever is less; or

2. The new construction results in the conversion of a single-family dwelling to any other use; except, an existing single-family dwelling may add an accessory dwelling unit per SMC 18.16.080(L) without being required to construct the combined driveway; or

3. Construction of a new parking lot that exceeds the threshold in SMC 18.46.080(C). 

“New construction, minor” means development that requires any of the following: 

1. A certificate of occupancy for a change of use per the city’s adopted building code, chapter 15.08 SMC;

4. An increase in the number of spaces of an existing parking lot by an increment greater than 100 percent. (Ord. 2167 § 8, 2006: Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.030 Combined driveways designated.

Combined driveway locations shall be indicated on the official zoning map. This indication shall distinguish those portions of the combined driveways that have been dedicated to the city. Where more than one alternative exists for the future location of a combined driveway, at the time of application for new construction, the community development director, in consultation with the public works director, shall determine, based on the extent and size of the proposed development and the East Main Street design strategy, which alternative or combination of alternatives are best suitable to accommodate future development throughout the city. (Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.040 Required use of combined driveways.

All properties that are designated on the official zoning map as obtaining access to East Main Street via a combined driveway shall use this combined driveway and designated cross-access corridor(s) for future access as new construction occurs. (Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)

B. When minor or major new construction occurs on a property designated with a cross-access corridor but not a combined driveway, the property owner shall be required to grant a shared driveway easement to the public for ingress and egress to the cross-access corridor until a combined driveway is constructed and accessible to adjacent properties. When a combined driveway becomes available as the primary means of access, the shared driveway easement shall be closed per SMC 18.43.050 and vacated within 180 days following notice of the completion of the combined driveway.

C. When minor or major new construction occurs on properties adjacent to a parcel that contains a cross-access corridor easement and a shared driveway easement granting access to East Main Street, but not a combined driveway, the newly developing parcel shall utilize the adjacent parcel’s shared driveway easement for access.

18.43.080 Funding of combined driveways.

A. The city may participate in funding, as based on the city budget, for the construction provided said driveway is constructed to the satisfaction of the city engineer and the combined driveway is dedicated to the city upon completion.

B. All properties that will use the combined driveway for current or future access shall pay a proportionate share of the cost of construction of said combined driveway. This may be paid through a combination of alternatives including, but not limited to, a street assessment reimbursement agreement per chapter 12.14 SMC, SEPA mitigation fees per SMC 16.04.190(F), private agreements between property owners or a private agreement with the city. The city shall only enter into agreements when the combined driveway is dedicated to the city. (Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.090 Cross-access corridors designated.

A. The general location of cross-access corridors shall be indicated on the official zoning map by means of dashed or dotted lines or other suitable symbols. This designation shall be used to show what properties are required to provide a cross-access corridor and not its exact location. This indication shall distinguish those portions of the designated corridor for which easements have been granted from those that have not been granted.

B. At the time of major or minor new construction, the community development director, in coordination with the public works director, shall be authorized to designate the exact location of cross-access corridors on properties within the East Main Street area. (Ord. 2167 § 10, 2006: Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.100 Dedication and construction of cross-access corridors.

A. Wherever a cross-access corridor is designated, no major or minor new construction shall be approved unless the property owner shall grant an easement, running with the land, allowing public ingress and egress from the other properties in the affected area and, where applicable, to East Main Street. Prior to issuance of a building permit for new construction, such easement shall be recorded in the public records of Pierce County and constitute a covenant running with the land. 

B. When major new construction occurs on properties that contain designated cross-access corridors per SMC 18.43.090, the cross-access corridors shall be constructed as a part of parking lot construction.

C. Cross-access corridors shall be designed to provide unified access and circulation within the East Main Street area, in order to assist in local traffic movement. Each designated corridor should be designed to include the following elements:

1. Serve more than one parcel and should be a minimum length of 200 feet and have a design speed of 10 miles per hour;

2. Minimum 24 feet wide to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed for automobiles, service and delivery vehicles including tractor-trailers;

3. Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-access; and

4. Where feasible, link to other cross-access corridors in the area. (Ord. 2167 § 11, 2006: Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.110 Design to accommodate service vehicles.

Cross-access corridors shall allow adequate access for service and loading vehicles, including tractor-trailers, to each business site, and all easements, agreements and stipulations shall so provide. (Ord. 2015 § 7 (part), 2002)


18.43.120 Where unified access and circulation is not practical.

A. The community development director shall be authorized to modify the requirements for cross-access corridors in of this chapter where he/she finds:

1. That abutting properties have been so developed that it is clearly impractical to create a unified access and circulation system within part or all of the affected area;

2. It is reasonable and necessary for the development of the property;

It is the purpose of this chapter to establish review and permit approval procedures for unusual or unique types of land uses which, due to their nature, require special consideration of their impact on the neighborhood and land uses in the vicinity. Administrative uses may be located by special permission of the director, while conditional uses may be located by special permission of the hearing examiner, each under such conditions as the director or hearing examiner may impose. Administrative uses still require a special degree of consideration and control, but due to size, use or location they do not warrant the same process as a conditional use permit. (Ord. 2715 § 2, 2019: Ord. 1694 § 1, 1995)

18.56.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish standard procedures for land use and related decisions made by the city of Sumner or its designated hearing examiner, and to outline the procedure for potential appeals of said decisions. The procedures are designed to promote informed public participation, eliminate redundancy in the permit process, minimize permit review times, and implement the Sumner comprehensive plan. This chapter provides for an integrated and consolidated land use permit process as required by RCW 36.70B.060. (Ord. 2691 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 1762 § 2 (part), 1996)


18.56.020 Land use decision framework.

A. Land use decisions are classified into seven categories based on the amount of discretion and level of impact associated with each decision. Procedures for the seven categories are distinguished according to who makes the decision, the type and amount of public notice required, whether appeal opportunities are provided, which parties have standing for an appeal, and the venue of the appeal. For two of the seven types of decisions, there are additional subtypes which distinguish the venue for an appeal or further review of a decision. Land use decisions are categorized by type in Exhibit 18.56.020A.

B. Type I decisions are made by the director and are appealable only through the judicial system. They require the exercise of little or no discretion. Refer to Exhibit 18.56.020B.

C. Type II decisions are discretionary decisions made by the director following public notice. Type II decisions are not subject to an administrative appeal. These decisions relate to procedural and substantive compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act. Refer to Exhibit 18.56.020C.

D. Type III decisions are discretionary decisions made by the director with an opportunity for an appeal and open record hearing by the applicant to the hearing examiner. Except for Type III.d decisions, there is no public comment period prior to the decision, and appeals from the hearing examiner’s decision shall be made through the judicial system. Certain Type III decisions involving design issues may include advisory review by the design commission. Refer to Exhibits 18.56.020D, E, and F.

E. Type IV decisions are discretionary decisions made by the hearing examiner following a recommendation from city staff and an open record predecision hearing. No administrative appeal is provided, and any appeal from the hearing examiner’s decision shall be made through the judicial system. Refer to Exhibit 18.56.020G.

F. Type V decisions are discretionary decisions made by the hearing examiner following a recommendation from staff and an open record predecision hearing. Type V decisions are appealable only through the judicial system. Refer to Exhibit 18.56.020H.

G. Type VI decisions are discretionary decisions made by the hearing examiner following a recommendation from staff and an open record predecision hearing. Type VI decisions are appealable only through the judicial system. Certain Type VI decisions involving design issues require advisory review by the design commission. Refer to Exhibits 18.56.020I and J.

H. Type VII decisions are legislative decisions made by the city council in its capacity to establish policy and create legislation. The city council will generally seek broad public participation and review by the planning commission or other advisory groups on these decisions. Refer to Exhibit 18.56.020K. (Ord. 2715 § 9, 2019; Ord. 2691 § 1 (part), 2019: Ord. 2472 § 3, 2014; Ord. 1762 § 2 (part), 1996)
