the lot lines or town limit line shall be construed to be the district
boundary line unless otherwise indicated.

Maps do not coincide or approximately coincide with road or street
lines, alley lines or lot lines, and no dimensions are shown, the
location of such district boundary lines shall be determined by the
use of the scale appearing on the map.
e. If, because of error or omission in the Zoning District Map, any
property in the jurisdiction of this Ordinance is not shown as being
in a zoning district, such property shall be classified R-A Low
Density Residence District until changed by amendment.

3. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms
of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, when,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship; provided that the
spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare
secured, and substantial justice done as hereinafter provided.
4. To hear and decide applications for interpretation of the Zoning
District Map where there is any uncertainty as to the location of a
district boundary.
5. To determine, in cases of uncertainty, of the district classification of
any use not specifically named in these regulations; provided, however
such use shall be in keeping with uses specifically permitted in the
districts in which such use is to be classified.
Section 5. Special Exceptions ·
In order to provide for adjustments in the relative locations of uses and buildings of
the same or different classifications, to promote the usefulness of these regulations
as instruments for fact finding, interpretation, application and adjustment, and to
supply the necessary elasticity to their efficient operation, special exceptions and,
limited as to location and especially in locations described in the district regulations
and in this Article, special use and yard exceptions are permitted by the terms of
these regulations. In considering an application for a special exception, the Board
shall give due regard to the specific guides and standards of this Section and those
listed elsewhere in this Ordinance, and in general to the nature and condition of
adjacent uses and structures, and the probable effect upon them of the proposed
exception. It shall also take into account the special characteristics, design,
location, construction, method of operation, effect on traffic conditions, or any other
aspects of the particular use or structure, that may be proposed by the applicant. If
it should fLnd, after the hearing, that the proposed establishment or use will not
adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of persons residing or working on the
premises or in the neighborhood, will not unreasonably impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, nor increase congestion in the streets, nor increase
· . public danger from fire or otherwise unreasonably affect public safety, nor impair the
· character of the district or adjacent districts, nor be incompatible with the general
plans and objectives of the official Comprehensive Plan of the Town of Wise, nor be
likely to reduce or impair the value of buildings or property in surrounding areas, but
that such establishment or use will be in substantial accordance with the general
purpose and objectives of this Ordinance, the Board shall grant the exception and
authorize the issuance, of a special exception permit. In those instances where the
Board finds that the proposed use may be likely to have an adverse effect as above,
the Board shall determine whether such effect can be avoided by the imposition of
any special requirements or conditions with respect to location, design, construction,
equipment, maintenance or operation, in addition to those expressly stipulated in this
Ordinance.

temporary and revocable permit for not more than a 24 month period
subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety
and welfare.

Section 6. Variances
Subject to the provisions of Section 4 of this Article, the Board shall have the power
to grant the following variances:
1. A variation in the yard and lot area requirements in any district so as to
relieve practical difficulties or particular hardships in cases, when a
property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith
and where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size, or
shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the effective date
of this Ordinance, or where by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions of other extraordinary sitwition, or condition of such piece
of property, or the use or development of property immediately
adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of this Ordinance
would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the
property, or where the Board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it,
that the granting of such variance will alleviate a clearly demonstrable
hardship approaching confiscation as distinguished from a special privilege
or convenience sought by the applicant, provided, that all variances
shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of this
Ordinance.
No variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds:
1. That the strict application of the Ordinance would produce undue
hardship.
2. That !;Uch hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity.
3. That the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and thRt the character of the distri·ct
will not be changed by the granting of the variance.
No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds th>'lt the condition or situation
of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or
recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the Ordinance.
Section 7. Conditions Attached to Approvals
Where, in these regulations, special exceptions are permitted, provided they are
approved by the Board where the Board is authorized to decide appeals or approve
certain uses, and where the Board is authorized to approve variances, such approval,
decision, or authorization shall be limited by such conditions as the case may require,
including the imposition of any of the following specifications:
1. No outside signs or advertising structures except professional or
directional signs.

conditions stipulated will be and will continue to be complied with. Any special
exception or varian_ce permit may be authorized and issued for either a limited or an
indefinite period of time and shall be revocable by the Board at any time for failure
to adhere to the applicable conditions. Before revoking any such permit, however,
the Board shall afford the permit holder an opportunity to be heard, giving him at
least five days written notice of the time and place of such hearing, served as
prescribed by Jaw.
Section 9. Lapse of Special Exception or Variance
A ft er the Board of Appeals has approved a special exception or granted a variance,
the special exception or variance so approved or granted shall lapse after the
expiration of one year if no substantial construction or change of use has taken place

granted, or if the Board does not specify some longer period than one year for good
cause shown, and the provisions of these regulations shall thereafter govern.
Section 10. Amendment of Special Exceptions or Variance
The procedure for amendment of a special exception or variance already approved, or
a request for a change of conditions attached to an approval, shall be the same as for
a new application except that where the Administrator determines the change to be
minor relative to the original approval he may transmit the same to the Board with
the original record without requiring that a new application be filed.

Section 11. Procedure on Applications and Appeals
11.l Applications for Special Exceptions
An application to the Board for a special exception permit or other action in
which the Board has original jurisdiction under this Ordinance may be made by
any property owner, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau.
Such application shall be made to the Secretary of the Board on forms which
shall be providgist,,for the purpose, in accordance with rules which shall be
adopted by the Board. All information, including maps and plans required by
such forms, or otherwise required by the Board in order that it might be fully
informed, shall be furnished by the applicant. The Secretary of the Board shall
place the matter on the agenda. Every application or appeal shall be
advertised for a public hearing, said notice to appP.ar '.It least once a week for
two successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town.
Such notice shall specify the time and place of hearing, not less than six days
nor more than 21 days after the second advertisement and the property shall
be posted in accordance with the rules of the Board. The Secretary of the
Board shall also transmit a copy of the application to the Planning Commission
so that the latter, if it finds that the application is related in any way to any
provision or general policy or objective of the Comprehensive Plan or any of
its components, may send a recommendation to the Board based upon such
relationship.
11.2 Appeals
An appeal to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any
officer, department, board or bureau of the Town affected, by any decision of
the Administrator, or from any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by any other administrative officer in the administration or enforcement
of this Ordinance. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the entry of
the decision appealed from by filing with the Administrator, and with the
Board, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Administrator
shall forthwith transmit to the Secretary of the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. An
appeal stays all proceedings in the furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the Administrator certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall
have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a
stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Board or a court of record, on application and on
notice to the Administrator and on due cause shown.
In any case where the Administrator has certified conformity with the
provisions of this Ordinance and a building permit has been issued and
construction of the building for which such permit was issued is subsequently
sought to be prevented, restrained, corrected or abated as a violation of the
zoning ordinance, suit may be filed within 15 days after the start of
construction by a person who had no actual notice of the issuance of such
permit. The Court may hear and determine issues raised in the litigation even
though no appeal was taken from the decision of the Administrator to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.

ARTICLE B
CONDITIONAL USES
Section 1. Purpose of Conditional Use Procedures
cu
Conditional uses are authorized by the terms of this Ordinance. The purpose of the
conditional use procedure is to provide for certain uses which cannot be well adjusted
to their environment in particular locations with full protection offered to surrounding
properties by rigid application of the district regulations. These uses either
have unusual characteristics, or have characteristics which are different from those
of their immediate surroundings, or are generally of a public or semi-public character
and are essential and desirable for the general convenience and welfare, but because
of the nature of the use, the importance of relationship to the Comprehensive Pla[l,
and possible impact, not only on neighboring properties, but on a large section of the
Town, require the exercise of planning judgment on location and site plan. Uses
which require conditio.nal use approval also include those public uses, public utility, or
public service uses upon which the Planning Commission is required to report
following adoption of the Comprehensive Plan under the state enabling statutes, thus
facilitating coordination of the purposes of state planning statutes with those of state
zoning enabling statutes.
Section 2. General Guides and Standards
A conditional use should be approved only if it i.s perrnitt.ed-as-a .. concjitional use in the

$pecffied-in--tl11S-.iGTrcre-orspecHiecrasa-condiffcin of approval, the height limits,
yard spaces, lot area, and sign requirernents shall be the same·as for other uses in the
district in which the proposed conditional use is located.
Section 3. Procedures, Site Plan Required
The procedures for approval of a conditional use are generally the same as those
prescribed for changes and amendments in Article 9, including the public hearing and
report by the Planning Commission, and, in addition the procedures and requirements
for approval of site plans as set forth in Article 10. The area included in an approved
conditional use shall be noted on the Zoning District Map by means of a special
symbol.
Section 4. Existing Conditional Uses
Any use except a mobile home park listed as requiring approval as a conditional use,
and which use or mobile home park legally exists at the effective date of the
regulations of this Article, shall be considered a nonconforming use unless it has been
approved as a conditional use by the Town Council.

regulations unless there is a specific finding by the Planning Commission approved by
the Town Council that compliance with the standard is clearly unnecessary to the
purposes of this Ordinance.

CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS
Section 1. Initiation of Change
Changes
The Town Council may, from time to time, amend, supplement, or change, by
ordinance, the boundaries of the districts or the regulations herein established. Any
such amendment may be initiated by resolution of the Town Council, or by motion of
the Planning Commission, or by petition of any property owner addressed to the Town
Council. Petitions for change or amendment shall be on forms and filed in a manner
prescribed by the Planning Commission. . ·.
Section 2. Report from Planning Commission \
. Before taking any action on any proposed amendment, supplemli"nt, or change, the
Town Council shall submit the same to the Planning Commission for its recommendations
and report. Failure of the Commission to report 90 days after the first meeting
of the Planning Commission after the proposal has been referred to the Planning
Commission shall be deemed approval.
Section 3. Notice and Hearing
The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, before submitting its
report to the Town Council. Notice of public hearings before the Commission shall
be given by publishing the time, place, and nature of the hearing once a week for two
successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the Town,
provided that such notice for both the Planning Commission and the Town Council
may be published concurrently. The public hearing shall be held not less than six nor
more than twenty-one days after final publication. Jn addition, the Commission shall
cause the date, time, place, and nature of the hearing to be posted conspicuously on
the property in accordance with the rules of the Commission and a certificate of
posting shall become a part of the record of the hearing. The published and posted
notices shall contain reference to the place or places within the Town where the
plans, ordinances, or amendments may be examined.
Before approving any proposed change or amendment, the Town Council shall hold a
public hearing thereon, notice of said hearing to be accomplished by publication in a
newspaper as prescribed above. The Planning Commission and the Town Council may
hold a joint public hearing after public notice as set forth hereinabove. If such jpipt
hearing is held then public notice as set forth above need be given only by the Town
Council. If an advertised hearing is continued or deferred, notice shall be repeated
for the new hearing •.
When a proposed amendment involves a change in the zoning classification of
twenty-five or less parcels of land, then, in addition to the advertising as above
required, written notice shall be given at least five days before the hearing to the
owner or owners, their agent or the occupant, of each parcel involved, and to the
owners, their agent or the occupant of all abutting property and property immediately
across the street or road from the property affected; including those properties
which lie in an adjoining jurisdiction. Notice sent by registered or certified mail to
the last known address of such owner as shown on the current real estate tax

assessment books shall be deemed adequate compliance with this requirement. If the
hearing is continued, notice shall be remailed. Costs of any notice hereunder shall be
charged to the applicant.
When a proposed amendment of the zoning ordinance involves a change in the zoning
map classification of more than 25 but less than 500 parcels of land, then, in addition
to the advertising as above required, written notice shall be given by the Planning
Commission at least five days before the hearing to the owner, owners, or their agent
of each parcel of land involved. One notice sent by first class mail to the last known
address of such owner as shown on the current real estate tax assessment books shall
be deemed adequate compliance with this requirement, provided that a representative
of the Commission shall make affidavit that such mailings have been made and
file such affidavit with the papers in the case. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
construed as to invalidate any subsequently adopted amendment or ordinance because
of the inadvertent failure by the representative of the Commission to give written
notice to the owner, owners or their agent of any parcel involved.
Whenever the notices required hereby are sent by an agency, department or division
of the Town such notices may be sent by first class mail, provided, however, a
representative of such agency, department or division shall make affidavit that such
mailings have been made and file such affidavit with the papers in the case.
Section 4. Withdrawal of Application
Applications for a change in zoning shall not be allowed to be withdrawn from
consideration after first notice of a public hearing thereon has been published.
Section 5. Action by the Town Council
The Town Council shall take action on a request for arnendment within one year of
the date of filing; otherwise the amendment shall be deemed approved. In
determining what, if any, amendments to this Ordinance are to be adopted, the Town
Council shall give due consideration to the proper relationship of such amendments to
the entire Zoning Plan and integrity and validity of the zoning districts herein
described, and to avoid isolated unplanned spot-zoning changes in the Zoning District
Map. Any amendments adopted by the Town Council ma}' be modified from the form
in which they were advertised within the limits necessary to relate properly such
amendment or amendments to the zoning plan and Ordinance; provided, however, that
no land may be zoned to a more intensive use classification than was contained in the
public notice without an additional public hearing after notice as required in Section
3 above.
Jn determining what, if any, amendments to the text of this Ordinance or the Zoning
District Map are to be adopted, the Town Council shall recognize that a certain
element of stability is desirable in land use controls and that all citizens have the
right to be treated reasonably; at the same time the Council recognizes in adopting
this Ordinance that conditions and standards will change, and that no citizen has the
right to indefinite continuation of any zoning regulation or classification, and that a
citizen, the Planning Commission, or the Town Council may initiate a change which
they believe will properly adjust the Zoning Ordinance and District Map to the
Comprehensive Plan or changed conditions and standards.

Section 6. Conditional Zoning
6.1 Purpose
Where competing and incompatible uses conflict, traditional zoning methods
and procedures are sometimes inadequate. In such cases, more flexible and
adaptable zoning methods are needed to permit differing land uses and at the
same time to recognize effects of change. It is the purpose of this section to
provide a zoning method as authorized under Sec. 15.1-491, Code of Virginia
1950, as amended, whereby a zoning reclassification may be allowed subject to
certain conditions proffered by the zoning applicant for the protection of the
community even though said conditions may not be generally applicable to land
similarly zoned. While the conditions may vary from property to property by
reason of the nature of the use and different circumstances at a particular
location, it is not the intention of this section to authorize conditions limited
to a particular individual or group, owner or operator, and the provisions of
this section shall not be used for the purpose of discrimination in housing.
6.2 Proffer in Writing
As a part of a petition for rezoning or amendment of the zoning district map
the owner or owners of the property involved may, prior to a public hearing
before the Town Council, voluntarily proffer in writing such reasonable
conditions, in addition to the regulations provided for the zoning district or
districts as herein set forth, as he deems appropriate for the particular case;
provided that:
1. the rezoning itself must give rise for the need for the conditions;
2. such conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning;
3. such conditions shall not include a cash contribution to the Town;
4. such conditions shall not include mandatory dedication of real or
personal property for open space, parks, schools,. fire departments or
other public facilities not otherwise provided for in the subdivision
ordinance;
5. such conditions shall not include payment for or construction of off-site
improvements except those provided for in the subdivision ordinance;
6. no condition shall be proffered that is not related to the physical
development or physical operation of the property; and
7. all such conditions shall be in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan.
For the purpose of this Ordinance, prof erred conditions shall be interpreted to
include written statements, development plans, profiles, elevations, and/or
other demonstrative materials. Materials of whatever nature and intended as
conditions shall be annotated with the following statement signed by the owner
or owners of the subject property: "I (we) hereby proffer that the development
of the subject property of this application shall be in strict accordance with
the conditions set forth in this submission."
9-3
I i
I l '' I
I I
6.3
Changes Cond.
Once proffered and accepted as part of an amendment to the zoning
ordinance, such conditions shall continue in full force and effect until a
subsequent amendment changes the zoning on the property covered by such
conditions; provided, however, that such conditions sball continue if the
subsequent amendment is part of a comprehensive implementation of a new or
substantially revised zoning ordinance.
Review and Revision of Proffered Conditions
Additional conditions or modified conditions may be proffered by the applicant
during or subsequent to the public hearing before the Planning Commission,
provided however that after proffered conditions are signed and made available
for public review and the public hearing before the Town Council has been
advertised (whether or not jointly held with the Planning Commission) no
change or modification to any condition shall be approved without a second
advertised public hearing thereon.
After the Town Council public hearing has been advertised or commenced,
should additional or modified conditions be proffered by the applicant, which
conditions were discussed at the public hearing before the Planning Commission,
then a second public hearing need be held only before the Town Council
before the application and the modified conditions can be approved.
Should additional conditions be proffered by the applicant at the time of the
public hearing before the Town Council, which conditions were not addressed
at the public hearing before the Planning Commission, or if the proffered
conditions are modified beyond the scope of any conditions considered at the
public hearing before the Planning Commission, the application shall be the
subject of a second public hearing before both the Planning Commission and
the Town Council, which hearing may be either separately or jointly held.
6.4 Annotation of Zoning District Map
The zoning district map shall show by an appropriate symbol on the map the
existence of conditions attaching to the zoning on the map. The Administrator
shall keep in his office and make available for public inspection a Conditional
Zoning Index. The Index shall provide ready accP.ss to the ordinance creating
conditions in addition to the regulations provided for in a particular zoning
district. Such conditions shall become a part of the zoning regulations
applicable to the property in question, regardless of changes in ownership or
operation, unless subsequently changed by an amendment to the zoning district
map, and such conditions shall be in addition to the specific regulations set
forth in this Ordinance for the zoning district in question.
6.5 Enforcement of Conditions
The Administrator shall be vested with all necessary authority on behalf of the
Town Council to administer and enforce conditions attached to such rezoning
or amendment to the zoning district map, including: (a) the ordering in writing
of the remedy of any noncompliance with such conditions; (b) the bringing of
legal action to insure compliance with such conditions, including injunction,
abatement, or other appropriate action or proceeding; and (c) requiring a

guarantee, satisfactory to the Town Council, in an amount sufficient for and
conditioned upon the construction of any physical improvements required by
the conditions, or a contract for the construction of such improvements and
the contractor's guarantee, in like amount and so conditioned, which guarantee
shall be reduced or released by the Town Council, or agent thereof, upon the
submission of satisfactory evidence that construction of such improvements
has been completed in whole or in part. Provided, further, that failure to
meet all conditions shall constitute cause to deny the issuance of any of the
required use, occupancy, or building permits, as may be appropriate.
Conformity of Development Plans
Upon approval, any site plan, subdivision plat or development plan thereafter
submitted for the development of the property in question shall be in
substantial conformity with all proffered statements, plans, profiles, elevations,
or other demonstrative materials, and no development shall be approved
by any Town official in the absence of said substantial conformity. For the
purpose of this Section, substantial conformity shall mean that conformity
which leaves a reasonable margin for adjustment to final engineering data but
conforms with the general nature of the development, the specific uses, and
the general layout depicted by the plans, profiles, elevations and other
demonstrative materials presented by the applicant.
6. 7 Change of Approved Conditions
Once conditions have been approved, and there is cause for an amendment
which would not be in substantial conformity with the proffered conditions,
then an application shall be filed for an amendment. If the amendment
concerns an approved site plan, such application shall include the submission
requirements for a site plan set forth in Article 8, except that the Zoning
Administrator may waive any submission requirement if such requirement is
not necessary for an adequate review of the site plan amendment application.
Such amendment shall be the subject of public hearing in accordance with the
requirements for a new application.
6.8 Review of the Administrator's Decision
Any zoning applicant who is aggrieved by the decision of the Administrator
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.5 above may petition the Town Council
for the review of the decision of the Administrator.
Section 7. Reconsideration, One Year Limitation
Whenever a petition requesting an amendment, supplement, or change has been
denied by the Town Council, such petition, or one substantially similar, shall not be
reconsidered sooner than one year after the previous denial.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
Adm in.
Section 1. Enforcement
It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator and such deputies as are appointed by
him to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance and to refuse to issue any permit for
any building, or for the use of any premises which would violate any of the provisions
of said Ordinance. It shall also be the duty of all officers and employees of the Town
to assist the enforcing officer by reporting to him any seeming violation in new
construction, reconstruction, or land uses.
Section 2. Certificate of Occupancy
2.1 No vacant land shall be occupied or used, except for agricultural uses
associated with the conduct of a farm, until a certificate of occupancy shall
have been issued by the Administrator.
2.2 No premises shall be used, and no buildings hereafter erected or structurally
altered shall be used, occupied, or changed in use, until a certificate of
occupancy and compliance shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator,
stating that the building or proposed use of a building or premises complies
with the building Jaws and the provisions of these regulations.
2.3
2.4
Certificates of occupancy and compliance shall be applied for coincident with
the application for a building permit and shall be issued within 10 days after
the erection or structural alteration of such buildings shall have been
completed in conformity with the provisions of these regulations. A record of
all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Administrator.
A certificate of occupancy may be issued for a part of a building or

2.6 A certificate of occupancy shall be required of all nonconforming uses.
Application for a certificate of occupancy for nonconforming uses shall be
filed with the Administrator within 12 months from the effective date of this
Ordinance.
2. 7 The Administrator may issue a temporary and contingent certificate of
occupancy and compliance for a period not to exceed six months where,
because of the unusual nature of the uses, a trial period of operation is in his
opinion the most appropriate way to determine actual compliance .with the
terms of this Ordinance.

Section 3. Permits
3.1 No building shall be erected, constructed, altered, moved, converted,
extended, or enlarged, without the owner or owners first having obtained a
building permit. Such permit shall require conformity with the provisions of
this Ordinance. When issued, such permit shall be valid for a period of six·
months unless a longer period of time is specified thereon in accord with the
terms of this Ordinance.
3.2 No mobile home or trailer or modular home for any purpose shall be placed for
occupancy at any location outside a mobile home park without the owner or
owners first having obtained a placement permit therefor from the Administrator.
Separate permits shall not be required for each mobile home as
authorized in an approved mobile home park or as authorized within the limits
of a mobile home park as established prior to the enactment of applicable
zoning regulations.
3.3 No building permit by the Administrator or other authorized official, lawfully
issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or of any amendment
hereto, and which permit, by its own terms and provisions, is in full force and
effect at said date, shall be invalidated by the p8SS8ge of this Ordinance, or
any such amendment, but shall remain a valid and subsisting permit, subject
only to its own terms and provisions and ordinances, rules, and regulations
pertaining thereto, and in effect at the time of the issuance of such permit;
provided, that all such permits shall expire not later than six months from the
effective date of this Ordinance, unless actual construction shall have
theretofore begun and continued pursuant to the terms of said permit.
Section 4. Plans to Accompany Applications for Permits
All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a drawing or plan in
duplicate or as required by the Administrator showing, with dimensions, the lot Jines,
the building or buildings, the location of buildings on the lot and such other
information as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of these regulations,
including, if necessary and required in a specific case, a boundary survey and a ·
staking of the Jot by a competent surveyor and complete construction plans. The
drawings shall contain suitable notations indicating the proposed use of all land and
buildings, including the number of families or dwelling units or rental units proposed.
A careful record of the original copy of such applications and plans shall be kept in
the 9ffices of the Administrator and a duplicate copy shall be kept at the building at
all times during construction. In a particular case, the Administrator may waive the
requirement for plans when such plan is clearly unnecessary to a decision or the
record on the case.
Section 5. Site Plan Review - Procedures Generally
Where certain uses require review and approval of site plans meeting the requirements
of this Ordinance, the procedure for processing site plans varies depending on
the agency assigned responsibility for preliminary and final approval as follows:
1. Administrative Site Plan Review to be conducted by the Planning
Commission with preliminary and final approval by the Commission.
10-2
Admin. Site Pi.
Unless specifically stated to the contrary, administrative site plan
review is intended. An appeal from the Commission's decision may be
taken to the Town Council, in which case the deCision of the Town
Council would be final. Site plans in this category are generally for
uses having a more limited area of impact or uses where the basic
policy decision regarding general appropriateness of the use has been
made by the terms of the district regulations and the remaining
responsibility is to insure careful design and compatibility with neighboring
conditions in accordance with the terms of the Ordinance.
2. Site Plan Approval by the Town Council after Report by the Planning
Commission. These site plans generally cover uses having impact on a
substantial area, public and semi-public uses generally covered in the
Comprehensive Plan, and uses the appropriateness of which involves a
major planning policy decision. Such uses include those listed as
conditional uses.
In all cases the review begins with the Administrator. Where a subdivision is also
involved, the review of subdivision plans and site plans will be coordinated under the
provisions of this Article and the requirements of the subdivision regulations.
Generally, approval is required first for preliminary plans followed by approval of
final plans which agree with approved preliminary pl;ms and conditions attached
thereto. Where a project is large enough that accomplishment by stages is
appropriate the site plan will generally be subject to preliminary and final approval
with plans in three forms: 1) general site plan for the overall project, which is called
an overall project design; 2) detailed site plans for development units or stages as
they are to be developed; 3) detailed engineering drawings for development units or
parts thereof as they are to be developed. An overall project design would include
generally the same items as specified for preliminary site plans but with detail
modified as appropriate to the scale of the project.
Section 6. Requirements for Site Plans, Content and Form
6.1 Preliminary Site Plans
The preliminary site plans shall be clearly drawn to scale as specified below
and shall show the following:
1. The proposed title of the project, owner or owners of the land, and
name of the engineer, architect, designer, or landscape architect, and
the developer.
2. The north point, scale, and date.
3. Location of the project by an insert map at a scale of not Jess than one
inch equals two thousand feet, indicating the scale, the north arrow,
and such information as the names and numbers of adjoining roads,
streams and bodies of water, railroads, subdivisions, towns, and magisterial
districts or other landmarks sufficient to clearly identify the
location of the property.

proposed reservations for parks, parkways, playgrounds, school sites,
and open spaces.
11. Location with respect to each other and to lot lines, number of floors,
number of dwelling uni ts and approximate height of all proposed
buildings and structures, necessary and main, or major excavations.
12. Preliminary plans and elevations of the several dwelling types and other
buildings, as may be necessary.
13. General location, height, and material of all fences, walls, screen
planting, and landscaping.

signs.
15. A tabulation of the total number of dwelling units of various types in
the project and the overall project density in dwelling units per acre,
gross or net as required by district regulations.
The Administrator may establish additional requirements for preliminary site
plans, and in special cases, may waive a particular requirement if, in his
opinion, the inclusion of that requirement is not essential to a proper decision
on the project. Site plans may be prepared on one or more sheets to show
clearly the information required by this article and to facilitate the review
and approval of the plan. If prepared in more than one sheet, match Jines shall
indicate where the several sheets join. Each plan sheet shall reserve a blank
space three inches wide and five inches high for the use of the approving

2. All existing and proposed water and sanitary sewer facilities indicating
all pipe sizes, types and grades and where connection is to be made to
the County or other utility system.
3. Provisions for the adequate disposition of natural and storm water in
accordance with the; duly adopted design criteria and standards of the
Town indicating the location, sizes, types and grades of ditches, catch

the proposed temporary and permanent control practices and
measures which will be implemented during all phases of clearing,
grading, and construction.
4. Existing topography with two-foot contour intervals or such intervals as
approved by the Administrator. Where existfog ground is on a slope of
Jess than two percent, either one-foot contours or spot elevations
where necessary, but not more than fifty feet apart in both directions.
5. Proposed finished grading by contours supplemented where necessary by
spot elevations.
Section 7. Procedures, Administrative Site Plan Review
7.1 When these regulations require site plan review for certain major uses for
which Town Council action is not required, including certain major uses as
listed in Section 5 of Article 6 and not otherwise listed as conditional uses,
five copies of a preliminary site plan for any of the specified uses shall be
submitted to the Administrator for review of the plans for compliance with
these regulations and the requirements for preliminary site plans and who shall
transmit said plans to the Planning Commission for review at the next regular
monthly meeting of the Commission if plans are submitted 21 days prior to
said meeting.
The applicant is advised to review his plans in general or sketch form with the
Administrator prior to drafting for submittal to the Planning Commission.

natural environment, the preservation of trees or historic sites, provision for
open space, and in general with the objective of insuring a durable, harmonious,
and appropriate use of the land in accord with the objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan. Except as specified below, no public hearing shall be
required. The plans shall be returned to the applicant within 10 days following
the Commission meeting as approved, approved subject to conditions, or
disapproved. Unless otherwise specified, approval shall be valid for a period of
one year prior to issuance of building permits.
7.3 If specified conditions are met in revised plans, the Administrator may
approve issuance of building permits accordingly, and may approve additional
minor changes, if, in the opinion of the Administrator such changes do not
substantially affect the original approval or conditions attached thereto.
Other changes and amendments may require return of the site plan to the
Planning Commission or such other procedures under this Ordinance as the
case may require •
. 7.4 The applicant shall submit written proof of notification of all adjoining
property owners as to the nature of the propos8l and where site plans may be
viewed. No site plan shall be approved within five days of any such notice.
7.5 In any case where the Administrator is of the opinion that a proposed project
subject to administrative site plan review is of such scale and impact that a
decision on the site plan should be reached only after a public hearing thereon,
the Administrator may schedule such hearing before the Planning Commission
in accordance with the procedures and notice specified for such hearings in the
rules of the Commission. The applicant shall submit evidence that all adjacent
property owners have been notified of the nature, time and place of the public

TITLE, PURPOSE, APPLICA T!ON AND INTERPRETATION
Section l. Title
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the Subdivision Ordinance of the
Town of Wise, Virginia.
Section 2. Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish certain subdivision standards and
procedures for the Town of Wise, Virginia, as provided for by the 1950 Code of
Virginia, as amended.
These are part of a long-range plan to guide and facilitate the orderly beneficial
growth of the community, and to promote the public health, safety, convenience,
comfort, prosperity and general welfare. More specifically, the purposes of these
standards and procedures are to provide a guide for the change that occurs when
lands and acreage become urban in character as a result of development for
residential, business, or industrial purposes; to provide assurance that the purchasers
of lots are buying a commodity that is suitable for development and use; and to make
possible the provision of public services in a safe, adequate and efficient manner.
Subdivided land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and
streets must be maintained and numerous public services customary to urban areas
must be provided. This Ordinance assists the community in meeting these responsibilities.
Section 3. Application and Interpretation
This Ordinance shall apply to the incorporated area of the Town of Wise in the

Section 1. Streets and Alleys
1. The subdivision layout shall conform in all essential respects with the official
Major Thoroughfare Plan and other aspects of the adopted Comprehensive Plan
for the Town.
2. The street layout shall be designed to create desirable building sites while
respecting topography, minimizing street grades, avoiding excessive cuts and
fills, and preserving trees and other natural features to the maximum extent
possible.
3. Proposed streets in the subdivision shall provide for the continuation of
existing, planned, or platted streets on adjacent tracts, unless such continuation
shall be prevented by topography or other physical condition, or unless such
extension is found by the Planning Commission to be unnecessary for the
coordination of development between the subdivision and such adjacent tract.
4. Where the Planning Commission deems it desirable or necessary to providing
access to adjacent tracts not presently subdivided, proposed streets in the
subdivision shall be extended to the boundary lines with such adjacent tracts,
and temporary turnarounds shall be provided at the ends of such streets, by
means of temporary easements or otherwise.
5. Where the subdivision abuts or contains a primary highway as designated on the
Major Thoroughfare Plan, the Planning Commission may require that measures
to be taken to reduce the impact of heavy traffic on the residential lots
abutting or fronting upon such highway and to afford separation of through and
local traffic, through one of the following means:
a. By providing v_ehicular access to such Jots by means of a service drive
separated from the major thoroughfare by a planting strip and connecting
therewith at infrequent intervals.
b. By designing reverse frontage lots having access only from a parallel
minor street or from cul-de-sac or loop streets, and with vehicular access
to such Jots from the major thoroughfare prohibited by deed restrictions
or other means.
The choice of the most appropriate method of accomplishing the desired
purpose in a specific instance shall be made by the Planning Commission,
giving consideration to topography and other physical conditions, the
character of existing and contemplated development in the subdivision
and its surroundings, and other pertinent factors.

'
E. encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
F. encourage useriforiowers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and ·
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening,
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
G. enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly,
effectively, and efficiently;
H. consider the public health and safety of communication towers;
I. avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.

ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any
antenna, that is under fifty (50) feet in height and is owned and
operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is
used exclusively for receive only antennas.
C. Preexisting Towers or Antennas. Preexisting towers and preexisting
antennas shall not be required to meet the requirements of this
ordinance, other than the State and Federal Requirements and
Building Codes and Safety Standards Sections of this ordinance.
D. AM Array. For purposes of implementing this ordinance, an AM array,

array. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the
AM array by right.
6.3 General Requirements.
A. Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be
considered either principal or accessory uses. A different
existing use of an existing structure on the same lot shall not
preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot.
B. Lot Size. For purposes of determining whether the installation
of tower or antenna complies with district development
regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements,

and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use
materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will
blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings.
E. Installation on Existing Structure. If an antenna is installed on a
structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting
electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color
that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related
equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
F. Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required
by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required,
the Planning Commission and/or Town Council may review the
lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause
the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
G. No advertising or signs of any type shall be allowed on any
monopole or tower.

and regulations are changed, then the owners of the monopoles or towers
governed by this ordinance shall bring such structures into compliance
with such revised standards within six (6) months of effective date of such
standards or regulations unless a different compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring
monopoles or towers into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the monopole or
tower at the owner's expense.
6.5 Building Codes and Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
monopoles or towers, the owner of such shall ensure that it is constructed
and maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable

standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries
Association as amended from time to time. A statement of compliance
must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator by the owner. If, upon
inspection by the Zoning Administrator or his designated representative,
the Administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes
and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon
notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty
(30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.
Failure to bring tower into compliance within thirty (30) days shall
constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's
expense.
6.6 Not Essential Services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and
permitted pursuant to this ordinance and shall not be regulated or
permitted as essential services, public utilities or private utilities.
6.7 Permitted Uses. Telecommunications structures to include monopoles
and towers, with related unmanned equipment building(s) shall be

iii. The antenna complies with all applicable
building codes.
2. Antennas on existing towers. An antenna which is
attached to an existing tower may be approved by the
Zoning Administrator and, to minimize adverse visual
impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of
towers, collocation of antennas by more than one carrier
on existing towers shall take precedence over the
construction of new towers, provided such collocation is
accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
a. A tower which is modified or reconstructed to
accommodate the collocation of an additional
antenna shall be of the same tower type as the
existing tower, unless the Zoning Administrator
allows reconstruction as a monopole.
b. Height - An existing tower may be modified or
rebuilt to a taller height only one time per
communication tower, not to exceed thirty (30) feet
over the tower's existing height, to accommodate
the collocation of an additional antenna. The
additional height shall not require an additional
distance separation. The tower's premodification
height shall be used to calculate such distance
separations.
c. Onsite location - A tower which is being rebuilt to
accommodate the collocation of an additional
antenna may be moved onsite within fifty (50) feet
of its existing location. After the tower is rebuilt to
accommodate collocation, only one tower may
remain on the site. A relocated onsite tower shall
continue to be measured from the original tower
location for purposes of calculating separation
distances between towers. The onsite relocation
of a tower which comes within the separation
distances to residential units or residentially zoned
lands shall only be permitted when approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
Information Required -All uses. The following information is required by
the applicant for both permitted and conditional uses. This information is

emitted from the facility will not result in a level of
exposure at any point beyond the property line of the
facility which exceeds the lowest applicable exposure
standards established by any regulatory agency of the
federal government or by the American National
Standards Institute. Exceptions to this requirement
may be authorized by the Administrator for low power
transmission facilities such as two-way radio, telephone
(cellular and VHF), microwave, government

The purpose of this district is to provide standards and regulations of flood
plain management in order that the Town may be eligible for Federal
Insurance under the national Flood Insurance Program of the Federal
Insurance Administration (FIA), and to adopt the criteria and standards set
forth in the Federal Register of October 26, 1976, Part II. The Flood Plain
District shall include all areas subject to inundation by the waters of the
One Hundred Year (100 year) Flood. The source of this delineation shall
be the Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Wise, Virginia, as prepared
by the Federal Insurance Administration, dated February 1980, as
amended. The Flood Plain District shall be deemed an overlay on any
existing, or hereafter established, zones or districts within the Town of
Wise, Virginia.
9.2 Subdistricts of the Flood Plain District
The flood Plain District shall be comprised of two (2) subdistricts as
follows:
(1) Floodway (F-1) is delineated for purposes of this Ordinance using
the criteria that a certain area within the.flood plain must be capable
of carrying the waters of the one hundred (100) year flood without
increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one
(1) foot at any point. These areas included in this District are
specifically defined in Table 3 of the above referenced Flood
Insurance Study and shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary
and Floodway Map.
(2) Floodway Fringe (F-2) shall be that area of the 100 year flood plain
not included in the Floodway District. The boundaries of this
District are shown on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map;
however, the exact outermost boundary shall be the 100 year flood
elevations contained in the flood profiles of the above referenced
Flood Insurance Study.
9.3 Amendments and Modifications to the Delineation of the Flood Plain
District
The delineation of the Flood Plain District may be revised, amended and
modified by the Town Council in compliance with the National Flood
Insurance Program when:
(1) there are changes through natural or other causes;
(2) changes are indicated by future detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
studies and/or;
(3) when social and economic factors favor a realignment.
All such changes shall be subject to the review and approval of the
Federal Insurance Administrator.
All such changes shall be referred to the Town of Wise, Virginia Planning
Commission pursuant to Section 15.2-2285 of the Code of Virginia, and
after a public hearing as provided by Sections 15.2-2204 and 15.2-2206 of

Zoning Appeals within the designated floodway if any increase in flood
levels during the base flood discharge would result.
B. Variances may be issued by the Board of Zoning Appeals for new
construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in
conformance with the procedures of this Ordinance.
C. Variances and/or Special Exceptions shall only be issued by the Board of
Zoning Appeals upon:
3. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
4. A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant,
and
5. A determination that granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats
to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of
the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
D. Variances and/or special exceptions shall only be issued upon
determination that the variance and/or special exceptions are the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard to afford relief.
E. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to
construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance, such construction below base flood
level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions.
F. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall maintain a record of all variance
actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such
variances issued in its annual report submitted to the Federal Insurance

sought by the provisions of this Ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of
study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This Ordinance does not imply that areas
outside the flood plain districts, or that land uses permitted within such
districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This Ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Wise,
Virginia, or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder. The Town Manager is designated as agent for the Town of
Wise, Virginia to execute all documents and enter into all contracts with
reference to emergency assistance under the Emergency Disaster Act, the
State Emergency Services and any other agency of the Federal Government
and the State of Virginia under the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency
Services and Disaster Law of 1973.
