2-10-107 Bid Processes.

Purchases for the City shall be made by the Purchasing Agent pursuant to one (1) of the bid processes outlined in this Section. Section 2-10-108 establishes when each of the bid processes described in this Section may be used. The City shall substantially comply with the following guidelines for the specific bid process used:

(1)    Competitive Sealed Bidding.

(a)    Description. Competitive sealed bidding is a procedure in which vendors or contractors are invited to submit formal bids to provide a designated product or to complete a designated project in accordance with specifications provided by the City.

(b)    Appropriateness. Competitive sealed bidding is generally appropriate for all types of procurements. When contractor quality is a prime concern in awarding a project bid, the City may pre-qualify bidders according to a policy established by the Purchasing Agent.

(c)    Notice Inviting Bids Issued. The City shall provide notice of its invitation for bids.

(i)    Notice includes a general description of the articles to be purchased or the work to be performed, the location where bid blanks and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening bids.

(ii)    Except as otherwise permitted or provided by this Chapter, the Purchasing Policy Manual, or other applicable law, notice of a call for bids shall be made public in a manner permitted by the Purchasing Policy Manual at a reasonable time prior to the time set for bid opening. The bid package shall state requirements to which the bidder must respond.

(d)    Bid Procedure.

(i)    Sealed bids (or electronically submitted bids) shall be submitted as designated in the notice with the statement “Bid for (item or project)” on the envelope (or in the electronic transmission).

(ii)    Bids shall be opened (or read, in the case of electronically submitted bids) in public at the time and place stated in the public notice.

(iii)    Bids submitted to the City shall be evaluated on the basis of compliance with specifications and other relevant criteria.

(e)    Bid Award.

(i)    Springville City may reject any or all bids submitted.

(A)    If Springville City rejects all bids submitted but still intends to undertake the purchase, Springville City shall again request bids by following the procedure provided in subsection (1)(d) of this section.

(B)    If, after twice requesting bids by following the procedure provided in subsection (1)(d) of this section, Springville City determines that no satisfactory bid has been submitted, the City Council may undertake the purchase as it considers appropriate.

(ii)    If the City elects to proceed with the purchase or project, bids shall be awarded to the lowest responsive responsible bidder. “Lowest responsive responsible bidder” means a vendor or contractor who:

(A)    Has submitted a bid in compliance with the invitation to bid and within the requirements of the plans and specifications;

(B)    Is the lowest bidder that satisfies Springville City’s criteria relating to financial strength, past performance, integrity, reliability, and other factors that Springville City uses to assess the ability of a bidder to perform fully and in good faith the contract requirements;

(C)    Has furnished a bid bond or equivalent in money as a condition to the award of a prime contract; and

(D)    Furnishes a payment and performance bond as required by law.

(2)    Requests for Proposals.

(a)    Description. Requests for proposals (RFPs) are invitations for suppliers or contractors to submit a proposal on a specific product or service. The City awards the contract for the product or service based on criteria set forth in the request for proposals.

(b)    Appropriateness. RFPs may be used when required by law, or when the Purchasing Agent determines that the use of formal competitive bidding is either impractical or not advantageous to the City. In making this determination, the Purchasing Agent shall consider factors such as:

(i)    Whether there may be a need for price and service negotiation;

(ii)    Whether there may be a need for negotiation during performance of the contract;

(iii)    Whether the relative skills or expertise of the offerors will have to be evaluated;

(iv)    Whether cost is secondary to the characteristics of the product or service sought, as in a work of art;

(v)    Whether the conditions of the service, product or delivery are unable to be sufficiently described in the invitation for bids;

(vi)    Whether the City is requesting the offeror to propose a method or strategy for completing the project; and

(vii)    Whether there may be a need to negotiate completion times related to the project.

If the City is requesting a price to complete an already designed project or to purchase a specific product(s), it will generally be more appropriate to use the competitive sealed bids procedure rather than the request for proposals procedure.

Professional services will generally be procured through the request for proposals procedure. Professional services include the following: accounting, auditing, architecture, banking, insurance, engineering, appraisal, legal, court reporter, medical, education, research, consulting, and other services where the professional qualifications of the contractor are of prime importance. Professional service contracts shall be awarded based on professional qualifications, experience, willingness and ability to meet the City’s specific service requirements, cost of service, and other criteria deemed important by the Purchasing Agent.

(c)    Notice.

(i)    Proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals.

(ii)    Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given.

(d)    Request for Proposals. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluating factors.

(e)    Opening of Proposals. Proposals shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of contents to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit the City from allowing or accepting electronically submitted proposals.

(f)    Revision of Proposals.

(i)    As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of assuring full understanding of, and responsiveness to, solicitation requirements.

(ii)    Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and revision may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers.

(iii)    In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.

(g)    Award.

(i)    Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into consideration price, the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals, and other criteria set forth herein.

(ii)    Springville City may reject any or all proposals submitted.

(A)    If Springville City rejects all proposals submitted but still intends to undertake the purchase, Springville City shall again request proposals by following the procedure provided in subsection (2)(c) of this section.

(B)    If, after twice requesting proposals by following the procedure provided in subsection (2)(c) of this section, Springville City determines that no satisfactory proposal has been submitted, the City Council may undertake the purchase or contract as it considers appropriate.

(C)    Open Market Procedure.

(1)    Price Quotations. Purchases shall, whenever possible, be based on at least three (3) bids (price quotations) and shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder.

(2)    Request for Quotations. Bids (price quotations) shall be solicited from prospective vendors by written or oral request.

(3)    Records. The person soliciting the price quotations shall keep a record of quotations solicited, including vendor names, date of solicitation and price quoted, and shall include this information with the purchase order.

(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11/02/2010)


2-10-108 Choice of Bid Process.

Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter or by provisions of State or Federal law, purchases of supplies or services shall follow one (1) of the bid processes outlined below for the appropriate dollar amount. The cost of the supply or service shall not be divided to avoid bid requirements. In cases where more than one (1) alternative is listed as acceptable for a given dollar amount, any of the listed alternatives shall be acceptable, and the City shall not incur any liability for choosing one (1) alternative over another.

(1)    Supplies and Contractual Services Having an Estimated Value in Excess of $25,000.00. Purchases of supplies or contractual services having an estimated value in excess of $25,000.00 shall be pursuant to one (1) of the following procedures:

(2)    Supplies and Contractual Services Having an Estimated Value between $1,000.00 and $25,000.00. Purchases of supplies or contractual services having an estimated value of greater than $1,000.00 but less than or equal to $25,000.00 shall be pursuant to one (1) of the following procedures:

(a)    Formal competitive bidding.

(b)    Request for proposals.

(c)    Open market procedure.

(3)    Supplies and Contractual Services Having an Estimated Value of $1,000.00 or Less. Whenever the supplies or contractual services have an estimated value of $1,000.00 or less, the City need not follow any formal bid procedure, but shall seek to obtain the best price possible.

(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11/02/2010)


2-10-109 Exceptions to Bidding Requirements Set Forth in Section 2-10-108.

The bid process requirements set forth in Section 2-10-108 do not apply in the following situations:

(1)    Sole Source Procurements. Sole source procurement may be used only if the Purchasing Agent determines that a service, product, or requirement is reasonably available only from a single supplier or contractor. Examples of circumstances which may necessitate sole source procurement are:

(a)    If there is only one (1) vendor or supplier who can provide the needed product or service;

(b)    If the compatibility of supplies, accessories, replacement parts, or service is the paramount consideration;

(c)    If a sole supplier’s product is needed for trial use or testing;

(d)    If the City is procuring utility services;

(e)    If the City seeks to add to, repair or maintain supplies owned by the City which may be more efficiently added to, repaired or maintained by a particular person or firm; and

(f)    If the City seeks supplies which, by reason of the training of City personnel or the inventory of replacement parts maintained by the City, are more compatible with the existing supplies owned by the City and if the supplies can only be acquired from a sole source.

The justification for sole source procurement shall be included in the procurement documentation. The Purchasing Agent may establish policies governing the negotiation of sole source procurements.

(2)    Library Purchases. The purchase of library books, records, tapes, films, publications, periodicals, and subscriptions are specifically exempted from competitive bidding requirements, but the City shall make a good faith effort to obtain the best price possible for these purchases as determined by the Purchasing Agent.

(3)    Auction, Closeout, Bankruptcy Sales. If the Purchasing Agent determines that supplies can be purchased at any public auction, closeout sale, bankruptcy sale or other similar sale, and if the Purchasing Agent finds that a purchase at any such auction or sale will be made at a cost below the market cost in the community, a contract or contracts may be let, or the purchase made, without complying with the competitive bidding requirements of this Chapter.

(4)    Exchanges. Exchanges of supplies between the City and any other public agency which are not by sale or auction shall be by mutual agreement of the respective public agencies.

(5)    Projects Performed by City Employees. City employees may be used to complete City projects; provided, that the City complies with State statutory requirements governing contracts for municipal public improvements.

(6)    State Contract. The City may purchase supplies from the vendor who has submitted the lowest bid price for such items to the State of Utah Purchasing Office (or any agency of the Federal government) at the quoted price, without any solicitation or price quotation or invitation to bid. For such purposes, the quoted price shall be deemed to be the lowest price available for such items and the City need not follow any other bidding requirements.

(7)    Utah Correctional Industries Division. Goods and services produced by the Utah Correctional Industries Division may be purchased from the Utah Correctional Industries Division without following any of the bidding requirements set forth herein.

(8)    Unsuccessful Competitive Sealed Bidding. If the bids received in response to a competitive sealed bid process are unreasonable, noncompetitive, or in excess of available funds, and if the City Administrator determines that time or other circumstances will not permit the delay required to resolicit competitive sealed bids, the City may procure the needed goods or services using the emergency procurement procedure.

(9)    Internet Auction Sites. The City may acquire supplies from Internet auction sites without following formal purchasing procedures if the City Administrator determines that there is an established market price for the supplies and that the supplies can be acquired less expensively from an Internet auction site.

(10)    Used Supplies. The City may acquire used supplies without following formal purchasing procedures if the City Administrator determines that there is an established market price for the used supplies and that it is beneficial for the City to acquire the used supplies.

(11)    Ongoing Construction Work. If a contractor has been hired to work in a given area by a person or entity other than the City, and if the City has work that needs to be completed in the area, and if the City Administrator determines that there is an established price for the type of work that the City needs completed and that the City can save on mobilization costs by hiring the contractor that is already in the area, then the City may negotiate with and contract directly with the contractor without following formal purchasing processes.

(12)    Purchases by Other Governmental Entities. If another governmental entity has, after a competitive process, awarded a bid to purchase supplies from a particular vendor within the preceding one hundred eighty (180) days, the quoted price may be deemed to be the lowest price available for such items and the City need not follow formal purchasing procedures.

(14)    Donated Funds. In cases where a donor or grantor has contributed funds to the City, the City may expend the funds in the manner designated by the donor or grantor in lieu of the procedures set forth in this Chapter.

2-14-101 Policy Considerations.

There is an underlying policy in the City strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending litigation alleging such issues. At the same time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property and the public’s right to require the dedication or exaction of property consistent with the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the State of Utah must be preserved. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist the City, its officials, employees, boards, commissions and councils in considering decisions that may involve constitutional takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This chapter is further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by property owners that a specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet preserve that ability of the City to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other duties and functions.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 1-95)


2-14-102 Definitions.

(1)    “Constitutional taking” means any action by the City involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property that may require compensation to the owner of that property because of: (a) the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United State of America; (b) Article One, Section Twenty-Two of the Constitution of the State of Utah; or (c) any court ruling governing the physical taking or exaction of private real property by a governmental entity.

(2)    Actions by the City involving the physical taking or exaction of private real property is not a constitutional taking if the physical taking or exaction bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest and is roughly proportional and reasonably related, on an individualized property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the proposed development on the legitimate government interest.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 1-95)


2-14-103 Guidelines Advisory.

The guidelines adopted and decisions rendered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter are advisory, and shall not be construed to expand or limit the scope of the City’s liability for a constitutional taking. The reviewing body or person shall not be required to make any determination under this chapter except pursuant to Section 2-14-104.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 1-95)


2-14-104 Review of Decision.

Springville City residents may keep honeybees on their property in accordance with this Chapter. Beekeepers shall register with and obtain any necessary licenses from the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food for beekeeping and shall follow all City ordinances and State and Federal laws and regulations that govern and regulate beekeeping, such as those found in Title 4, Chapter 11 of the Utah State Code.

(Ord. No. 22-2016 § 2, 10/04/2016)

Each beekeeper shall maintain his or her beekeeping equipment in good condition, including keeping the hives painted if they have been painted but are peeling or flaking, and securing unused equipment from weather, potential theft or vandalism and occupancy by swarms. It shall not be a defense to this Article that a beekeeper’s unused equipment attracted a swarm and that the beekeeper is not intentionally keeping bees.

(4)    Water Supply. A supply of fresh water shall be maintained on owner’s property where it is readily accessible for bees to prevent them from congregating at neighboring swimming pools or other sources of water on nearby properties.

(5)    Removing Swarm(s). If a beekeeper serves the community by removing a swarm or swarms of honeybees from locations where they are not desired, the beekeeper shall not be considered in violation of this Article limiting the number of colonies if the beekeeper temporarily houses the swarm on the apiary lot in compliance with the standards of practice set out in this Article for no more than thirty (30) days from the date acquired.

Such flyway shall consist of a solid wall, a fence, dense vegetation, or a combination thereof, and must extend at least ten feet (10') beyond the hive in each direction so that honeybees are forced to fly to an elevation of at least six feet (6') above ground level over property lines in the vicinity of the apiary. Such flyway may not violate any other provisions in the Springville City Code.

(4)    Schools/Public Parks. Beehives may not be located within one hundred feet (100') of a school property or a public park.

(Ord. No. 22-2016 § 2, 10/04/2016)


3-7-906 Unlawful Conduct.

In carrying out that responsibility, the Superintendent shall cause culinary water system surveys and inspections of water users’ culinary distribution systems to be conducted by individuals deemed qualified by the Superintendent and representing the City Water Division. Records of such surveys and inspections shall indicate compliance with the health and safety standards listed in subsection (1) of this section. All such records shall be maintained by the Water Division. The Superintendent shall notify all culinary water users in writing of the need for the periodic system survey to insure compliance with existing applicable health and safety standards. Based upon the result of such surveys and inspections, the Superintendent shall select and approve a back flow prevention assembly for the culinary service connection of any water user as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent.

(3)    It shall be the responsibility of a culinary water user to purchase, install, test, and maintain any back flow prevention assembly required to comply with this Section.

(4)    The responsibility of the building inspector charged with enforcement of the plumbing code adopted by Title 10 shall begin at the downstream side of each culinary water meter and continue through the length of each water user’s culinary water system. The building inspector will review all plans to ensure that unprotected cross connections are not a part of the culinary water user’s system. If a cross connection cannot be eliminated, it shall be protected by installation of an air gap or an approved back flow prevention assembly in accordance with the plumbing code. The culinary water user’s system shall be installed so that water vacating the culinary water system must do so through an approved air gap or approved mechanical back flow prevention assembly properly installed in accordance with the plumbing code. All surveys, tests, repairs, or maintenance of back flow prevention assemblies, whether done by a water user or by the Water Division, shall be performed by a certified technician, certified by the State of Utah Division of Drinking Water. The technician shall have the following responsibilities:

(a)    To ensure that acceptable testing equipment and procedures are used for testing, repairing or overhauling back flow prevention assemblies.

(b)    To make reports of such testing and repair to the water user, Water Division, and the State on forms approved for such use by the State and within the time limits prescribed by the State. The report shall include the list of materials or replacement parts used.

(c)    To ensure replacement parts are equal in quality to parts originally supplied by the manufacturer of a back flow prevention assembly being repaired.

(d)    To not change the design, material, or operational characteristics of a back flow prevention assembly during testing, repair or maintenance.

(e)    To ensure that testing equipment being used is acceptable to the State and is in proper operating condition.

(f)    To be equipped with, and be competent to use, all necessary tools, gauges, and other equipment necessary to properly test and maintain back flow prevention assemblies.

(g)    To attach to each back flow prevention assembly tested, a tag showing the serial number, date tested, name of technician, and technician’s license number.

(5)    No culinary water service connection to any premises from the City culinary water system shall be made or maintained except in compliance with this Section and all other applicable State laws, regulations, and codes. If the Superintendent of the Water Division finds that a back flow prevention assembly required by this Section is not installed, tested, or maintained; or that a back flow prevention assembly has been removed or bypassed; or an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises; or the periodic system survey of a water user’s culinary water system has not been conducted, he shall give written notice of such violation to the water user. If the violation is not corrected within ten (10) days after the date of such written notice, service of culinary water to that water user shall be disconnected and shall not be restored until the violation is corrected. A water user’s system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to the Superintendent of the Water Division or his authorized agent to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of this Section exist, and to audit the results of the required survey. If the Superintendent deems a service connection to be a significant hazard to the culinary water supply of the City, an approved back flow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of that water user’s system, at or near the property line, or immediately inside the building being served, but, in all events, upstream of the first branch line leading off the service line. The Superintendent shall have the authority to specify the type of back flow prevention assembly required. All such assemblies shall be approved back flow assemblies. Provided, however, all back flow prevention assemblies which are installed prior to the effective date of this Section which do not meet the requirements of this Section, but were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements of this Section, be excluded from the requirements of this subsection (5) so long as the Superintendent is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the City culinary water system. If an existing back flow prevention assembly is moved from its present location or requires more than minimum maintenance, or if the Superintendent finds that the operation or maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, it shall be replaced by an approved back flow prevention assembly.

(6)    The culinary water user at any premises where a back flow prevention assembly is installed shall have surveys and inspections and operational tests made by certified technicians at least once per year at the water user’s expense. If the Superintendent deems it necessary to protect the public health, he may require such surveys, inspections, and tests at a more frequent interval. The Superintendent shall see that all such tests are made according to standards set forth by the State. Each back flow prevention assembly shall be tested within ten (10) working days of the initial installation. No back flow prevention assembly shall be installed so as to create a safety hazard.

(7)    The following definitions shall apply to this Section:

(a)    “Approved back flow prevention assembly” shall mean a back flow prevention assembly accepted by the State as meeting an applicable specification or as suitable for the proposed use.

(b)    “Back flow” shall mean the reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back pressure or back siphonage.

(c)    “Back pressure” shall mean the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under pressure into the feeding distribution pipes of the culinary water supply system from any source other than the intended source.

(d)    “Back siphonage” shall mean the flow of water, or other liquids, mixtures, or substances into the distribution pipes of the culinary water supply system from any source other than the intended source, caused by reduction of pressure in the culinary water supply system.

(e)    “Back flow prevention assembly” shall mean a device or means designed to prevent back flow. Specifications for back flow prevention assemblies shall be those contained within the Utah Plumbing Code and the Cross Connection Control Program for Utah which has been adopted by the State.

(f)    “Contamination” shall mean a degradation of the quality of the culinary water supply by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials.

(g)    “Cross connection” shall mean any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluid or other material of nonpotable quality to come in contact with potable water inside a distribution system. This shall include any temporary connections such as swing connections, removable connections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change over devices or sliding multiport tubes or other plumbing arrangements.

(h)    “State” shall mean the Utah Department of Health, Bureau of Drinking Water/Sanitation, except as otherwise indicated by the context.

The person working on trees on a street, highway, or public area shall be required to remove all debris from the rights-of-way by sunset of the same day, unless specifically authorized to do otherwise by the Director of Buildings and Grounds or designee. The acceptable standard shall be a broom clean finish or better.

(9)    Planting Season. Planting season for trees planted along streets, in rights-of-way, in landscape borders, in parks, or City maintained properties is September 1st through May 31st. This will ensure a higher survival rate of new trees. Plantings planned outside of the planting season must acquire written approval of the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, before proceeding.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 3-06; Ord. No. 03-2012, 03/06/2012)


4-11-104 Removal of Trees.

(1)    Permit Required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, partnership, corporation or organization of any kind to prune or remove any tree or shrub upon any public street or on any City-owned property within the City without first having obtained a written permit from the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee. Any such permit shall state specifically the work to be done under it, and shall expire thirty (30) days after the date of its issue.

(2)    Removing Stumps. Any tree, tree stump or shrub that shall be removed from any of the public streets or places within the City shall be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the level of the ground, unless permission to leave a projecting stump is granted by the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee.

(3)    City Authority. The City may condemn and remove, or order the removal of, any tree, tree stump, shrub, or plant upon any of the public streets or on City-owned property within this City where the same is dead, diseased or for any reason whatsoever is deemed undesirable or unsafe by the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee. The City shall have the authority to condemn and remove, or order to be removed, any tree, tree stump, shrub, or plant upon private property when the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, shall find such action necessary for public safety or to prevent the spread of disease or insects to public trees and places.

A permit is not required for removing sucker growth, water sprouts, minor limbs causing obstructions, or for removal of less than ten percent (10%) of the tree canopy.

(3)    Removal. Any property owner desiring to remove a tree from the park strip or easement abutting his property shall make application to the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee. The Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, shall determine whether or not such tree is required to be retained in order to preserve the intent and purpose of the Street Trees Program. In making this determination the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, shall consider the inconvenience or hardship which retention of the tree would cause the property owner, and consider also the condition, age, desirability of tree species and location. If the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, finds that the tree may be removed without violating the intent and spirit of the Street Tree Plan, he may schedule the removal by City personnel or the property owner to remove such tree at the property owner’s own expense and liability, providing that any trees removed shall be replaced by street trees as approved by the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee.

(4)    Replacement. Any replacement shall be made based on evaluation by the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, of the condition of the site to determine whether replacement is warranted. If a permit is granted for removal of a street tree, all removal work shall be completed within sixty (60) days from the date of issuance of the permit and shall be under the general supervision of and in accordance with the Street Tree Program. All removal permits shall be null and void after the expiration of sixty (60) days from the date of issuance, unless extended by the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee.

(5)    Considerations. In determining whether a tree may be removed and replaced, the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee, shall consider, among other things, the following:

(a)    Whether the tree or trees pose a potential for safety problems despite a sound maintenance program;

(b)    Whether the roots from adjacent park strip trees are interfering with sewer lines servicing the abutting property to the extent that the property owner requires frequent repair of said sewer lines;

(c)    Whether the tree is dead, dying or incurably diseased;

(d)    Whether the tree is diseased and weakened by age, storm, fire or other injuries so as to pose a danger to persons, property, improvements or other trees;

(e)    Whether the tree(s) is of an undesirable species;

(f)    Whether the tree poses a hardship to the adjacent property owner such as, but not limited to, the cracking or raising of a garage floor or, in the case of a handicapped person, special circumstances exist which cause the location of the tree to become a hindrance for vehicle and handicapped access; and

(g)    Whether removal is necessary for construction of a street widening or other public improvement project, or necessary street or public improvement repair work.

(6)    Exceptions. Street trees or other plantings which are required to be planted by a responsible developer, City crews or City contractor may be planted without a permit; provided, however, that such trees and plantings shall conform to such plans and specifications and shall be planted under the supervision of the Director of Buildings and Grounds, or designee.

4-12-103 STORM SEWER UTILITY CREATED.

There is hereby created and established a Storm Sewer Utility and service charge rate structure. The Utility will have regulatory authority and responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance, administration and operation of all City storm sewer conveyances and facilities.


4-12-104 OWNERSHIP OF CITY STORM SEWER FACILITIES AND ASSETS.

The City shall determine which of the City’s storm sewer assets will be transferred to the Utility. Until such transfer, the Utility shall operate, maintain and improve all existing City storm sewer facilities used for the conveyance of storm waters, through, under or over lands or watercourses, beginning at a point where the storm waters first enter the storm sewer system of the City and ending in each instance at a point where the storm waters exit from the system. Storm sewer facilities do not include government-owned streets or those storm sewer facilities operated and maintained by, or for, the Utility, the County or the State of Utah.


4-12-105 UTILITY ADMINISTRATION.

The Storm Sewer Utility shall be administered by the City’s Public Works Director.


4-12-106 SERVICE RATES AND FEES IMPOSED.

The City Council shall, from time to time by resolution, establish such rates and fees as it deems proper for the storm sewer utility services provided by the City and the uses made thereof. It shall be unlawful for any person, after any utility has been turned off from his or her premises on account of non-payment of service fees or other violation of the rules, regulations, or ordinances pertaining to the storm sewer services, to turn on or allow the utility to be turned on or used, without authorization from the City Treasurer and the Director. 


4-12-107 SYSTEM OF RATES AND FEES

(1)    Service fees imposed. The City will impose storm sewer fee rates and fees on each parcel of real property within the City except governmentally-owned streets and storm sewer facilities operated and maintained by, or for, the Storm Sewer Utility, the County or the State of Utah. The fees shall fund the administration, planning, design, construction, water quality programming, operation, maintenance and repair of the existing and future storm sewer system.

(2)    Methods of determining contribution of storm water.

(a)    Contributions of storm water from non-residential parcels and residential parcels larger than duplexes have been ascertained through aerial photography by evaluating land surface and measuring the amount of impervious surface.

(b)    Contributions of storm water from residential parcels have been established by estimating residential impervious areas.

(3)    Method of determining service fee rates: Storm sewer service fees shall be applied to each parcel of real property within the City (including City-owned properties), except government-owned streets and State or County storm water facilities. Service fees shall be established as provided for in title 4-10-106 of this Code and may be differentiated according to the following classifications:

(a)    Residential parcels: Single-family residential and duplex parcels shall constitute one ERC per month.

(b)    Undeveloped parcels: Undeveloped parcels shall have no charges applied.

(c)    Other parcels: Charges for all other parcels shall be computed by multiplying the total ERCs for a parcel by the monthly rate. Total ERCs are calculated by dividing total square feet of impervious surface by 3,800 (one ERC).

(d)    Credit for on-site mitigation: A service charge credit shall be available for those non-single family residential customers that exceed the City’s storm water development standards and/or reduce the City’s downstream costs in providing storm water capacity, provided that, if the City’s standards are increased in the future, then only those customers who currently exceed the existing standards will continue to be eligible for a service charge credit. If a request for mitigation credit is granted, the credit shall be applied to all charges from the time of the credit request being accepted by the City, and will be reflected on the next billing thirty days after appeal is granted.

Storm water control facilities located on a parcel may either hold runoff for a period of time and release it at a controlled rate to the storm sewer system (detention), or hold water until it evaporates or infiltrates into the ground (retention). 

Credit for improving quality of storm water runoff will be based on implementation of source or treatment controls which reduce or eliminate pollutants from its storm water runoff before it enters the City storm sewer system. 

Customers who believe their site conditions warrant a service charge credit may make application to the City by requesting an application package from the Public Works Director or his designee, provided that no credit shall exceed a 35% reduction of the original service charge amount. 


4-12-108 BILLING AND COLLECTION.

(1)    Utility Enterprise Fund – This ordinance creates the Storm Sewer Utility Fund. All revenues received from storm sewer user fees shall be placed in the enterprise fund as a designated fund, to be left separate and apart from all other City funds. The collection, accounting, and expenditure of all Storm Sewer Utility funds shall be in accordance with the Utah Uniform Fiscal Procedures Act.

(Ord. No. 22-2017 § 3, 10/17/2017)


4-12-109 APPEAL OF CHARGES.

Any non-residential customer who disagrees with the storm sewer user fee for his or her parcel may apply to the Director for a user fee adjustment. The adjustment request must state the grounds for adjustment and must be filed in writing with the Director no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of billing. The Director shall review the request and basis for user charges to determine whether an error was made in the calculation or application of the fee. The Director may approve an adjustment to the fee.

An appeal of a Director’s decision may be brought before the City Administrator within thirty (30) days after the date of the Director’s decision. Decision of the City Administrator shall be final and conclusive.

If an appeal of charges is successful, credit will be applied to all charges from the time of the appealed billing, and will be reflected on a future billing after the appeal is granted. 


4-12-110. NO POLLUTED WATERS DISCHARGED TO STORM SEWERS.

The only substance allowed to be discharged under this chapter into the City’s storm sewer system is storm water, surface drainage, subsurface drainage, groundwater, roof runoff, cooling water or non-polluted water.

The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW Manager within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the City performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling at the user’s facility between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. If the City performs the sampling and analysis and a violation occurs, in lieu of the user performing the sampling and analysis, then the City will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)


4-14-709 Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.

(1)    Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 4-14-705. The notification requirement in this Section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections 4-14-701, 4-14-703, and 4-14-704.

(2)    Users are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.

(3)    In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the POTW Manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.

(4)    In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

(5)    This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.

(a)    Except as indicated in subsections (1)(b) and (c) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Manager. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.

(b)    Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

(c)    For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety (90) day compliance reports required in Sections 4-14-701 and 4-14-703, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data does not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the POTW Manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 4-14-704, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

Article 12 – Judicial Enforcement Remedies


4-14-1201 Injunctive Relief.

When the POTW Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the POTW Manager may petition the Fourth District Court through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this Chapter on activities of the user. The POTW Manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)


4-14-1202 Civil Penalties.

(1)    A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

(2)    The POTW Manager may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.

(3)    In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.

(4)    Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)


4-14-1203 Criminal Prosecution.

(1)    A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one hundred eighty (180) days, or both.

This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under State law.

(3)    A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this Chapter, individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one hundred eighty (180) days, or both.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)


4-14-1204 Remedies Nonexclusive.

The remedies provided for in this Chapter are not exclusive. The POTW Manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan. However, the POTW Manager may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW Manager is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)

Article 13 – Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations


4-14-1301 Upset.

(1)    For the purposes of this Section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

(2)    An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) of this section are met.

(3)    A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that:

(a)    An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

(b)    The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

(c)    The user has submitted the following information to the POTW Manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days):

(i)    A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(ii)    The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

(iii)    Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

(4)    In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

(5)    Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.

(6)    Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)


4-14-1302 Prohibited Discharge Standards.

A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 4-14-301(1) or the specific prohibitions in Sections 4-14-301(3)(b), (d) through (h), and (j) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:

(1)    A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or

(2)    No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)


4-14-1303 Bypass.

(1)    For the purposes of this Section:

(a)    “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.

(b)    “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. “Severe property damage” does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

(2)    A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (3) and (4) of this section.

(3)    Bypass Notifications.

(a)    If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.

(b)    A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW Manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW Manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.

(4)    Bypass.

(a)    Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW Manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

(i)    Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

(ii)    There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

(iii)    The user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) of this section.

(b)    The POTW Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW Manager determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (4)(a) of this section.

(Ord. No. 07-2014, 03/19/14)

5-6-106 Historic Sites List.

(1)    There is hereby established a Springville Historic Sites List. The Landmarks Preservation Commission may designate any building, structure, or site to the Historic Sites List if such building, structure, or site meets the following standards:

(a)    It is located within the boundaries of the City.

(b)    The building or structure is at least fifty (50) years old.

(c)    It retains its historic integrity, in that there are no major alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant historic features of the site. Major alterations that would destroy the historic integrity include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof, enlargement or enclosure of windows on the principal facades, addition of upper stories or the removal of original upper stories, covering exterior walls with non-historic materials, moving a building or structure from its original location to one that is dissimilar to the original, or additions which significantly attract from or obscure the original form and appearance of the building or structure when viewed from the public streets.

(d)    It has been documented according to Utah State Historic Preservation Office standards for intensive level surveys and copies of such documentation have been filed with the Landmarks Preservation Commission and in State historic preservation files.

(2)    Any person, group, or government agency may nominate a property for listing in the Springville Historic Sites List. The procedure for nominating and listing such a property is as follows:

(a)    Nomination shall be by letter together with duplicate copies of completed intensive level survey documentation for each property submitted to the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

(b)    The Landmarks Preservation Commission shall review and consider such nomination at its next scheduled meeting. The Commission shall notify the nominating party, either orally or in writing, one week prior to the meeting that the nomination to the Historic Sites List will be considered and shall place that item on the agenda posted for the meeting. The one-week notification period may be waived by the nominating party. The Landmarks Preservation Commission shall not, however, review any nomination which is submitted less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the meeting.

(c)    The Landmarks Preservation Commission shall review the documentation for completeness, accuracy, and compliance with the standards set forth in subsection (1) above.

(d)    If the Landmarks Preservation Commission determines that the nomination is proper and complete, that the standards set forth in subsection (1) above have been met, and that the building, structure, or site is a significant historic resource of the community, it shall place the building, structure, or site on the Springville Historic Sites List.

(3)    The owner of a property listed on the Historic Sites List may obtain a Historic Sites Certificate from the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

(4)    If a building, structure, or site listed on the Historic Sites List is to be demolished or extensively altered, efforts shall be made to document its physical appearance before such action takes place. To assist such documentation, the City shall delay issuing a demolition permit, building permit, or excavation permit for the property for a period of one week after application for the permit is submitted. The building inspector shall notify a member of the Landmarks Preservation Commission of the application for the demolition, building, or excavation permit. It shall then be the responsibility of the Landmarks Preservation Commission to document the property. Documentation shall include exterior photographs of the Historic Building and when possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the building in order to provide an accurate floor plan drawing. After expiration of the one-week period, the demolition, building, or excavation permit may be issued whether or not the Landmarks Preservation Commission has documented the property. The permit may be issued before expiration of the one-week waiting period if the building inspector is notified by the Landmarks Preservation Commission that its documentation has been completed. All such documentation will be kept in the Commission’s Historic Sites files, which shall be open to the public.

(5)    If the Landmarks Preservation Commission determines that a property no longer meets the standards for designation to the Historic Sites List, it shall remove the property from the Historic Sites List.

(1979 Code 5-6-4; adopted by Ordinance No. 21-89, amended by Ordinance No 26-06)


5-6-107 Historic Landmark Register.

(b)    It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places or has been officially determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under applicable federal regulations.

(c)    The property must have been associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of the community’s history; or associated with the lives of persons significant in the community’s history; or embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in history or prehistory.

(d)    The owner or owners of the property have given written approval for designation of the property to the Historic Landmark Register.

(2)    The procedure for designation of a property to the Historic Landmark Register is as follows:

(a)    The owner of the property shall submit a written request for designation to the Chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The letter shall identify the property by its address and historic name, give the date the property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places or officially determined eligible for such listing, and include a verification that the owner holds the legal title to the property.

(b)    Upon receipt of the written request for designation, the Chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission shall arrange for the nomination to be considered at a meeting of the Commission within thirty (30) days from the date the nomination was received.

(c)    At its meeting, the Commission shall evaluate the nomination based upon standards set forth in subsection (1) above. The Commission shall forward its recommendation with regard to placing the property on the Historic Landmark Register to the City Council within fourteen (14) days after the meting of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

(d)    The City Council shall consider the recommendation of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and may, by approval and passage of an appropriate resolution, designate the property to the Historic Landmark Register.

(e)    Designation of a property to the Historic Landmark Register may be amended or rescinded in the same manner as in original designation.

(f)    The Landmarks Preservation Commission shall cause a document certifying designation of a property to the Historic Landmark Register to be recorded with the County Recorder’s Office.

(3)    When a property has been designated to the Historic Landmark Register, such designation shall have the following effects:

(a)    Owners of such property may seek assistance from the Landmarks Preservation Commission in applying for grants or tax credits for rehabilitating their property.

(b)    Proposed repairs, alterations or additions to Historic Landmarks are subject to review by the Landmarks Preservation Commission and subsequent review and approval by the City Council. Such review is to insure the preservation of historic features to the greatest possible degree. Applications for demolition, building, or excavation permits pertaining to Historic Landmark property shall be forwarded by the building inspector to the Landmarks Preservation Commission prior to the issuance of any such permit. At its next scheduled meeting, the Landmarks Preservation Commission shall review the applications and proposed work for compliance with Section 5-6-106. The Commission’s recommendation with regard to any such application shall be forwarded within ten (10) days to the City Council for its consideration. Copies of the recommendation shall be sent to the building inspector and property owner. The City Council shall schedule the matter for its next regular meeting and upon review of the Landmarks Preservation Commission’s recommendation and other information given at the meeting, shall make a decision regarding the appropriateness of the proposed permits. Approved projects shall be issued a Certificate of Historical Appropriateness which authorizes the building, demolition, or excavation permit to be issued.

(4)    The provisions of subsection (3) above are subject to enforcement in the same manner as the building code adopted by Title 10 of this Code.

(1979 Code 5-6-5; adopted by Ordinance No. 21-89, amended by Ordinance No 26-06)


5-6-108 Standards for Rehabilitation.

The following standards shall be used by the Landmarks Preservation Commission and City Council when determining if a property should be placed on the Historic Landmark Register and in making an evaluation of a project pursuant to Section 5-6-105(3)(b):

(1)    A reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or site and its environment.

(2)    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features shall be avoided.

(3)    All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations which have no historic basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.

(4)    Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected.

(5)    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated appropriately.

(6)    Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material shall match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.

(7)    Surface cleaning of the structure shall be undertaken by the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods which will damage historic building materials shall not be used.

(8)    A reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any rehabilitation project.

(6)    (a)	After the hearings have been completed, the board shall consider all facts and arguments presented and shall make such corrections in any proposed assessment as it may consider just and equitable.

(3)    After such fifteen (15) day period and if the ordinance levying the assessment so provides, all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property (but only in their entirety) may be paid prior to the dates on which they become due. Any such prepayment must include an additional amount equal to the interest which would accrue on the assessment to the next succeeding date on which interest is payable on any special improvement bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of the assessments, plus such additional amount as, in the opinion of the City Council or of any officer of the City designated by the City Council, is necessary to assure the availability of money to pay interest on the special improvement bonds as interest becomes due plus any premiums which may become payable on redeemable bonds which may be called in order to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance.

(3)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), if before the final date that payment may be legally made under a final sale or foreclosure of property to collect delinquent assessment installments, the owner pays the amount of all unpaid installments that are past due and delinquent with interest at the rate determined by the City Council to date of payment plus all approved or required costs, the owner shall then be restored to the right to pay in installments in the same manner as if default had not occurred.

An assessment or any part or installment of it, any interest accruing on the assessment, and the penalties and cost of collection of the assessment shall constitute a lien on and against the property upon which the assessment is levied on the effective date of the ordinance levying the assessment. This lien shall be superior to the lien of any trustee, mortgage, mechanic’s or material man’s lien, or other encumbrance, and shall be equal to the lien for general property taxes. Such lien shall apply without interruption, change in priority, or alteration in any manner to any reduced payment obligations and shall continue until the assessment, reduced payment obligation, and any interest, penalties and costs on them are paid, notwithstanding any sale of the property for or on account of a general property tax, special tax, or other assessment or the issuance of an auditor’s deed, an assignment of interest by the county, or a sheriff’s certificate of sale or deed.

(b)    Format: (i) Such electronic database, whether provided by the State or the designated database provider, shall be provided in a format approved by the American National Standards Institute’s Accredited Standards Committee X12, which, allowing for de minimis deviations, designates for each street address in the City, including, to the extent practicable, any multiple postal street addresses applicable to one street location, the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, and the appropriate code identified by one nationwide standard numeric code.

(ii)    Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each street address with respect to political subdivisions that are not jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing jurisdiction.

(iii)    The nationwide standard numeric codes shall contain the same number of numeric digits, with each digit or combination of digits referring to the same level of taxing jurisdiction throughout the United States, using a format similar to FIPS 55-3 or other appropriate standard approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission or their successors.

(4)    Procedure If No Electronic Database Provided. (a) Safe Harbor. If neither the State nor the designated database provider provides an electronic database, a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the City that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect jurisdiction, if the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific jurisdiction and exercises due diligence to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code. Any enhanced zip code assignment changed is deemed to be in compliance with this section. For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if the home service provider demonstrates that it has:

(i)    Expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;

(ii)    Implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions; and

(iii)    Used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.

(b)    Termination of Safe Harbor: The “Safe Harbor” subsection above applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of the “Safe Harbor” subsection with respect to a state for which an electronic database is not provided, until the later of:

(i)    Eighteen (18) months after the nationwide standard numeric code has been approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission; or

(ii)    Six (6) months after the State or a designated provider in the State provides such database.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 25-00)


6-11-106 Place of Primary Use.

(1)    A home service provider is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer’s place of primary use. Subject to the “Requirement to Maintain Electronic Database or Enhanced Zip Code Listing” section above, and if the home service provider’s reliance on information by its customer is in good faith, a home service provider:

(a)    may rely upon the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider’s customer.

(b)    is not liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate address under existing agreements.

(2)    A home service provider may treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect two (2) years after the date of this amendment to this ordinance as that customer’s place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdiction to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile telecommunication services are remitted.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 25-00)


6-11-107 Tax Against Customer.

Each customer shall accurately report the customer’s place of primary use. The customer shall be liable for any taxes not paid by the home service provider as a result of the customer’s failure to accurately report the customer’s place of primary use.

Article 1 RESIDENTIAL SOLICITATION


7-6-101 Purpose.

Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City has a substantial interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity. 

There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this Chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of City officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding Door-to-Door Solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by Door-to-Door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in Door-to-Door Solicitation, the City adopts this Chapter to promote the City’s substantial interests in: 

(1)    Respecting citizen’s decisions regarding privacy in their residences; 

(2)    Protecting persons from criminal conduct; 

(3)    Providing equal opportunity to Advocate for and against Religious Belief, Political Position, or Charitable Activities; and

(4)    Permitting truthful and non-misleading Door-to-Door Solicitation regarding lawful Goods or Services in intrastate or interstate commerce. 

The City finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this Chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the City interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated.

(3)    Those Responsible Persons or Entities associated with Registered Solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the City, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed place of business in the City.

11-2-306 Variances.

(1)    Definition – A variance is a device that grants a property owner relief from certain provisions of the zoning ordinance when, because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the property, compliance would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from an inconvenience or a desire to reduce financial difficulties.

(2)    Any person or entity desiring a waiver or modification of the requirements of the zoning ordinance as applied to a parcel of property that he owns, leases, or in which he holds some other beneficial interest may apply to the Board of Adjustment for a variance from the terms of the zoning ordinance.

(3)    The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance only if:

(b)    There are special circumstances attached to the property that do not generally apply to other properties in the same district;

(d)    The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and will not be contrary to the public interest; and

(e)    The spirit of the zoning ordinance is observed and substantial justice done.

(4)    In determining whether or not enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection (3)(a), the Board of Adjustment may not find an unreasonable hardship unless the alleged hardship:

(a)    Is located on or associated with the property for which the variance is sought; and 

(b)    Comes from circumstances peculiar from the property, not from conditions that are general to the neighborhood.

(5)    In determining whether or not enforcement of the zoning ordinance would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection (3)(a), the Board of Adjustment may not find an unreasonable hardship if the hardship is self-imposed or economic.

(6)    In determining whether or not there are special circumstances attached to the property under subsection (3)(b), the Board of Adjustment may find that special circumstances exist only if the special circumstances:

(a)    Relate to the hardship complained of; and

(7)    The applicant shall bear the burden of proving that all of the conditions justifying a variance have been met.	

(8)    Variances run with the land.

(9)    The Board of Adjustment and any other body may not grant use variances.

(10)    In granting a variance, the Board of Adjustment may impose additional requirements on the applicant that will:

(11)    If a variance is granted by the Board of Adjustment, alterations must begin six months from the date the variance is granted, otherwise, the variance shall be null and void. The Board of Adjustment may grant one six (6) month extension if the petitioner can show adequate cause that circumstances necessitate a time extension.

(4)    The Board of Adjustment shall transmit to the reviewing court the record of its proceedings including its minutes, findings, orders, and if available, a true and correct transcript of this proceedings.

(5)    Review of the board of Adjustment’s decision shall be done by the court in the manner and upon the standards provided by the law.

(6)    The filing of a petition for review by the District Court does not stay the decision of the Board of Adjustment. Before filing the petition for review, the aggrieved party may petition the Board of Adjustment to stay its decision. Upon receipt of a petition for a stay, the Board of Adjustment may order its decision stayed pending District Court review if the Board of Adjustment finds it to be in the best interest of the City.

Article 2 – NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, LOTS AND USES


11-3-201 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose of this Article is to establish regulations governing legally established buildings, lots and uses and other nonconformities that do not conform to the applicable requirements of this Title. The intent of this article is to recognize the legitimacy of buildings, lots and uses legally established during the history of Springville while recognizing the need to protect conforming development and to promote orderly development and improvement of the City. 


11-3-202 Determinations of Nonconformities of Buildings, Lots and Uses.

All matters regarding the nonconformities shall be determined by the Board of Adjustment, unless otherwise specified in this Title. Upon application, the Board or its designee shall determine if the building, lot or use is nonconforming with respect to the current provisions of this Chapter. 


11-3-203 Nonconformities Resulting from Public Action.

When an area or yard setbacks of a legally established lot are reduced as the result of conveying land to a federal, state or local government for a public purpose, such lot and yards shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot size and yard setback standards without any need for a variance.


11-3-204 Nonconforming Buildings or Structures.

(1)    Ordinary Maintenance or Repair. A nonconforming building may be maintained or repaired so long as it does not increase the nonconformity of the building.

(2)    Additions or Enlargements. A nonconforming building may be enlarged or altered, provided that the proposed changes are in conformance with the current zoning ordinance. In addition, the Board, after a public hearing, may allow an enlargement which does not conform to height, lot coverage, setbacks or area requirements, based on the following determinations:

(a)    Granting the expansion will not adversely impact the attainment of the Springville City General Plan;

(b)    The expansion will improve the general appearance or safety of the area;

(c)    The expansion will not adversely impact the character of the neighborhood;

(d)    The expansion will improve the area by providing additional or adequate parking;

(e)    Any expansion will be adequately screened or buffered, if needed, so as not to increase impacts on the adjoining properties

(3)    Nonconforming Use Expansion Limits. A nonconforming use may not expand into any enlarged or altered portion of a nonconforming building.

(4)    Damage or Destruction. A nonconforming building, that is damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, earthquake, wind or other natural disaster may be restored or rebuilt; provided that a building permit is obtained within six months of the event and that restoration is diligently pursued to completion. The overall floor area of a nonconforming building may be increased provided no additional nonconformities are created.

(5)    Loss of Nonconforming Rights. A building or structure nonconforming as to the setback, lot coverage, height restrictions or other relevant zoning regulations, shall lose its nonconforming rights at the time the building is demolished, renovated to be conforming or removed from the site. 


11-3-205 Nonconforming Uses.

(1)    Right of Use. The lawful nonconforming use of a building, structure, or land existing at the time the applicable zoning regulations became or become effective may be continued.

(2)    Limits to Expansion of Use. A nonconforming use may be expanded through the same building in which it is located, provided no structural alteration of the building is proposed or made for the purpose of the extension. For purposes of this subsection, the addition of a solar energy device to a building is not a structural alteration. A nonconforming use may not be expanded on a lot. 

(3)    Discontinuance or Abandonment. If a nonconforming use located in a conforming building, structure or lot is discontinued for a period of one year or more, the building, structure or lot shall only be occupied by a use that is in conformance with the present use regulations of the zone in which it is located. 

(4)    Change to Another Nonconforming Use Prohibited. A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use.

(5)    Change to a Conforming Use. Once any part of a building or lot, serving as the location of a nonconforming use, has been used by a conforming use, that location may not be used by the previous or any other nonconforming use. 

(6)    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, a building legally built and occupied as a single-family dwelling that is currently located in a non-residential zoning district, may be repaired, altered, enlarged or replaced provided that any changes do not increase any building or lot nonconformities, no additional dwelling units are added and all required permits are obtained. For purposes of this provision, the R-1 development standards of the 1949 Springville City Zoning Ordinance shall apply.


11-3-206 Nonconforming Lots of Record.

(1)    Right of Use. A nonconforming lot may continue to be occupied and used, although it may not conform in every respect with the dimensional and area requirements of this Chapter. The nonconforming lot shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter.

(2)    Loss of Nonconforming Rights. A nonconforming lot shall lose its status at such time as it is combined with an adjacent lot.

(3)    New Construction or Additions on Residential Nonconforming Lots of Record. A building permit may be issued for a single family dwelling or changes to an existing single family dwelling in any zone allowing such use; provided, that the development regulations, exclusive of lot width and area, of the current Zoning Ordinance shall be met.

(Ord. No. 06-2012, 07/17/2012)


11-3-207 Determination of Nonconforming Status – Effect of Determination.

(1)    Procedure. The Zoning Administrator or the Administrator’s designee shall determine the existence, expansion or modification of a nonconforming building, lot or use or other nonconformity as provided in the following procedure:

(a)    If a determination of the nonconforming status of a property is desired, the owner or his designee shall submit a completed application for a Certificate of Nonconformity with the Community Development Department. In all cases, the property owner shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that a building, lot, use or other circumstance, which does not conform to the provisions of this Title, complied with the applicable ordinance requirements in effect at the time the current circumstances were originally created.

(b)    A preponderance of evidence is evidence which is more credible and convincing than evidence offered in opposition to it.

(c)    Evidence offered to prove a building, lot, use or other circumstance was legally created may include, but not be limited to:

(i)    The date when the circumstance was created;

(ii)    Copies of applicable zoning, building or other Code provisions in effect at the time of creation;

(iii)    Documents showing the nonconforming circumstance was authorized, such as a building permit, letters, and meeting minutes of governmental bodies where the circumstance was discussed or authorized;

(iv)    Property inspection reports which indicate the degree that the nonconforming circumstance complies with the applicable Codes in effect at the time of creation; and

11-4-102 Purpose of Zoning Districts. Revised 12/19

In addition to the more general purposes of this Title identified in Section 11-1-102, the various zoning districts each serve a more specific individual purpose, as described below. All of the districts combined provide for a broad range of uses that are essential to the creation of a safe, healthy, diverse and economically viable Springville City.

(1)    The Agricultural Zoning Districts are intended to preserve the City’s agricultural land uses until urban uses become desirable and feasible, based on the availability of urban services in the area.

(a)    The A-1 Zoning District is intended to allow for the continued agricultural uses in those areas of the City which have been historically used for the growing of crops and the raising of livestock.

(b)    The A-S Zoning District is intended to allow for the continued agricultural uses, along with specialty agricultural uses, in those areas of the City which have been historically used for the growing of crops and the raising of livestock.

(2)    The Residential Zoning Districts (R) are intended to provide a range of densities which will reflect the diverse needs and desires of people for housing in Springville City. These areas are to include attractive landscaped yards. All of these zones include front and rear yard setbacks to provide space for landscaping, parking and accessory uses. These districts also allow for other compatible uses that may complement the primarily residential functions of the districts, under certain conditions. Basic urban services and utilities should be available in all of these zones. These zones are intended to accommodate both pedestrian and vehicular traffic and function as neighborhoods for people residing in these zones.

(a)    The R1-15 zoning district is intended to provide areas for very low density, suburban-type uses. Street access in this zone should primarily be off of local and residential collector streets. This zone will allow farm animals as an accessory use, provided adequate lot area exists.

(b)    The R1-10 and R1-8 zoning districts are intended to provide areas for single family detached dwellings at a low density and are generally suburban in nature. Street access in this zone should primarily be from local and residential collector streets.

(c)    The R1-5 zoning district is intended to provide an area for single family residences in detached, and in limited circumstances, attached dwellings in a medium low density. The zone is specifically designed to meet the unique nature of the Historic City Center area which historically included deep lots with limited frontage, located on a traditional grid street pattern and is generally urban in nature.

(d)    The R2 zoning district is intended to provide for single family and two family residences in attached and detached dwellings at a medium low density and is generally urban in nature. Street access for residents in this zone should primarily be from local and residential collector streets.

(e)    The RMHP zoning district is intended to provide areas for mobile home parks and subdivisions, which are limited in use to manufactured housing and related uses of an office and a community/recreation center. Because of the required size of these developments, area zoned for this use should have immediate access to a collector or arterial street.

(f)    The RMF zoning districts are intended to provide areas for multiple-family attached dwellings at medium (RMF-1) to medium high (RMF-2) densities. These zones should include a variety of residential flats and multi-level rowhouses with parking generally located behind or on the side of the buildings. Single and two family residences are also allowed in these zones. Primary access to the units should face the street and vehicular access should generally be from collector and local streets. Uses in the RMF zones are urban in nature, due to their densities. This zone should typically abut an arterial or collector street or abut higher intensity uses and serve as a transition zone to lower density residential zones.

(3)    Professional Office and Business Park Zoning Districts are intended to provide space for a wide range of offices and institutions that meet needs of the community by providing places for professional services and employment opportunities. Primary frontage and access should be located on arterial or collector streets in these zoning districts.

(a)    The PO zoning district is intended to provide space for personal and professional offices and institutions that meet the need generated by the community to utilize their services. The intensity of use, in terms of hours of operation and number of customers should generally be less than commercial types of uses and these uses should generally be located along the edges of neighborhoods on collector and arterial streets.

(b)    The BP zoning district is intended to be an attractive campus environment for offices, research facilities an environmentally-appropriate assembly uses, as well as appropriate amenities supporting employee activity. Uses receiving site plan approval for this zone should be compatible with surrounding uses, which should be accomplished through attractive architectural design, pedestrian trails and substantial, attractive landscaping.

(4)    The Center Zoning Districts are intended to provide locations for pedestrian-oriented, vertical mixed-use development throughout the City.

(a)    The VC zoning district is intended to provide opportunities for mixed-use development throughout the City. These districts would include areas of between 15 to 40 acres and will require a master-plan concept to be presented to ensure the development meets the intent of the zone. The intended user radius is from one to one and one-half mile. These centers are ideally located at intersections of arterial or major collector streets. Development in this area includes buildings of up to three stories in height that line the street right-of-way. Multi-family dwellings included in this area may include minimal setbacks. On-site parking is primarily located to the rear of buildings in the center of the block. Landscaping requirements vary, depending on the type of use. It is included for screening parking areas, where visible from the street, and to provide a buffer adjacent less intense uses.

(b)    The TC zoning district is intended to help protect and enhance the historic center of Springville City, generally located between Center Street and 400 South and extending to the east and west for approximately one block. Development in this area includes buildings of up to three stories in height that line the street right-of-way. Parking is provided in the right-of-way and behind the buildings. Landscaping requirements vary, depending on the type of use. It is included for screening parking areas, where visible from the street, and to provide a buffer adjacent less intense uses.

(5)    The Commercial Zoning Districts are intended to provide opportunities for commercial uses based on considerations such as: intensity of use; types of goods and services; and market area. These uses should generally abut on an arterial or major collector street, and in some districts, frontage roads.

(a)    The NC zoning district is intended to provide commercial goods and services to an area of limited size for basic trade and personal services that occur on a daily or frequent basis. The major market area is generally limited to an area of approximately one to one and one-half miles in radius. 

(b)    The CC zoning district is intended to provide a range of commercial goods and services greater than those found in the NC zone but on a more limited basis and intensity that those found in the regional and highway commercial districts. The basic market for this district is vehicle-oriented and the primary market area is Springville City. This type of district should be located on an arterial street, at or near a major intersection. Parking is to be provided on-site. Landscaping is included in all areas not required for building(s), storage, parking and traffic circulation, with parking and storage areas being screened and an appropriate landscaped buffer and fencing adjacent less intense uses.

(c)    The RC zoning district is intended to provide an area in which a full range of commercial and service uses may locate in a limited area. The limited area of this district functions to heighten the intensity of uses, concentrate activities and make it a major commercial destination. These districts should abut arterial streets and be located near free way access, as well as mass transit lines. Parking is to be provided on the site. Landscaping is required in all areas not necessary for building(s), storage, parking and traffic circulation, with parking and storage areas being screened and an appropriate landscaped buffer and fencing adjacent less intense uses.

(d)    The HC zoning district is intended to provide an area abutting major arterial streets or interstate frontage roads for a full range of commercial and professional uses; however, the primary focus should be on uses which require large retail display or merchandise storage area and serve a regional market. Parking is to be provided on the site. Landscaping is required in all areas not necessary for building(s), storage, parking and traffic circulation, with parking and storage areas being screened and an appropriate landscaped buffer and fencing adjacent less intense uses.

(6)    The Industrial Manufacturing Zoning Districts are intended to provide locations for industrial and manufacturing uses in areas where they will have the necessary services and facilities and be located in such a manner as to minimize obtrusions of adjoining uses and districts. These districts should be located near rail lines and have direct access to Interstate Highway interchanges for ease of transportation of goods. In order to minimize conflict with incompatible uses, most non-industrial uses are not allowed in the Industrial Manufacturing zones, excepting those catering primarily to the needs of employees working in the area.

(a)    The LIM zoning district is intended to provide locations for manufacturing and industrial development of less intensive uses. The largest portion of these types of uses shall be contained inside of structures. These districts should be located near major arterial streets and be located so as to provide easy access to the Interstate Highway system. Because of the highly visible location of these uses, special attention shall be paid to visual aesthetics.

(b)    The HIM zoning district is intended to provide locations for heavy industrial and manufacturing development. These uses may or may not be located immediately adjacent major streets, so long as easy access to the Interstate Highway system is provided through areas of similar land uses. Proximity to rail lines may be a determinant in locating these zoning districts.

11-4-408 Multi-Family Residential Design Standards (Non-Overlay Zone Projects Only).

(1)    Dwelling – Multiple-family in the RMF-1 and RMF-2 zones, except those in an overlay zone, shall comply with the following standards:

(a)    Facade Variation – For new development, no two (2) multi-family buildings may possess the same street-facing elevation on a block face. No two (2) facades may be the same as an adjacent or opposite building facade. This standard is met when the street-facing elevations differ from another front facade by at least four (4) of the following criteria, and shall not eliminate any other requirements of the code or this Chapter:

(i)    Articulation;

(ii)    Differing mix of building materials;

(iii)    Variation in roof elevation;

(iv)    Entry/porch (variation in placement and configuration of porches, stoops, covering);

(v)    Fenestration (variation in the arrangement and detailing of windows and other openings);

(vi)    Architectural style (variation in style; e.g., craftsman, prairie, four square, colonial, Tudor, ranch, etc.);

(vii)    Variation of building height and stories; or

(viii)    Color variation.

(b)    Articulation.

(i)    In multi-family buildings individual units shall be emphasized using a variety of techniques that include plane changes, bays, variation in entrances, balconies, dormers, colors, columns, or other details defining the individual unit.

(ii)    All building elevations must be articulated along the vertical face for a minimum depth of one foot (1'), for a length of at least six feet (6'), for every dwelling unit or every thirty feet (30') of horizontal wall plane, whichever is less. This may be accomplished through the use of recesses or extensions of floor area, decks, patios, or entrances.

(iii)    In addition to the standard in subsection (1)(b)(ii) of this section, the vertical mass of buildings shall be broken up through the use of architectural features such as horizontal cornices, pediments, belt-courses, canopies (e.g., covered porches) and/or “bellybands” at least twelve inches (12") in height across the length of the elevation.

Article 3 – HILLSIDE OVERLAY REGULATIONS


11-5-301 Hillside Overlay Regulations.

The Hillside Overlay Zone covers the mountainous and other areas in the City of environmental concern. Because of topography, slope, soil conditions and other natural features, the area is considered to be environmentally fragile, and all developed activity occurring in the area should be carried out in a manner consistent with these natural limitations. It is hereby declared that the purpose and intent in establishing the Hillside Overlay Zone is to:

(1)    Protect and conserve the soils, natural vegetation, and drainage ways and other natural resources within the area.

(2)    Avoid the establishment of hazard from flood, fire, mud slide, and other dangers.

(3)    Preserve the aesthetic appearance of the landscape and prevent excessive degradation of the environment.

(4)    Permit certain types of development to take place under such conditions as will result in the substantial preservation of the natural features within the zone.

(5)    Secure economy in governmental expenditures.


11-5-302 Permitted Uses.

Permitted uses within the Hillside Overlay Zone shall include all uses permitted within the underlying zone subject to compliance with all requirements for development in hillside areas as set forth in this Article or elsewhere in this Code or in specifications and regulations adopted pursuant hereto.


11-5-303 Lot Area Requirements.

The minimum lot area in the Hillside Overlay Zone is twenty thousand (20,000) square feet regardless of the underlying zone requirement.


11-5-304 Lot and Building Configurations.

Width and location requirements of a zoning lot in the Hillside Overlay Zone shall be that of the underlying zone.


11-5-305 Special Provisions.

All uses of land in the Hillside Overlay Zone shall conform to the following criteria:

(1)    All land surface having a slope of twenty-five percent (25%) or greater shall remain in its natural state and shall not be graded or otherwise disturbed, except that the natural vegetation may be supplemented by other plants naturally occurring in the area; provided, however, roads may be constructed on slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) if the following requirements are met:

(a)    The road has been approved and is either an existing City street or detailed plans showing the precise location and engineering detail have been submitted and approved by the City Council after recommendation of the Planning Commission.

(b)    The Planning Commission and City Council have determined that the proposed alignment is necessary for the proper development of the area and that there is no feasible alternate alignment which complies with the slope requirement.

(c)    The plan provides adequate measures to insure that all cut and fill slopes will be stabilized, that erosion hazards will be eliminated, that surface vegetation will be restored, and that other environmental hazards will be adequately handled.

(2)    Each dwelling site shall contain a buildable area of not less than four thousand (4,000) square feet.

(3)    No cut or fill slope that shall be created as a part of the construction of any roadway, dwelling, or other structure shall exceed the critical angle of repose, except by special permission of the City Council after recommendation of the Planning Commission. Such special permission shall not be given until the developer shows that he has adopted all practical measures to reduce the slopes to less than the critical angle of repose by selecting an alternate location, or by planting the slopes with natural vegetation, or by undertaking other action which will have the effect of preventing the soil from moving under the force of gravity until vegetation becomes established.

(4)    All development shall provide to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission for the disposal of surface water originating as a result of any modification in the environment. Provision shall also be made to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission for the accommodation of all storm water run-off arising on or above the site so as to prevent flooding or erosion.

Article 4 – WESTFIELDS AND LAKESIDE OVERLAY REGULATIONS


11-5-401 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose of the Westfields and Lakeside Overlay Zones is to carry out the adopted policies of Springville City concerning the Westfields and Lakeside communities. This will help create attractive, diverse neighborhoods including a wide variety of attached and detached quality housing, along with opportunities for shopping and services all within reasonable walking distance for the majority of area residents. 

(1)    This purpose can be achieved by:

(a)    Providing a network of connected streets and paths that will provide adequate circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles and encourage a less auto-dependent community; 

(b)    Providing a broad range of housing including suburban residences to urban-type apartments and townhouses throughout the area; 

(c)    Providing significant open space, consisting of formal parks located throughout the residential area and squares located in the village center, along with a network of trails adjacent to waterways and the power corridor; and 

(d)    Developing streets that balance the needs of vehicles, pedestrians and residents.

(2)    Examples of architectural features and building siting specifically identified as being desirable are found in some sections of Springville’s Plat A neighborhoods, which may serve as a source of concepts and ideas to emulate. Neighborhoods should be created that are long-term assets to future generations of Springville. Considerations for creating quality, functional neighborhoods include, but are not limited to:

(a)    Similar residential densities generally facing each other across the street and the rear of the lots acting as the boundaries between different densities of housing and types of uses. 

(b)    Higher density developments mixed with single-family detached housing should generally be located near park space or on the edges of the neighborhood. 

(c)    Larger two (2) story houses or twin homes should generally be located on corner lots.

(d)    Front facades should run parallel to the street.

(e)    Well-defined front entries and attractive porches.

(f)    Recessed or detached garages, located behind the front setback line.

(g)    Recessed or detached garages that are not major focal points of houses when viewed from the street and are located behind the front setback line.

(h)    Use of traditional building materials, specifically brick.

(i)    Use of same material on all facades of the building.

(j)    Use of heavier materials (e.g., brick and stone) on the bottom of the facade, with lighter materials on the top (e.g., stucco or siding).

(k)    Use of heavier materials on the primary facades with lighter materials on projections or relief features.

(l)    Darker colors on the bottom of the facade with lighter colors on the top.

(m)    Vertical orientation of primary windows.

(n)    Symmetrical placement of window within the bay of the facade.

(o)    Use of mullions and muntins to break up large expanses of glass, creates a vertical emphasis of windows.

(p)    Window treatments should either be recessed, trimmed or project from the exterior wall to provide variation in the facade. Window sills and window heads are also encouraged.

(q)    Tree lined streets with adequately sized park strips.

(r)    Roof pitches appropriate to the style, typically greater than five to twelve (5:12).

(Ord. No. 16-2016 § 1, 07/05/2016)


11-5-402 Use and Development Regulations. Revised 9/19

Uses in the Westfields and Lakeside Overlays are limited to the permitted, conditional and accessory uses in the underlying zone for those developments not participating in the density bonus program. For developments participating in the density bonus program, attached dwelling units will be allowed in accordance with the requirements of the density bonus program.

Each portion of the development must correspond to an existing zoning designation adopted by Springville City, for the purpose of meeting the residential site development standards, and that designation must be indicated on the plat or site plan submission. The indicated designations do not change the underlying zone. The R1-5 zone designation is only allowed in the Lakeside Overlay and shall not be allowed in the Westfields Overlay.

(Ord. No. 16-2016 § 1, 07/05/2016; Ord. No. 03-2017 § 3, 03/21/2017; Ord. No. 15-2019 § 3, 07/02/2019)


11-5-403 Density Determination.

The following are the baseline numbers establishing densities for each residential zone:

	R-1-10	3.0

	R-1-8	3.8

	R-2	6.0

	RMF-1	7.7

	RMF-2	11.5

The table above is based on the gross developable acreage of the entire proposed development. The baseline units per acre number in the above table shall serve as the maximum number of units allowed in any development not participating in the density bonus program and shall serve as the baseline number from which densities will be calculated for developments that are in the density bonus program.

The area of nonresidential uses in a proposed development, except for parks and open spaces, will be excluded from the gross developable acreage when determining the baseline numbers as per the table above.

11-5-407 Density Bonus.

(1)    For developers requesting densities greater than the baseline density, the development must comply with two (2) or more of the bonus density requirements described in this Section, depending on the desired density increase. Participation in the density bonus program is contingent upon meeting at least one (1) of the requirements of the “Parks, Open Space and Other Public Lands” and “Building Materials” categories. A minimum of three percent (3%) shall be achieved from each category. For developments in the Village Center a participation minimum of twelve percent (12%) in the “Open Space and Other Public Lands” and fifteen percent (15%) in the “Building Materials” categories is required. The Planning Commission and City Council shall review the project at the preliminary stage and determine if the proposed design complies with the intent of the bonus density requirements before points will be granted.

(2)    In order to achieve the maximum density bonus allowed in the zone, the development shall have received density bonus points from at least one (1) component in at least three (3) of the following categories: (a) Parks, Open Space and Other Public Lands; (b) Building Materials; (c) Design Features; (d) Building Mix; and (e) Recreational Vehicle Storage. 

(3)    The bonus density requirements are as follows:

(a)    Parks, Open Space and Other Public Lands. A primary objective of the Westfields and Lakeside Overlays is meeting the objectives of Springville City to preserve some specific locations of open space and establish certain types of parks and open space. Additionally, there are public uses that will need to be located in the area that are important to the area functioning appropriately. Springville City will have the right to accept or reject any areas proposed to meet this requirement.

 

	PARKS, OPEN SPACE AND OTHER PUBLIC LANDS

	Density Bonus Improvement	Requirements and Bonus

	Park land and improvements donated to Springville City	A 1.2% density bonus for each 1% of developed park land within the development up to a 12% density bonus. The park will become the property of Springville City.

Parks shall include a minimum of 100% of the total park boundary along a public street and be centrally located within the development. Parks adjacent linear open space and/or public or quasi-public grounds or uses may be accepted with less than 100% of the park boundary adjacent a public street on a case-by-case basis and may require off-street parking.

Springville City will not accept parks of less than 5 acres. Parks shall include improvements totaling no less than the amount per acre established by resolution and approved by the City Council and shall include grading, sprinkler system and installation of the lawn, trees and other planting. Other improvements may include restrooms, tennis and basketball courts, soccer fields, baseball diamonds, playgrounds, trails, benches, picnic shelters and other types of improvements. The developer will be responsible for verifying improvement expenditures. 

	Linear open space and trails along waterways and the power line corridor	A 0.7% density bonus for each 1% of land developed for a linear trail system within the development up to 7% density bonus. The trail system shall become property of Springville City.

Improvements shall include: grading improvements, 10-foot-wide hard-surfaced trail, benches every 1/8 mile and landscaping, including at least 3 trees per 100 linear feet. Other types of improvements may include trail heads. Parks shall include improvements totaling no less than the amount per acre established by resolution and approved by the City Council. 

	Fees in lieu of park land and improvements	For parcels that are too small for development of a park meeting the minimum City standard of 5 acres, a fee in lieu may be paid at the rate of the value of the land per acre plus improvements totaling no less than the amount per acre established by resolution and approved by the City Council and be prorated at 1.2% density bonus for the equivalent value of 1% land and development costs up to a maximum of 12% density bonus. 

	Public property dedications	A density bonus of 0.5% for each 1% of land identified by the City for a public purpose and deeded to the City.

(b)    Building Materials. Historically, brick was the primary exterior finish for buildings in Springville and the intermountain west, because of the abundance of clay and the limited quantities of wood. Stone was also used on a more limited basis for exterior finishes. The maintenance-free nature of these materials and the variety of types of ways they can be used to create interest and variety make them a desired component for housing in the Westfields and Lakeside Overlays. 



	BUILDING MATERIALS

	Density Bonus Improvement	Requirements and Bonus

	
[IMAGE]

See Figure 108(1).


[IMAGE]


    Figure 108(1)	Figure 108(2)

(2)    Clear vision for intersecting streets and railroad. In all zones which require a front yard and in all lots which lie adjacent to railroad tracks, an unobstructed vision clearance between the elevations of two feet (2') to seven feet (7') above the grade of the sidewalk within a “clear vision triangle”; formed by a diagonal line connecting lines located at the top back of the curb extending from the intersection thirty feet (30') on local and collector streets and fifty feet (50') on arterial streets. Where one (1) of the streets is a different classification, the more stringent requirement will apply. Where no curb exists the clear view area shall include that portion of the yard area lying within a triangular area formed by a diagonal line connecting lines located at the property line twenty (20') from the intersection of said property line. See Figure 108(2).

(3)    Corner lots with rear yards adjoining an interior lot. A second clear vision area is required where the rear of a corner lot adjoins an interior lot.

(d)    Non-view-obstructing fences not exceeding six feet (6') in height.


11-6-109 Effect of Street Plan.

Wherever a front or side setback is required for a building, which building abuts on a proposed street which has not been constructed but which has been designated by the Planning Commission as a future street, the depth of such front or side yard shall be measured from the planned street lines.


11-6-110 Location of Barns.

No barn, corral or coop shall be constructed closer than fifty feet (50') to any existing dwelling nor shall any corral, pen or coop be constructed closer than twenty feet (20') to any open waterway that drains into a natural stream.

11-6-112 Fractional Numbers.

Any computation or measurement resulting in a fractional number shall be rounded down to the next smaller whole number, unless specifically expressed otherwise.


11-6-113 Off-Street Parking.

(1)    The purpose for off-street parking requirements is to provide adequate parking for the intended use of a parcel while eliminating the need to park in the public right-of-way. Every building, structure, improvement, and use shall provide permanent, maintained off-street parking as specified in this Chapter. The parking shall be a continuing obligation of the property owner as long as the use continues. It shall be unlawful for a land owner to eliminate required off-street parking unless otherwise provided on the parcel and approved by the City.

(a)    Parking for Non-Conforming Uses: Any use of property which, on the effective date of this Chapter or of any subsequent amendment, is non-conforming only with the regulations relating to off-street parking facilities may continue in the same manner; provided, that parking facilities shall not be further reduced.

(b)    Parking for Mobile Home Parks: This section shall not apply to the R-MHP Zone. Regulations for off-street parking in that zone are contained in the development and design standards for mobile home parks.

(2)    General Provisions. The following general provisions apply to all off-street parking requirements of this Chapter.

(a)    Location. The location of off-street parking facilities shall be as follows, and shall not be located within the public right-of-way:

(i)    For single-family, duplex, and multi-family residential dwellings, required parking shall be located on the same lot as the building which they are required to serve. Required off-street parking shall not be located in a required front yard or side yard that abuts a street setback.

(ii)    Parking for multiple-family buildings shall be located either behind the building or twenty feet (20') behind the front setback of a building within an interior side yard. The Commission may approve front loaded garages in multi-family buildings when the designated parking is at least twenty feet (20') behind the front facade and the width of the garage facade facing the street is less than thirty-four percent (34%) of the total building facade facing the street. Common underground parking garages with internal circulation may also be considered.

(iii)    Parking in the VC-Village Center and TC-Town Center Districts shall be located behind the building.

(iv)    For all other uses, including commercial and industrial uses, required parking shall be located on the same lot or on an abutting lot. In no case shall required parking be located across a public street without written approval of the Planning Commission and only when the parking area is within two hundred feet (200').

(v)    If parking is located on a lot or parcel under different ownership, a perpetual easement must be recorded in the office of the Utah County Recorder prior to final approval.

(vi)    Tandem parking (one (1) space in front of another) will not be allowed to satisfy the requirements found herein, except as defined in the Design Standards for New Construction in the Springville Historic District.

(b)    Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be appropriate to the task. Any lights provided or required to illuminate a parking area shall be arranged in a manner that will reflect light away from adjacent properties.

(c)    Shared Parking. The Planning Commission may approve the joint use of a parking lot or facility; provided, that the applicant can show that conflict between the different users can be effectively eliminated. For instance, willing parties such as a church and a commercial business may share parking facilities if typical heavy use parking times allow. Copy of recorded perpetual easement shall be provided to the Community Development Director.

(d)    Construction plans for any parking facility or the alteration of any parking facility shall be submitted to the City for review and shall be approved by the Planning Commission. A parking lot or structure may be approved as part of the project approval.

(e)    Change of Use. Whenever the use of any building is changed, the new use shall not be permitted and a business license shall not be issued until and unless the premises comply with the requirements contained herein.

(3)    Design and Construction Standards. All parking facilities shall satisfy the following minimum standards for design of parking stalls and construction standards:

(a)    All parking facilities shall be hard surfaced with asphalt or concrete or similar impervious materials. The materials shall meet the approved standards and specifications and be capable of handling the anticipated size and weight of vehicles, including public safety vehicles.

(b)    Each parking lot shall be surrounded by a concrete curb or other border approved by the City Engineer to ensure the life of the surface and to limit the access to approved ingress and egress.

(c)    All parking spaces shall have minimum dimensions of nine feet (9') by twenty feet (20') for parking at right angles and shall require twenty-four feet (24') backing distance in aisle width. Parallel parking spaces shall have a minimum length of twenty-two feet (22').

(d)    Requirements for parking developed at varying angles are according to Table 1 below and included in this Section. Parking stalls designed at less than a ninety (90) degree angle shall be allowed for one (1) way traffic only.

(e)    Parking shall be designed to avoid backing onto a public street, except on minor local streets where the size or shape of the parcel is such that development would be precluded otherwise.

(f)    Parking for the handicapped shall be provided at a size, number, location, and with signage as specified by State and federal regulations.

(g)    Parking in R-1 zones shall have two (2) covered spaces except those lots of less than sixty feet (60') in width located in the Springville historic district which shall have at least one (1) covered space. Single-family dwellings in all other zones shall have at least one (1) covered parking space. For all two (2) unit and multiple-family dwellings there shall be one (1) covered stall per dwelling unit.

(h)    In addition to any other landscaping requirements listed in Sections 11-6-208 through 11-6-210, parking lots with two hundred (200) spaces or more shall include a landscaped area, which includes a walkway connecting the street right-of-way to the store entrance of at least ten feet (10') in width.

(i)    Separation from Buildings. Excluding single-family and two (2) family dwellings, all off-street parking spaces and interior access drives shall maintain a minimum five foot (5') separation from the wall of a building.

(j)    Underground Parking Structures. All parking spaces within a common underground parking structure with internal circulation shall have minimum dimensions of nine feet (9') by eighteen feet (18') for parking at right angles with a minimum two feet (2') of spacing between the parking stop and the wall.

    The letters in the Figures 1 and 2 correspond to the dimensions in Table 1 above.

(4)    Maintenance. All parking facilities shall be maintained and kept free of garbage and debris. Striping of parking stalls shall be kept in a manner that allows each stall to be identified. Potholes, cracks, and other damage to the surface shall be repaired in a timely manner.

Any violation of this Section shall be determined to be a Zoning Violation and shall be punishable by a Class B misdemeanor pursuant to Section 12-2-21 of Springville City Code.

(5)    Reduction in Parking Standards.

(a)    An applicant may apply to the Planning Commission for a reduction in the amount of parking spaces. The applicant must clearly demonstrate that the required number of parking stalls is unnecessary for the proposed use and any possible future use of the building. Any request which lowers the amount of parking stalls by more than twenty percent (20%) shall not be approved. 

(b)    For the Historic Downtown Area (which is defined as that area zoned as TC Town Center and generally located between Center Street and 400 South from 100 East to 100 West) the Planning Commission may grant a parking reduction based upon the following considerations:

(i)    A reduction in parking will still adequately meet the unique needs of the proposed land use;

(ii)    A reduction in parking will not cause a shortage for other uses located in the area; and

(iii)    A reduction in parking will contribute to the vitality and overall well being of the Historic Downtown Area.

(6)    Parking Spaces Required. Off-street parking shall be provided as follows for all new buildings and structures, or enlargement of any existing buildings or structures. Should the required parking stalls as calculated using the following standards end in a fraction, the standard shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

(a)    Requirements for types of buildings and uses not specifically listed herein shall be determined by the Planning Commission, based upon the requirements for the most comparable uses specified herein. Buildings with more than one (1) use shall provide parking required for each use.

(1)    No building permit shall be issued for the construction of a dwelling or commercial or industrial structure which is to be located on a lot or parcel outside of an approved subdivision, unless said lot or parcel shall be fully improved. Said full improvements shall consist of municipal water, secondary water, and sewer to the property, paved street, curb, gutter and sidewalk. If the lot or parcel abuts on either side with a lot or parcel for which curb, gutter, or sidewalk has not been installed, an applicant for a building permit may, in lieu of installing the improvements required by this paragraph prior to obtaining a building permit, include such improvements in his construction plans and sign an agreement with the City that such improvements will be installed, or if by recommendation of the City Engineer, a waiver of protest may be signed and approved by the City Council, waiving the right of the landowner to protest any possible future special improvement district.

(2)    If an applicant for a building permit is required to install any improvements pursuant to the preceding paragraph, or if the Building Inspector determines that the construction contemplated by the application may result in any damage to a public street, curb and gutter, sidewalk, water, or sewer, or electric line, or any other publicly owned improvement, or if the construction contemplated by the application will include connection or relocation of any municipal water or sewer line or excavation within any public street, the Building Inspector shall require, prior to issuance of the building permit, that the applicant post with the City a guarantee of performance. Such performance guarantee will guarantee that all improvements required by the preceding paragraph will be installed to City standards and specifications, that any damage done during the construction to a sidewalk, curb, gutter, street, sewer line, water line, electric line or other public improvement will be repaired to City standards and specifications, and that all connections to and relocations of the municipal water and sewer system will be properly made. All such performance guarantees shall be in an amount determined adequate by the Building Inspector to protect the interests of the City, but in no event shall an applicant be required to post a guarantee in an amount greater than $15.00 per frontage foot of the lot or parcel to which the permit will apply. All guarantees shall be in the form required by Chapter 5 of Title 14 of City Code.


11-6-121 Flag Lot Development.

Purpose: Flag lots are intended to allow development of substantial, buildable properties where the extension of public streets cannot or should not be extended, due to sensitive land, topographic or other natural features.

Additionally, constraints created by the existing built environment may be a consideration. Lot size for such uses is necessarily large to help insure privacy of adjacent properties that are most impacted by the development of the flag lot(s).

(1)    The Community Development Director may approve the creation of a flag lot and/or the construction of a one (1) family dwelling on a flag lot. Approval shall be subject to the following:

(a)    The site is not developable under conventional development standards and procedures;

(b)    No area, setback, or other variance will be required to allow the proposal;

(c)    The proposal is compatible with the existing development, in terms of height, building materials and animal keeping and approval of the dwelling will not adversely affect the living environment of the surrounding area;

(d)    No deleterious objects or structures shall be constructed or maintained on the premises; and

(e)    Public safety issues, such as fire hydrants, have been adequately addressed.

(2)    Submission Requirements. A detailed site plan shall be submitted for review by the Community Development Director. Said site plan shall include:

(a)    All existing and proposed structures on the building site and adjacent parcels, driveway and parking areas and the area on the site to be landscaped;

(b)    Proposed access to the building site along an access way which shall not be less than twenty-four feet (24') in width nor more than one hundred twenty feet (120') in length or as required by Section 503 of the International Fire Code. Two (2) adjoining flag lots may share one (1) access way when designated as a right-of-way easement for the perpetual use of the adjoining flag lots and as a public utility easement. At least twenty feet (20') for the full length of the access way shall be paved with either concrete or asphalt. No parking will be allowed on any portion of the access way. The portion of the access way that is unpaved shall be landscaped;

(c)    The proposed area of a building site, which shall not be less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet;

(d)    The setbacks from property line to the proposed structure, which shall meet the requirements of the underlying zone, except for side yards that abut existing rear yards, which shall be set back at least twenty feet (20');

(e)    The orientation of the proposed house. A house located on a flag lot may orient the front of the house (i) parallel to the public right-of-way from which the access lane extends, or (ii) facing the side of the property on which the access lane is located. Orientation of a house does not affect where setbacks are measured on the lot. For example, the front setback is always measured from the lot line of the flag lot closest to and parallel to the public right-of-way from which the flag lot is accessed.

(f)    The proposed width of the building site, which shall meet the minimum width of the underlying zone and extend at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the depth of the lot;

(g)    All setbacks. Where a property contains an access easement, setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the easement closest to the main structure, or where the main structure is proposed.

11-6-212 Landscape Transition Buffer and Fence Modifications and Waivers.

(1)    Where the provisions of this Chapter would reduce the usable area of a lot due to lot configuration or size to a point that would preclude a reasonable use of the lot, the landscape buffer and fencing may be modified by the Planning Commission where the intent of this Chapter has been met through the combination of structural and landscape design techniques.

(2)    The landscape buffer may be modified where the building, fencing and/or land between the building and the property line has been specifically designed to minimize adverse impact through a combination of structural and landscape design techniques.

(3)    The landscape buffer and fencing requirement may be waived or modified where the adjacent land is designated on the zoning map or in the adopted general plan for a use similar to that of the parcel under site plan consideration. In situations where a petitioner is requesting that required fencing be waived or modified on residential developments adjacent to agricultural uses and/or zoning districts, the petitioner shall submit a request including their reason for waiver or modification, along with their proposed approach to meeting the intent of the ordinance. The following criteria apply:

(a)    The adjacent agricultural property must have all the infrastructure (roads, sanitary and storm sewer, water, etc.) necessary for development; or

(b)    The topography or vegetation of the adjacent property would make a fence ineffective or cause a hardship if the developer is required to fence the property;

(c)    The petitioner must request in writing to be placed on the Planning Commission agenda; and

(d)    The petitioner must have a proposal of the type of fencing and be prepared to present this to the Planning Commission.

(4)    The landscape buffer and fencing requirements may be modified where the adjoining property is used for any public purpose other than a school or hospital.

(5)    The landscape buffer and fencing requirement may be modified where adjacent residential property is used for any conditional uses except nursery schools, day care centers and schools of general or special education.

(6)    The landscape buffer and fencing requirements may be modified when a residential subdivision borders a railroad or transit right-of-way, freeway, or arterial street. The subdivision design shall include adequate provisions for noise reduction, safety and visual screening. The modification of the landscape buffer may, in some cases, provide for a larger buffer area and additional plantings depending on the types and location of the use which is being buffered. Parallel streets, fences, landscaped buffer areas, berms and sound walls or the combination of buffer techniques may be required.

(7)    The fencing requirement may be waived or modified where the topography of the lot providing the fencing and the lot being protected is such that the fence would not be effective.

(8)    The landscape buffer and fencing requirement may be modified for any public use when such has specifically been designed to minimize adverse impact on adjacent properties.

TABLE 2 – LANDSCAPING AND FENCING REQUIREMENTS 

The charts below indicate the minimum requirements for landscape strip widths, tree heights, fencing materials and fence heights. Table 2 gives the codes for landscaping and fencing requirements, based on the proposed new land use and the existing, neighboring land uses. Tables 3 and 4 explain the requirement codes. 

To determine the minimum landscape and fencing requirements, find the row in Table 2 that includes the proposed new land use and the column that matches the existing, neighboring land use. The codes found in the cell where the row and column meet give the minimum transition buffers required. Where multiple fencing options are given, either shall be permissible. 

For example, if a new professional office (row 6) were to be built next to existing single-family homes (column 1), transition requirements L-i and F-d or F-e would apply. In other words, a fifteen foot (15') wide landscape strip with thirty foot (30') tall trees and a six foot (6') fence made out of either brick masonry or some other architecturally solid material, such as wood or vinyl, would have to be installed to screen these differing land uses.

Article 3 – SIGN REGULATIONS


11-6-301 Purpose.

(1)    The purpose of this Section is to encourage signs that create and maintain safe and aesthetically pleasing building elevations and streetscapes while allowing for adequate identification, communication and advertising for land uses in the City.

(2)    In adopting these regulations, the City Council recognizes and seeks to preserve and enhance Springville City’s rich heritage and reputation as Utah’s “Art City,” its natural endowment of views and vistas associated with its unique placement along the Wasatch Mountain Range, and its rich mix of land uses. Furthermore, the City Council aims to protect and enhance economic viability by assuring that Springville will be a visually pleasant place to visit or live. In addition, the City Council seeks to promote signage that ensures the safety of residents and visitors.

(3)    Therefore, the City Council finds and declares that the regulations set forth in this Article will achieve the following:

(a)    Signs that are compatible with their surroundings and effectively index the environment while preserving and promoting the aesthetics, and sense of order in the community.

(b)    Signs that are conducive to promoting traffic safety and add to the convenience and enjoyment of public travel by preventing visual distraction for motorists and protection of pedestrians.

(c)    Signs that preserve and enhance property values, increase the standard of living within the community, and serve to attract visitors to the city by establishing first-class business and commercial districts.

(d)    Signs that adhere to adopted fire, traffic and safety standards in order to ensure the health, safety and general welfare of residents and visitors.

(Ord. No. 07-2010, 06/01/2010)


11-6-302 Scope.

The intent of this Article is to regulate the design, location, construction, erection, alteration, use and maintenance of any sign in Springville City that is visible to the public from a public right-of-way. It is the intent of this Article to be neutral in terms of all legal sign content.

The regulations of this Article are intended to apply to both on-premises and off-premises signs, but do not apply to hand-held placards and other similar devices traditionally used for public protest and the exercise of free speech. Where any commercial message is permitted, a noncommercial message may be substituted in its place.

(Ord. No. 07-2010, 06/01/2010)


11-6-303 General Design Guidelines.

The placement and location of signs should be compatible with the development projects in which they are located, as well as the surrounding district. Signs should be an integral design element of the building and should be compatible with the style of building in terms of location, scale, color and lettering. Signs should be located for the convenience of motorists, and where appropriate, pedestrians. When siting signs near residential areas, consideration of the effects of lighting and sign visibility should be considered in order to help protect the residential character of the area.

The presentation of information on signs should be concise, clear and intelligible.

Lettering and graphics should be of sufficient size to be legible and understandable for the environment in which it is seen. In order to accomplish this, the minimum standards are required for the business name.

11-6-312 Sign Districts.

(1)    Intent and Purpose – Throughout Springville City, there are a variety of commercial and industrial areas that are all important to the vitality of the City. They vary from older, traditional commercial areas with a mix of pedestrian traffic to automobile-oriented, regional commercial centers adjacent the interstate system. Within residential areas, needs for signs are also important, but should not take away from the residential nature of the area. For purposes of this Article, the sign districts will be used to regulate signs. These districts are identified on the sign district map. As rezoning of properties occurs, the sign district map shall be amended, if needed, to reflect the new zoning designation.

(a)    Sign District A (Historic Downtown Core/Village Center Districts) includes those areas located in the Town Center located between 400 North and 300 South and the Westfields Village Center. As Springville’s original “downtown,” building facades were generally constructed on the front property line and the area has a strong pedestrian orientation that the City wishes to enhance. This area includes buildings of architectural and historic importance to the community. Speed limits through this area are affected by semaphores placement at Center, 200 and 400 North and South Streets. The Village Center is planned to incorporate the same site and building design features as those found in Springville’s historic downtown and will serve as the location of the intermodal transit hub.

Because of the architectural and historic nature and building-types located in these areas, wall signs and projecting signs are most in keeping with the nature of the area. Where freestanding signage is allowed, it shall be low-profile signage.

(b)    Sign District B (The Main Street Corridor) includes those commercially zoned properties located to the north and south of the Historic Downtown Core of the City. Those areas of Main Street located on either side of the Historic Downtown are included in Sign District B. These areas are primarily auto-oriented in nature and include a wide mix of uses and lot widths and sizes, which are important considerations in determining what types of freestanding signage are appropriate for these areas. While speed limits through this area vary, with those nearest the Historic Downtown Core being lower than those located north of 900 North Street, as commercial uses intensify within this area, traffic speeds will move more slowly along all of Springville’s Main Street.

Freestanding signage requirements are based on posted and actual speeds through this area now and in the future, opportunities for business to be identified and the residential areas located behind commercial area. Wall signs are encouraged, with orientation to Main Street and away from residential areas. Freestanding signage is allowed, based on street frontage, function and proximity to residential development.

(c)    Sign District C (East 400 South/Museum Corridor) includes those commercially zoned areas located east of 100 East Street. This area includes a mix of smaller-scale professional offices and commercial retail uses surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The area includes a mix of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Signage in this area is low-profile and the intent of this Article is to retain this signage characteristic for this area. Wall signage is also allowed in this corridor area.

(d)    Sign District D (Gateway Corridors) includes portions of 400 South and 1600 South. These commercial corridors are located in the Westfields Community. Signage in this area will allow for low-profile, pylon and wall signs.

(e)    Sign District E (Commercial properties as shown on the sign district map that are near the UDOT I-15 corridor and west of the 1500 West railroad tracks.) – Within this corridor, low-profile and pole signs are allowed. Wall signs are also permitted in this area.

(f)    Sign District F (Industrial Districts) includes all properties zoned for light or heavy industrial manufacturing. These uses typically do not include retail traffic and the buildings associated with the use typically include adequate space for signage, along with low-profile signs.

(g)    Sign District G (Residential and Agricultural) includes properties zoned for the full range of residential, along with agricultural uses. Because the nature of these areas is primarily residential in nature, total signage area is necessarily limited.

11-6-314 Nonconforming Signs.

(1)    Purpose and Intent – In order to minimize confusion and unfair competitive disadvantage to those businesses which are required to satisfy current standards of this Chapter, the City intends to apply firm regulation of existing nonconforming signs with a view to their eventual elimination. This goal shall be achieved by strictly construing limits on change, expansion, alteration, abandonment and restoration of nonconforming signs.

(2)    Alterations – Excluding normal maintenance and minor repair, a nonconforming sign shall not be reconstructed, raised, moved, replaced, extended, altered or enlarged unless the changes are specifically in accordance with sections of State law that supersede this Article.

(3)    Exemptions – The following alterations shall be exempt from the provisions of this subsection:

(a)    Face changes in a nonconforming sign;

(b)    Copy changes in a nonconforming permanent sign which was originally approved to accommodate changeable copy features; and

(c)    Maintaining or lessening height, width or sign area of a nonconforming sign.

(4)    Billboards – The provisions of this Section shall not apply to billboards; however, existing, nonconforming billboards located in Sign District E may be raised to a maximum height of thirty-five feet (35') and changed to electronic message signs. Billboards in all other sign districts shall not be raised in height nor changed to electronic message signs. If State law allows billboard owners to make changes to their billboards differently than what is allowed in this subsection, State law will be followed. Nonconforming billboards shall be terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 10-9a-512, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended. In the event that such provisions are repealed, nonconforming billboards shall be subject to the provisions of this Article.

(5)    Special Exceptions – Upon application by the sign or business owner, the Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to allow retention or relocation on the property of a nonconforming sign; provided, that the Board determines that:

(a)    The proposed change to the nonconforming sign is determined to be an acceptable and appropriate alternative to the current standards and ordinances;

(b)    The action will not impose a burden on other property in the City beyond that posed by a conforming sign;

(c)    Approval will provide a forum for free expression or other benefits to the public; and



(d)    Signs located on buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places are significant to the character of the building.

Unfair competitive disadvantage of businesses in the City whose signs do comply with this Article is not to be construed as a burden to be considered by the Board of Adjustment. Purely economic factors, such as expense of removing or altering a nonconforming sign or of purchasing a conforming sign shall not be considered as a reason for granting a special exception by the Board. The Board may impose reasonable requirements with which the petitioner must comply as a condition of approval of a special exception.

(Amended by Ord. No. 34-2007, 10/02/2007; Ord. No. 07-2010, 06/01/2010; Ord. No. 01-2015 § 1, 02/03/2015)

Article 4 – WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES


11-6-401 Purpose.

The purposes of this Article are: 

(1)    To regulate personal wireless services antennas, and related electronic equipment and structures. 

(2)    To provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the City. 

(3)    To minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the use of stealth facilities, by encouraging the co-location of multiple antennas on a single structure, by encouraging the location of antennas on pre-existing support structures, and by encouraging the use of City-owned property for antenna support structures. 

(4)    To establish siting, appearance, and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the construction, use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities. 

(5)    To comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 by establishing regulations that (a) do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, (b) do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services, and (c) are not based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Federal Communication Commission’s regulations concerning such emissions.


11-6-402 Findings. 

The Planning Commission and City Council establish the following findings: 

1.    Personal wireless services are of increasing importance and value to the citizens of Springville. The growing industry and evolving technology continue to increase the quality of life for City residents and contribute to the public safety, health and welfare of the City. Accommodating the expansions of networks and transmission facilities is important to creating a well-connected, functioning city.

2.    Excessive proliferation of wireless transmission facilities can have negative impacts on the residents and neighborhoods they serve, particularly aesthetic impacts. Balancing the benefits of transmission facilities with the costs or impacts provides unique zoning challenges for the City.

3.    The City needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the City, against the sometimes differing interests and desires of others concerning health, safety, welfare, aesthetics, and orderly planning of the community. 

4.    The City has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the City, and expects the increased demand to continue into the future. 

5.    The visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their siting, construction, maintenance and use. 

6.    The City owns numerous large parcels of property spread throughout the City that provide opportunities to locate transmission facilities that are contextually less obtrusive than other privately owned sites and provide possible sources of income that can offset other costs to City residents. 

7.    Encouraging personal wireless services facilities to be located on City property, with lease payments paid to the City instead of an individual property owner, indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the adverse impacts of the facilities, and is therefore one of the fairest methods of distributing burden and benefit. 

8.    Spacing transmission towers evenly throughout the city rather than clustering towers reduces the disproportionate negative impacts otherwise borne by adjacent properties. 

9.    Because of the height and appearance of some personal wireless services facilities, surrounding properties bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower. A private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who receives compensation for the facility, while neighboring property owners generally take the brunt of negative impacts associated with the facilities. 

10.    Consideration of locating facilities on buildings, structures, existing towers or as stealth facilities reduces the negative impacts of transmission facilities as exposed, standalone facilities. These approaches more often effectively mitigate the negative impacts than the erection of additional towers. The city does, however, acknowledge that there may be situations where a taller structure can reduce the need for a number of smaller facilities and can be less obtrusive than the collective impact of the smaller structures.

11.    Buildings and structures on public property are capable of being used to provide support for antenna arrays, thus reducing the need for additional towers in all areas of the City. 

12.    The public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by encouraging the use of less visually intrusive antennas and permitting the locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication towers and antenna support structures that are co-located. 

13.    The requirements set forth in this ordinance for the placement of personal wireless services facilities are necessary to protect the heath, safety and general welfare of the community.

14.    Springville City recognizes the significance of its nationally registered historic district and other historic resources in the City that are potentially impacted by wireless transmission facilities. Mitigation of the negative impacts in the district and near historical resources is a high priority. Monopoles and other towers should be avoided on public properties within the historic district and should be prohibited on private properties within the historic district. Additionally, applications affecting the district and other resources on or eligible for the National Register are subject to Federal and State regulations including Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

15.    Transmission facilities are subject to State and Federal Laws that include possible requirements for wireless providers to make room on transmission facilities for collocation of other carriers as well as local government authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection of telecommunication towers. This authority allows a city to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area.

If a transmission facility requires a conditional use permit, the review shall be in accordance with the City’s standard conditional use permit approval process. The City shall process all applications within a reasonable time and shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services. Any decision to deny a request to place, construct, or modify wireless facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.


11-6-407 Building Permits Required. 

No wireless facility shall be constructed until the applicant obtains a building permit from the City. No building permit shall be issued for any project for which a site plan, amended site plan or conditional use permit is required, until the site plan, amended site plan or conditional use permit has been approved by the appropriate authority. If the design or engineering of the antenna support structure is beyond the expertise of the Building Official, the City may require third party review by an engineer selected by the City prior to the issuance of a building permit. The applicant shall pay an additional fee to cover the cost of the third party review. 


11-6-408 Location and Type Priority. 

1.    Priority of Antenna Site Locations. Wireless facilities shall be located as unobtrusively as is reasonably possible. To accomplish this goal, the provider shall make a good faith effort to site antennas in the following order of priority: 

a.    Existing Structures or Stealth Facilities. First priority shall be granted to antennas located on existing structures or antennas qualifying as stealth facilities, as follows: 

i.    Existing Structures. Lawfully existing wireless facilities designed for collocation, buildings, structures and antenna support structures, provided that the buildings, structures or support structures are: (1) located on a wireless facility designed an approved for collocation, (2)located in a non-residential zone, or (3) located in a residential zone on property that is being used for non-residential uses (e.g. government, school or church), or (4) located in a residential zone on a property that is being used for a multi-family residential building having eight (8) or more dwelling units; or 

ii.    Stealth Facilities. Antennas certified as stealth facilities as set forth in this ordinance. 

b.    Monopoles on City-owned property. Monopoles constructed on City-owned property. 

c.    Monopoles on property owned by a non-City public agency. Monopoles constructed on property owned by a non-City public agency. 

d.    Monopoles on non-residential private property.

(3) Located outside of the nationally registered historic district.

e.    Other. Any combination of antenna type and location other than those listed above. 

2.    Burden of Proof. If the applicant desires to locate antennas on a site other than the highest priority site, the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating to the approving authority why it could not locate antennas on sites with a higher priority than the site chosen by the applicant. To do so, the applicant shall provide the following information to the approving authority: 

a.    Higher Priority Sites. The identity and location of any higher priority sites located within the desired service area. 

b.    Reason for Rejection of Higher Priority Sites. The reason(s) why the higher priority sites are not technologically, legally or economically feasible. The applicant must make a good faith effort to locate antennas on a higher priority site. The City may request information from outside sources to justify or rebut the applicant’s reasons for rejecting a higher priority site. 

c.    Justification for Proposed Site. Why the proposed site is essential to meet the service demands of the geographic service area and the citywide network. 

3.    If the applicant desires to construct a monopole, the applicant shall also submit a detailed written description of why the applicant cannot obtain coverage using existing buildings or structures or stealth facilities. 


11-6-409 Permitted Uses and Locations. 

1.    Permitted and Conditional Uses. Wireless transmission facilities are defined in Springville Code as Class 3 Utilities. Permissions are listed in the Land use Matrix of Title 11. Certain types of facilities are listed specifically in the matrix and their respective land use classification in the table supersedes the more general classification of a Class 3 Utility. In determining whether or not to approve a conditional use permit the Planning Commission shall consider, as a minimum, the following:

a.    Compatibility. Compatibility of the facility with the height, mass and design of buildings, structures and uses in the vicinity of the facility. 

b.    Screening. Whether the facility uses existing or proposed vegetation, topography or structures in a manner that effectively screens the facility. 

c.    Disguise. Whether the facility is disguised in a manner that mitigates potential negative impacts on surrounding properties. 

d.    Parcel Size. Whether the facility is located on a parcel of sufficient size to adequately support the facility. 

e.    Location on Parcel. Whether the structure is situated on the parcel in a manner that can best protect the interests of surrounding property owners, but still accommodate other appropriate uses of the parcel. 

f.    Location in General. Whether location or co-location of the facility on other structures in the same vicinity is practicable, without significantly affecting the antenna transmission or reception capabilities. 

g.    Co-location. The willingness of the applicant to allow co-location on its facility by other personal wireless services providers on such terms as are common in the industry. 

h.    Historic District. Monopoles are not permitted in the city’s nationally registered historic district. This district includes all properties within the district boundary as well as those properties outside the boundary with street frontage along the boundary. The boundary is:

•    400 North Street between 400 East and 400 West

•    400 East Street between 400 North and 800 South

•    800 South Street between 400 East and Main Street

•    Main Street between 800 South and 400 South

•    400 South Street between Main Street and 400 West

•    400 West Street between 400 South and 400 North 

2.    Not Permitted Uses. The following antenna types and antenna locations are not permitted, except upon a showing of necessity (inability to achieve coverage or capacity in the service area) by the applicant, in which case they shall be considered as conditional uses: 

a.    Lattice Towers and Guyed Towers. Lattice towers, guyed towers, and other non-stealth towers, are not permitted in any zone. Monopoles are excepted, but only as per other sections of this Title.

b.    Monopoles on Private Property in a Residential Zone. Monopoles located on residentially zoned private property, if the residentially zoned property has a residential use (as opposed to a school, church, or other non-residential use). 


11-6-410 Specific Regulations by Type. 

Wireless facilities are characterized by the type or location of the antenna structure. There are four general types of antenna structures contemplated by this ordinance: wall mounted antennas; roof mounted antennas; stealth facilities; and monopoles. If a particular type of antenna structure is allowed by this ordinance as a permitted or conditional use, the minimum standards for that type of antenna are as follows, unless otherwise provided in a conditional use permit: 

a.    Wall Mounted Antennas. 

i.    Maximum Height and projection. Wall mounted antennas shall not extend above the roof line of the building or structure or project more than four (4) feet from the face of the building. 

ii.    Setback. Wall mounted antennas shall not be located within twenty feet (20’) feet of a residential zone unless it is located on a non-residential structure as approved by this title.

iii.    Mounting Options. Antennas mounted directly on existing parapet walls, penthouses, or mechanical equipment rooms are considered to be wall mounted antennas if no portion of the antenna extends above the roof line of the parapet wall, penthouse, or mechanical equipment room. 

iv.    Color. Wall mounted antennas, equipment and supporting structures shall be painted to match the color of the building or structure or the background against which they are most commonly seen. Antennas and the supporting structure on the building shall be architecturally compatible with the building. Whip antennas are not allowed on a wall mounted antenna structure, but may camouflaged in a stealth facility as per stealth requirements of this article. 

v.    Maximum Area. The total area for all wall mounted antennas and supporting structures on any one building shall not exceed five percent (5%) of any exterior wall of the building. 

b.    Roof Mounted Antennas. 

i.    Maximum Height. The maximum height of a roof mounted antenna shall be eighteen feet (18’) above the roof line of the building. 

ii.    Setback. Roof mounted antennas shall be setback from the exterior wall of the building or structure a distance at least equal to the height of the antenna above the roof. 

iii.    Mounting options. Roof mounted antennas may be mounted directly on a roof, or on top of existing penthouses or mechanical equipment rooms if the total height of the antennas do not exceed eighteen feet (18’) above the roof line of the building. 

iv.    Color. Roof mounted antennas, equipment and supporting structures shall be painted to match the color of the building or structure or the background against which they are most commonly seen. Antennas and supporting structures shall be architecturally compatible with the building. 

c.    Stealth Facilities. 

i.    Maximum Height. The maximum height of a stealth facility shall be eighteen feet (18’) higher than the maximum permitted structure height of the zone in which the stealth facility is located. The applicant may exceed the maximum structure height if otherwise allowed in this Chapter, or pursuant to a conditional use permit. 

ii.    Determination. Not every disguised or screened wireless facility qualifies as a stealth facility. Whether or not a particular facility qualifies as a stealth facility shall be decided by the Planning Commission as part of the conditional use permit approval process. In making the decision, the Commission shall consider the definition of Stealth Facilities set forth in this Article and shall consider whether the facility is disguised, blended or screened in a manner that eliminates any negative impact to surrounding properties of the wireless facility. Each stealth facility certification applies to one location only. Because of differing circumstances specific to each site, an antenna that qualifies as a stealth facility in one location may not qualify as a stealth facility in a different location. As a reference, the City will create a guide to illustrate stealth options.

d.    Monopoles. If the applicant desires to construct a monopole, the applicant shall first submit a detailed written description of why the applicant cannot obtain coverage using existing buildings or structures or stealth facilities. Monopoles are not permitted in the City’s nationally registered historic district. 

i.    Maximum Height and Width. The maximum height of the monopole or monopole antenna shall be eighty feet (80’), although the approving body may, as a conditional use, allow an antenna or antenna support structure up to 110 feet (110’) in height, if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the approving body that the additional height is necessary to obtain coverage or to allow co-location, and that the applicant has taken steps to mitigate adverse effects on the surrounding neighborhood. The antenna itself shall not exceed ten feet (10’) in height. 

ii.    Setback. Monopoles shall be set back a minimum of 300% of the height of the monopole from any residential lot line, measured from the base of the monopole to the nearest residential lot line. 

iii.    Color. Monopoles, antennas, and related support structures shall be painted a neutral color, or a color to match the background against which they are most commonly seen. 

iv.    Distance from other Monopoles. Monopoles and towers shall be located at least one half mile from each other. However, a new monopole with co-location space for other future or existing carriers may be permitted closer than a half mile to another legal nonconforming monopole that does not have any collocation space.

v.    Location on Parcel. Monopoles shall be located as unobtrusively on a parcel as possible, given the location of existing structures, nearby residential areas, and service needs of the applicant. Monopoles shall not be located in a required landscaped area, buffer area or parking area. 

vi.    Co-Location Requirement. Every new monopole shall be designed and constructed to be of sufficient size and capacity to accommodate at least two additional wireless telecommunications provider on the structure in the future.


11-6-411 Lease Agreement. 

The City has no implied obligation to lease any particular parcel of City-owned property to an applicant. The City shall enter into a standard lease agreement with the applicant for any facility built on City property. The City Administrator or designee is hereby authorized to execute the standard lease agreement on behalf of the City. The lease shall contain the condition that the site plan and/or conditional use permit must first be approved by the approving authority before the lease can take effect, and that failure to obtain such approval renders the lease null and void. 


11-6-412 Safety. 

a.    Regulation Compliance. 

i.    Compliance with FCC and FAA regulations. All operators of wireless facilities shall demonstrate compliance with applicable Federal Communication Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, including FCC radio frequency regulations, at the time of application and periodically thereafter as requested by the City. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations shall be grounds for revoking a site plan or conditional use permit approval. 

ii.    Other licenses and permits. The operator of every personal wireless services facility shall submit copies of all licenses and permits required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the design, construction, location and operation of the facility to the City, shall maintain such licenses and permits in good standing, and shall provide evidence of renewal or extension thereof upon request by the City. 

b.    Monopole Safety. 

i.    Protection Against Climbing. Monopoles shall be protected against unauthorized climbing by removing the climbing pegs from the lower 20 feet of the monopole. 

ii.    Fencing. Monopoles and towers shall be fully enclosed by a minimum 6-foot tall fence or wall, as directed by the City, unless the approving authority determines that a wall or fence is not needed or appropriate for a particular site due to conditions specific to the site. 

iii.    Security Lighting Requirements. Monopoles and towers shall comply with the FAA requirements for lighting. As part of the conditional use permit consideration, the City may also require security lighting for the site. If security lighting is used, the lighting impact on surrounding residential areas shall be minimized by using indirect lighting, where appropriate. 

c.    Abandonment. The City requires the removal of all antennas and monopoles if the facility has been inoperative or out of service for more than twelve (12) consecutive months. 

i.    Notice. Notice to remove shall be given in writing by personal service, or by certified mail addressed to the operator’s last known address. 

ii.    Violation. Failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after receiving written notice to remove is a violation of the terms of this Chapter. The City may initiate criminal and/or civil legal proceeding against any person, firm, entity or corporation, whether acting as principal, agent, property owner, lessee, lessor, tenant, landlord, employee, employer or otherwise, for failure to remove antennas and monopoles in accordance with this Chapter. The City may seek a civil injunction requiring the removal of any structures on the site in accordance with this Chapter. The City may also remove such structures itself, and may bill its costs in removing the structures to the operator. Any lease agreement with the City may also stipulate failure to remove the antennas and monopoles after receiving written notice to do so pursuant to this Chapter automatically transfers ownership of the antennas, monopoles, support buildings and all other structures on the site to the City. 

d.    Emergency. The City shall have authority to move or alter a wireless facility in case of emergency. Before taking any such action, the City shall first notify the owner of the facility, if feasible.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-603 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Article shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this Article its most reasonable application. The below defined words only apply to this Article and not to any other section within this Title.

“Accessory structure” is a structure that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure. Its use is incidental to the use of the principal structure, and the ownership of the accessory structure is the same owner as of the principal structure. An accessory structure is a nonresidential structure of low value that is used solely for the parking of vehicles and storage of tools, materials, or equipment. No human habitation is allowed within an accessory structure. This definition shall include all other specifics, definitions and exclusions contained in FEMA Policy No. 104-008-03, Floodplain Management Requirements for Agricultural Structures and Accessory Structures (February 2020), and any other pertinent local, State and Federal floodplain laws, rules and regulations.

“Addition” is any improvement that expands the enclosed footprint or increases the square footage of an existing structure. This includes lateral additions added to the side, front, or rear of a structure; vertical additions added on top of a structure; and enclosures added underneath a structure.

“Agricultural structure” is a structure used exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, raising, or drying of agricultural commodities and livestock; and “agricultural structure” specifically excludes any structure used for human habitation. This definition shall include all other specifics, definitions and exclusions contained in FEMA Policy No. 104-008-03, Floodplain Management Requirements for Agricultural Structures and Accessory Structures (February 2020), and any other pertinent local, State and Federal floodplain laws, rules and regulations.

“Alluvial fan flooding” means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform that originates at the apex. It is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths.

“Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.

Appurtenant Structure. See “Accessory structure.”

“Area of future-conditions flood hazard” means the land area that would be inundated by the one percent (1%) annual chance flood, based on future-conditions hydrology.

“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO, AH, AR/AO, or AR/AH zone on the City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1') to three feet (3') where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.

“Area of special flood hazard (SFHA)” is the land in the floodplain within the City subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zone A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, or V1-30, VE, or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term “special flood hazard area” is synonymous in meaning with the phrase “area of special flood hazard.”

“Area of special flood-related erosion hazard” is the land within the City that is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM). After the detailed evaluation of the special flood-related erosion hazard area, in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone E may be further refined.

“Base flood” means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

“Base flood elevation (BFE)” is the water surface elevation of the one percent (1%) annual chance flood event. It is the height in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. It is also the elevation shown on the FIRM and found in the accompanying flood insurance study (FIS) for Zone A, AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, V1-V30, or VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from the flood that has a one percent (1%) chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.

“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. A walkout basement that does not require a step up to grade is not considered a basement.

“Breakaway wall” means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces, without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. Any walls below the lowest floor in a building in a V or VE Zone should give way under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other damage to the elevated portion of the building of the supporting pilings or columns. Breakaway walls are required within V or VE Zones; they can also be used in A Zones.

Building. See “Structure.”

“Channelization” means the artificial creation, enlargement, realignment, or alteration of a stream channel’s slope, shape, or alignment. Streambank restoration may be deemed as channelization.

“Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)” is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government.

“Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)” is FEMA’s comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic and/or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective BFEs, and/or the SFHA. The letter does not revise an effective map; it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be recognized by FEMA.

“Conditional letter of map revision based on Fill (CLOMR-F)” is FEMA’s comment on a proposed structure or property. The letter does not revise an effective map; it indicates whether the project, if built as proposed, would be removed from the floodplain.

“Crawlspace” means an under-floor space that has its interior floor area (finished or not) no more than four feet (4') from the bottom floor joist of the next higher floor elevation, designed with proper openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures of floodwater, and is not used for habitation.

“Critical facility” means a facility or building where even a slight chance of flooding is too great a threat. Typical critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations, police stations, schools, storage of critical records, assisted living and similar facilities.

“Deed restriction” refers to a clause in a deed or other recorded document that limits the future use of the property in some respect. Deed restrictions may impose a vast variety of limitations and conditions. For example, they may limit the density of buildings, dictate the types of structures that can be erected, or prevent buildings from being used for specific purposes or from being used at all.

“Detached garage” is a building that is used solely for storage of materials or vehicle parking for the housing occupants. If a detached garage is designed or used for habitation or conducting business, or has multiple stories, then the building is not considered a detached garage under the NFIP.

“Development” means any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, demolition, excavation or drilling operations, or storage either temporary or permanent of equipment or materials.

“Elevated building” is a non-basement building built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AR, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated floor above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (post and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AR, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, an “elevated building” also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.

“Enclosure” refers to an enclosed walled-in area below the lowest floor of an elevated building. Enclosures below the BFE may only be used for building access, vehicle parking, and storage.

“Erosion” means the process of the gradual wearing away of land masses by wind, water, or other natural agents.

“Existing construction” or “existing structures” refers to structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date.

“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before June 2, 2020.

Existing Structures. See “Existing construction.”

(1)    A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

(a)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, or

(b)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source;

(2)    Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) that are proximately caused by flooding as defined in this Article and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current; or

(3)    The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this Article.

New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to the base flood level plus the freeboard height noted below, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification that includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the Floodplain Administrator. If the use or occupancy of the building changes in the future to residential, then the dry floodproofing of the structure cannot be used when determining compliance of the structure to the residential construction of this Article. As such, the building will not be grandfathered into compliance and will be required to be brought into compliance with the residential construction requirements of this Article.

(4)    Nonresidential Construction Freeboard. The lowest floor elevation for residential construction shall be built two feet (2') above the BFE or flood depth identified on the FIRM. The development and construction of the structure must conform to the provision in FEMA/FIA-Technical Bulletins 1, 2, 10 and 11.

(5)    Nonresidential Construction Access. New development projects will be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, so nonresidential building sites, walkways, driveway, and roadways are located on land with a natural grade with an elevation not less than the BFE and with dry land access.

(6)    Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are to be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a basement, and are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(a)    A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

(b)    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot (1') above grade;

(c)    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; and

(d)    The development and construction of the structure must conform with the provision in FEMA/Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) Technical Bulletins 1 and 2.

(7)    Enclosure Nonconversion Agreement. For any nonresidential construction that has an enclosure, a nonconversion agreement must be completed as part of the permitting process. The nonconversion agreement:

(a)    Acknowledges the risk associated with this building practice;

(b)    Acknowledges the use of the area that was permitted as an enclosure will be used solely for nonresidential accessory or appurtenant structures of low value whose usage is only for building access, parking or storage; and

(c)    Allows for City, State and/or Federal officials to conduct periodic inspections to ensure compliance.

(8)    Crawlspace. New construction and substantial improvements built on a crawlspace or sub-grade (below grade) crawlspace may be permitted if the development is designed and meets or exceeds the standards found in FEMA’s Technical Bulletins 1, 2, and 11, which include but are not limited to the following:

(a)    The structure must be affixed to a permanent foundation, designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet (5') per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer.

(b)    The crawlspace is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot (1') above the LAG.

(c)    The crawlspace enclosure must have proper openings that allow equalization of hydrostatic pressure by allowing automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. To achieve this, a minimum of one (1) square inch of flood opening is required per one (1) square foot of the enclosed area subject to flooding.

(d)    Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, piers, or other materials that extend below the BFE. Ductwork, in particular, must either be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.

(e)    Any building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions.

(f)    The interior grade of a crawlspace below the BFE must not be more than two feet (2') below the LAG.

(g)    The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the lowest interior grade of the crawlspace floor to the bottom of the floor joist of the next higher floor, cannot exceed four feet (4') at any point.

(h)    There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event.

(i)    Buildings with below-grade crawlspaces will have higher flood insurance premiums than buildings that have the preferred crawlspace construction, with the interior elevation at or above the LAG.

(j)    Crawlspaces shall not be allowed if they are not allowed under Section 10-1-105 or any other applicable City Code provisions.

(9)    Manufactured Homes.

(a)    All manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on the City’s FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to any applicable State and City anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

(b)    Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s FIRM on sites outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the BFE, unless a higher standard option was selected, and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

(c)    In A1-30, AH, AO and AE Zones, require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park to be elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the BFE, unless a higher standard option was selected; or the chassis is supported by reinforced piers no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and securely anchored.

(d)    All manufactured homes are placed so that the bottom of the I-beam shall be at or above the BFE in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE on the City’s FIRM plus any applicable freeboard as established by this Article by the City and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

(10)    Recreational Vehicles.

(a)    Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the City’s FIRM must:

(i)    Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;

(ii)    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

(iii)    Meet the permit requirements of Section 11-6-611, “Permit Procedures,” and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes” of this section.

(b)    Recreational vehicles shall comply with all applicable Springville City Code provisions, including, but not limited to, all requirements in Sections 11-6-117 and 11-6-119.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-619 Standards for Subdivision Proposals.

(1)    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with the provisions of this Article.

(2)    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

(3)    All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of this Article.

(4)    BFE data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, or whichever is lesser.

(5)    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

(6)    All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-620 Standards for Subdivision Access.

New subdivision development proposals shall be designed, to the maximum extent practicable, so residential buildings sites, walkways, driveways, and roadways are located on land with a natural grade with elevation not less than the BFE and with dry land access.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-621 Areas of Shallow Flooding.

Areas of shallow flooding are characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:

(1)    All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the City’s FIRM plus the freeboard height described in this Section.

(2)    All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall:

(a)    Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the City’s FIRM (at least two feet (2') if no depth number is specified) plus the freeboard height described in this Section; or

(b)    Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.

(3)    A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this Section are satisfied.

(4)    Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.

(5)    Shallow Flooding Freeboard. The lowest floor elevation shall be built two feet (2') above the BFE or flood depth identified on the City’s FIRM.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-622 Floodways.

Floodways located within SFHAs are extremely hazardous areas due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential; the following provisions shall apply:

(1)    The base flood level shall not be increased by more than one foot (1') in the regulatory floodway on the City’s FIRM.

(2)    Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase greater than zero feet (0.00') during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(3)    All new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Article.

(4)    Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the NFIP Regulations, the City may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in BFEs; provided, that the City first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-623 Properties Removed from the Floodplain by Fill.

A floodplain development permit shall not be issued for the construction of a new structure or addition to an existing structure on a property removed from the floodplain by the issuance of a FEMA letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F), unless such new structure, or substantial improvement or addition complies with the following:

(1)    Residential Construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork) must be elevated to the elevation as required by the applicable sections of this Article.

(2)    Nonresidential Construction. The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to the elevation required by the applicable sections of this Article, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight at the elevation as required by the applicable sections of this Article with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-624 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions, greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes.

This Article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on the part of Springville City or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)


11-6-625 Appeals and Variances.

(1)    The Board of Adjustments shall hear and render a decision on appeals after a floodplain development permit has been denied and on requests for variances from the requirements of this Article.

(2)    Appeals. The Board of Adjustment shall hear and render judgement on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement of administration of this Article. All appeals of a decision made by the Floodplain Administrator shall follow the Board of Adjustment appeal process found in Section 11-2-305.

(3)    Variances.

(a)    Variances may be issued by the Board of Adjustment for new construction, substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of functionally dependent uses; provided, that:

(i)    The criteria outlined in this Section are met; and

(ii)    The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(b)    General Variance Provisions.

(i)    Variances shall not be issued to reduce the freeboard requirements in this Article for residential and nonresidential structures.

(ii)    Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the development meets the listed requirements for a variance. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(iii)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(iv)    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. The term “substantial improvement” does not include any alteration of a structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.

(c)    Requirements for a Variance to Be Granted.

(i)    All variances must meet the requirements for a variance listed under Section 10-9a-702 of the Utah Code Annotated.

(ii)    In addition to the requirements under Section 10-9a-702 of the Utah Code Annotated, variances shall only be issued upon a determination that:

(A)    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in “unreasonable hardship” to the applicant, as that term is defined under Section 10-9a-702;

(B)    The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and

(C)    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, conflict with existing local laws or ordinances, considers the need of ingress and egress during times of floods, and does not jeopardize first responders’ health and welfare.

(d)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the BFE, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(e)    Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this Article, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this Article.

(4)    Records. The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to FEMA and the Utah Division of Water Rights – Stream Alteration Program or any other applicable State agency upon issuing a variance.

(5)    Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment may appeal such decision to the District Court as allowed under Section 10-9a-801 of the Utah Code Annotated.

(Ord. No 12-2020 § 2, 06/02/2020)

Article 1 – AMENDMENTS TO TITLE AND ZONE MAP


11-7-101 Intent.

It is intended that all amendments to this Title shall be made in accordance with the General Plan of the City. It is hereby declared to be public policy that this Title shall not be amended, unless it can be shown that changed or changing conditions make the proposed amendment necessary to the promotion of the purposes of this Title.




11-7-102 Procedure for Amendments.

(1)    All proposed amendments to Title 11 or to the Official Zone Map shall be submitted first to the Planning Commission for its recommendations, which recommendations shall be submitted to the City Council for its consideration.

(2)    Any person seeking an amendment to those Chapters or to the Official Zone Map shall submit to the Planning Commission a written petition designating the change desired and the reasons therefor and shall pay a filing fee in the amount set forth by a resolution of the City Council. All petitions for a zoning change shall include a vicinity map, drawn to scale and showing the names and addresses of the owners of adjacent property, and a legal description of the property for which the change is sought. The fee required herein shall not be returned to the applicant. The Planning Commission may also initiate amendments to this Title or to the Official Zone Map by recommendation of such amendments to the City Council.

(3)    Upon receipt of the completed petition, the Planning Commission shall schedule and hold a public hearing to consider the request and shall certify its recommendation to the City Council with respect thereto.

(a)    The Planning Commission shall provide reasonable notice of the public hearing in accordance with Section 10-9a-205, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended.

(4)    The City Council shall consider the recommendation of the Planning Commission and any written objection filed in accordance with Section 10-9a-205(4), Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, of the proposed amendments to Title 11 or the Official Zone Map after providing notice for a public meeting.

(Ord. No. 8-05, 05/17/2005; Ord. No. 01-2011, 01/18/2011; Ord. No. 06-2015 § 1, 03/17/2015)


11-7-103 Reversion of Zoning.

(1)    If a project plan, which includes a site plan, subdivision or building plan, has not been approved within one (1) year of the establishment of the new zoning classification, or if an approved project plan or preliminary project plan expires following a rezoning, the Planning Commission may initiate a review of the most recent zoning classification. The Commission may choose to recommend rezoning the property to the prior classification or to a new one, or the Commission may recommend keeping the existing zoning in place. Any Commission recommendation to change the existing zoning classification or restore the former classification must be transmitted to the Council and is subject to the procedure for amendments as per Section 11-7-102.

(2)    Denial of an application to amend the zoning map to reclassify any parcel of property shall prohibit the filing of another application to amend the zoning map to reclassify the same parcel of property, or any portion thereof, to the same zone classification within one (1) year of the date of the final denial by the municipal council of the previous application unless the planning and zoning review committee finds that there has been a substantial change in the circumstances or sufficient new evidence as submitted by the applicant in writing since the denial of the previous application to merit consideration of a second application within the one (1) year time period.

(Ord. No. 13-05, 06/07/2005)

Article 2 – CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS


11-7-201 Purpose and Intent.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to establish standards for land uses listed as conditional uses (designated as “C” in Section 11-4-301, Land Use Matrix). Conditional uses are generally similar to permitted uses, but because of unique characteristics or potential impact on the municipality, surrounding neighbors or adjacent land uses, may only be compatible in certain areas and only if certain conditions are required that mitigate or eliminate the detrimental impacts. 


11-7-202 Conditional Use Permit.

A conditional use permit shall be required for all uses listed as conditional in the respective zoning district. This permit may only be issued upon approval of the Planning Commission. A conditional use permit shall make the approved use allowable at the specific location and the right of the approved use with its conditions shall run with the property, unless the permit has expired as provided under Section 11-7-209 or has been revoked as provided under Section 11-7-211. In the event that the conditions cannot be met or a change occurs from the original approval, an amendment to the original conditional use permit shall be required. If the use is discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, a new conditional permit is required.


11-7-203 Review Procedure.

(1)    Pre-Application Meeting – The purpose of the pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for the applicant to present a basic sketch of what is being proposed for the site prior to formal application. The meeting is to be scheduled by the applicant with the Planning Division staff. This meeting will provide a chance to discuss the process, site development standards (setbacks, landscaping, parking, fencing, etc.) and other aspects of the project in a less formal setting, along with identifying major concerns prior to formal application. 

(2)    Formal Application – Application for a conditional use permit shall be made to the Planning Commission at the Springville Community Development Department. The applicant shall prepare and submit a completed application form, payment of review fees, along with the information and required number of copies outlined in Article 4 of this Chapter for site plan approval. All the information required for application shall be provided prior to scheduling the item for the Planning Commission agenda.

Each application for, and instance of, a conditional use shall be considered a unique situation and shall not be construed as precedent for similar requests.

(3)    Development Review Committee Review – The Development Review Committee shall review all applications to determine conformance with all applicable City ordinances and standards. If the site plan is determined to meet City ordinances and standards, the DRC will forward the submission to the Planning Commission. Otherwise, the application will be returned to the applicant for appropriate modification. The application should not proceed to the Planning Commission if it does not meet the requirements of the City Code and other applicable standards, along with the requirements of other reviewing agencies. The DRC may forward applications to the Planning Commission subject to variances, waivers, modifications or amendments being proposed by the applicant. During the meeting the applicant will be given the opportunity to make presentations, ask questions and propose alternative conditions for consideration.

(4)    Notice – Notice of a public hearing to be held by the Planning Commission to consider the conditional use permit shall be given at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing in accordance with the Utah State Code. Additionally, at least seven (7) days prior to the Planning Commission meeting during which the conditional use permit will be considered, the Planning Division may post a sign on each frontage of the subject property stating the proposed use, along with the date, time and location of the meeting during which the conditional use permit will be considered.

(5)    Planning Commission Review and Action – The Planning Commission shall review relevant portions of the completed application, along with comments from the DRC and the Planning Staff report. After review of the item, the Planning Commission may approve, conditionally approve or deny the proposed conditional use permit application. (Ord. No. 05-2010, 04/20/2010; Ord. No. 21-2017 § 1, 09/19/2017)


11-7-204 General Criteria for Consideration of a Conditional Use Permit.

(1)    Conditional use applications shall be reviewed in accordance with the following general criteria:

(a)    Detrimental to Persons or Property – The proposed use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case and the conditions imposed, be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of persons, nor injurious to property and improvements in the community, existing surrounding uses, buildings and structures. In determining the effects to persons or property, the Commission may impose the following conditions:

(i)    Regulation of nuisance factors such as noise, vibrations, smoke, dust, dirt, odors, gases, noxious matter, heat, glare, electromagnetic disturbances and radiation;

(ii)    Water supply and fire protection;

(iii)    Impact on surrounding areas resulting from an unusual volume or character of traffic.

(b)    Use Compatibility – The proposed use at the particular location is compatible with the character of the site, adjacent properties, surrounding neighborhoods and other existing development. In determining the compatibility of the use with the surrounding area, the Planning Commission may impose the following:

(i)    Regulation of operating hours for activities affecting normal neighborhood schedules and functions.

(ii)    Provisions for adequate public services to meet the needs caused by the use, e.g., child care services, social services, etc.

(iii)    Parking facilities, including vehicular ingress and egress and the surfacing of parking areas and driveways to specified standards.

(iv)    Regulation of light and noise.

(c)    Design Compatibility – The proposed site and building plan at the particular location is compatible with the character of the site, adjacent properties, surrounding neighborhoods and other existing development. In determining the compatibility of the site and building plan with the surrounding area, the Planning Commission may consider, among other things, landscaping, screening, parking location, and building design (e.g., mass, height, site work needed to place the building on the lot, building materials, color and site design in relation to emission of odors, light and noise).

(d)    General Compatibility – The proposed use at the particular location is compatible with the intent, function and policies established in the general plan, this Title and the particular zoning district in which the use is proposed.

(2)    Compliance with Regulations – The proposed use will comply with the regulations and conditions specified in this Title for such use.


11-7-205 Specific Criteria for Consideration of a Conditional Use Permit. Revised 7/20

(1)    Rehabilitation/Treatment Facility – Rehabilitation/treatment facilities in the BP and HC Zones must meet conditions that include, but that are not limited to, the following:

12-2-113 Nuisance – Definition. Revised 8/20

This section defines “nuisance” by providing five (5) general definitions of what constitutes a nuisance (subsection (1) of this section), and then providing specific examples of situations, conduct or activities that constitute nuisances (subsection (2) of this section). The purpose of the general definitions is to allow the City to classify an offending situation, conduct or activity as a nuisance, even though the situation, conduct or activity may not be listed as a nuisance in the specific examples. The first three (3) general definitions are taken directly from Utah State law. The purpose of listing the specific examples is to identify some of the specific situations, conduct and activities that the City intends to abate as nuisances. 

(1)    General Definitions of Nuisance. Any activity that meets any one or more of the five (5) definitions set forth below shall constitute a “nuisance” if it occurs within the City of Springville: 

(a)    Nuisance as Defined in U.C.A. §78-38-1(1). Anything which is injurious to health, indecent, offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of Property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or Property. 

(b)    Nuisance as Defined in U.C.A. §76-10-801. Any item, thing, manner, or condition whatsoever that it is dangerous to human life or health or renders soil, air, water, or food impure or unwholesome. 

(c)    Nuisance as Defined in U.C.A. §76-10-803. Unlawfully doing any act or omitting to perform any duty, which act or omission: 

(i)    annoys, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health, or safety of three (3) or more persons; 

(ii)    offends public decency; 

(iii)    unlawfully interferes with, obstructs, or tends to obstruct, or renders dangerous for passage, any lake, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park, square, street, or highway; or 

(iv)    in any way renders three or more persons insecure in life or the use of Property. An act which affects three or more persons in any of the ways specified in this subsection is still a nuisance regardless of the extent to which the annoyance or damage inflicted on individuals is unequal. 

(d)    Nuisance. A condition which: 

(i)    wrongfully annoys, injures, or endangers the comfort, repose, health or safety of others; or 

(ii)    unlawfully interferes with, obstructs or tends to obstruct, or render dangerous for passage, any public park, square, street or highway, or any other public place; or 

(iii)    in any way renders other persons insecure in life, or in the use of Property, and which affects the rights of an entire community or neighborhood, although the extent of the damage may be unequal. 

(e)    Specific Nuisances Listed in Subsection (2). Anything specifically listed as a nuisance in subsection (2), below. 

(2)    Nuisances Enumerated. Every situation, conduct or activity listed below constitutes a nuisance and may be abated pursuant to this chapter. The listed examples are not exhaustive; a situation, conduct or activity not listed below, but coming within one of the general definitions of nuisance listed above, shall also constitute a nuisance.

12-2-114 Exceptions.

No act which is done or maintained under the express authority of an authoritative statute, ordinance or court ruling shall be declared a nuisance. 

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 20-01) 


12-2-115 Responsibility for Nuisances.

The Responsible Person(s) is responsible for abating nuisances pursuant to this ordinance. Any person, whether as owner, agent, or occupant, who creates, aids in creating, or contributes to a nuisance, or who supports, continues, or retains a nuisance, is responsible for the nuisance and is therefore a Responsible Person pursuant to this ordinance. Every successive owner or tenant of a Property or Premise(s) who fails to Abate a continuing nuisance upon or in the use of such Property or Premise(s) caused by a former owner or tenant is responsible therefore in the same manner as the one who first created it. 

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 20-01) 


12-2-116 Finding of Nuisance.

If a Community Officer finds that a nuisance exists, the Community Officer shall attempt to have the Responsible Person Abate the nuisance. Although the Community Officer’s first step in correcting or abating the nuisance will always be to obtain voluntary compliance, the Community Officer may pursue any remedy or combination of remedies available pursuant to this ordinance, State law or common law in order to Abate the nuisance. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the City from engaging in its standard prosecution practices. Therefore, the City may prosecute violators of City ordinances or State laws without first having to comply with the provisions of this ordinance, even though the activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute a nuisance under this ordinance. Nothing in this ordinance shall be interpreted to prevent the City from enforcing applicable City ordinances or building codes without first treating the offending conduct, situation or activity as a nuisance pursuant to this ordinance. 

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 20-01) 


12-2-117 Voluntary Compliance.

This section applies whenever the Community Officer determines that a nuisance exists. 

(1)    Contact. Before taking other steps to Abate the nuisance, the Community Officer shall make a reasonable attempt to secure voluntary correction or Abatement of the nuisance by: 

(a)    contacting the Responsible Person, where possible; 

(b)    explaining the nuisance; 

(c)    requesting the Responsible Person to Abate the nuisance; and 

(d)    setting a reasonable date in person or in writing for the Responsible person to Abate the nuisance by voluntary compliance. 

(2)    No Action. If after a reasonable amount of time, the person responsible for the nuisance has taken no action, the Community Officer may abate the nuisance using one or more of the procedures set forth in this Ordinance, State law, or common law.

(3)    Voluntary Compliance Agreement. If the Community Officer and the Responsible Person agree to terms for abating the nuisance, they shall enter into and sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement. The Voluntary Compliance Agreement is a contract between the City and the Responsible Person in which the Responsible Person agrees to Abate the nuisance within a specified time and according to specified conditions. The Voluntary Compliance Agreement shall include the following terms: 

(a)    the name and address of the Responsible Person; 

(b)    the street address of the nuisance, or a description sufficient to identify the building, structure, Premise(s), or land upon or within which the nuisance is occurring; 

(c)    a description of the nuisance; 

(d)    the necessary corrective action to be taken, and a date or time by which correction must be completed; 

(e)    an agreement by the Responsible Person that the City may inspect the Premise(s) as may be necessary to determine compliance with the Voluntary Compliance Agreement; 

(f)    an agreement by the Responsible Person that the City may Abate the nuisance and recover its costs and expenses to Abate the nuisance, as well as a monetary fine pursuant to this ordinance from the Responsible Person, if terms of the Voluntary Compliance Agreement are not met; 

(g)    an agreement by the Responsible Person acknowledging that he/she waives the right to appeal the Community Officer’s finding that a nuisance exists and waives the right to appeal the specific corrective action required in the Voluntary Compliance Agreement; and 

(h)    an agreement by the Responsible Person that failure to comply with the Voluntary Compliance Agreement may be grounds for criminal prosecution. The Community Officer may grant an extension of the time limit for correcting or abating the nuisance if the Responsible Person has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting or abating the nuisance but unforeseen circumstances render Abatement under the original conditions unattainable. If the Responsible Person complies with the terms of the Voluntary Compliance Agreement, the City shall take no further action against the Responsible Person related to the nuisance described in the Voluntary Compliance Agreement unless the nuisance recurs. 

(Amended by Ord. No. 5-03)

When the Community Officer determines that a nuisance exists, and is unable to secure voluntary correction pursuant to Section 12-2-117, the Community Officer may issue a citation to the Responsible Person. The Community Officer may issue a citation without having attempted to secure voluntary correction as provided in Section 12-2-117 under the following circumstances: 

(a)    when an emergency exists; or 

(b)    when the Community Officer is unable to locate or determine the identity of the Responsible Person. 

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 20-01) 


12-2-119 Other Remedies.

The City may take one or more of the following actions against any Responsible Person who fails to comply with the terms of a Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or a citation: 

(1)    Abatement by the City. 

(a)    The City may Abate a nuisance when: 

(i)    the terms of a Voluntary Compliance Agreement have not been met; or 

(ii)    the requirements of a citation and subsequent Court Order have not been complied with, or; 

(iii)    the condition is subject to summary Abatement as provided for in subsection (b), below. 

(b)    Whenever a nuisance is occurring which constitutes an immediate and emergent threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the City may summarily and without prior notice Abate the condition. Notice of such Abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the Responsible Person as soon as reasonably possible after the Abatement. 

(c)    Using any lawful means, the City may enter upon the subject Property and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to Abatement. The City may seek, but is not required to seek, such judicial process as it deems necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition. 

(d)    The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting or abating the violation shall be billed to the Responsible Person and/or the owner, lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use and/or occupy the Property and shall become due and payable to the City within ten (10) days of actual receipt of the bill (within fifteen days of the mailing date if the bill is mailed). The term “incidental expenses” includes but is not limited to: 

(i)    personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorneys’ fees and costs; 

(ii)    costs incurred in documenting the violation; 

(iii)    hauling, storage and disposal expenses; 

(iv)    actual expenses and costs for the City in preparing notices, specifications and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and inspecting the work; and 

(v)    the costs of any required printing and mailing. 

(2)    Civil Actions. Either the City or any private person directly affected by a nuisance may bring a civil action to Abate or enjoin the nuisance, or for damages for causing or maintaining the nuisance (including the cost, if any, of cleaning the subject Property). The civil action may be brought pursuant to this ordinance or pursuant to State law.

(3)    Abatement by Eviction. Whenever there is reason to believe that a nuisance under section 12-2-113(2)(1 – 6) is kept, maintained, or exists in the City, the City Attorney or any citizen(s) residing in the City, or any person or entity doing business in the City, in his or their own names, may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to Abate the nuisance and obtain an order for the automatic eviction of the tenant of the Property harboring the nuisance. The eviction shall take place as specified in Utah law. 

(4)    Lien for Costs. If a person fails to pay any fines or costs related to nuisance Abatement when due, the City may record a lien on the Property or Premise(s) for the full amount of the unpaid fines and costs. 

(5)    Non-exclusive Remedies. The City may take any or all of these remedies (administrative, civil or criminal) to Abate a nuisance and/or to punish any person or entity who creates, causes or allows a nuisance to exist. The Abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the City or any person to recover damages or penalties for its past existence.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 20-01) 


12-2-120 Inspection.

The Responsible Person may contact the Springville Police Department at anytime after a Voluntary Compliance Agreement is signed or citation is issued to request an inspection of the Abated nuisance. The Community Officer will inspect the Property and include in the report the time and date that the nuisance has been deemed Abated. A request for inspection must be made by the Responsible Person in order to stop any penalty from continuing to accrue.

(Adopted by Ordinance No. 20-01) 


12-2-121 Penalty.

(1)    Monetary Fine. The Responsible Person shall pay the City a monetary fine for each day the nuisance continues after the Completion Date or after the citation date, whichever occurs first. The nuisance shall be considered to continue until the Community Officer approves the Responsible Person’s actions to correct or Abate the nuisance. The amount of the monetary fine shall be as follows: 

(a)    One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day for each day during the first week that the nuisance remains uncorrected or unabated after the Completion Date or citation date; 

(b)    Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per day for each day thereafter until the nuisance is corrected or Abated; 

(c)    The monetary fine shall be cumulative and may not be waived by the Community Officer. Payment of a monetary fine pursuant to this section does not relieve the Responsible Person from the duty to Abate the nuisance as required by the Voluntary Compliance Agreement or the citation. The monetary fine constitutes a personal obligation of the Responsible Person. The City Attorney or his/her designee is authorized to take appropriate action to collect the monetary fine, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in collecting said monetary fine. 

(2)    Imprisonment. The responsible person may be imprisoned for failure to Abate a nuisance as set forth herein for a term not to exceed six months.

(3)    Either Penalty. The Court may issue either a fine or imprisonment or both.

During this two (2) working-day period, any currently valid permits held by the solid waste contractor shall not be revoked or suspended due to failure of the solid waste vehicle to pass inspection.

(4)    The solid waste contractor shall pay a fee in an amount established by City Council resolution for each solid waste vehicle inspected or re-inspected by the City.

(5)    The Superintendent shall give to the owner of each solid waste vehicle that meets the requirements enumerated herein a completed and signed inspection form verifying that the solid waste vehicle has passed inspection.

No. 104-104].

CHAPTER 3 FRANCHISE REQUIRED

Sections:

13-3-101    Non-Exclusive Franchise.

13-3-104    Current Providers.

13-3-105    Nature of Franchise.

13-3-106    Regulatory Approval Needed.

13-3-107    Term.


13-3-101 Non-Exclusive Franchise.

The City is empowered and authorized to issue non-exclusive Franchises governing the installation, construction, and maintenance of Systems in the City’s Rights-of-Way, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. The Franchise is granted through a Franchise Agreement entered into between the City and Provider.

(Statutory Authority UCA 10-8-1 and Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) [P.L. No. 104-104]; adopted by Ordinance No. 20-98) 


13-3-102 Every Provider Must Obtain.

Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every Provider must obtain a Franchise prior to constructing a Telecommunications System or providing Telecommunications Services using the Rights-of-Way, and every Provider must obtain a Franchise before constructing an Open Video System or providing Open Video Services via an Open Video System. Any Open Video System or Service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the Cable TV companies to the extent the City is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular Telecommunications Systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a Franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide Telecommunications Services over the same System, must also obtain a Telecommunications Franchise.

A Franchise is only the right to occupy Rights-of-Way on a non-exclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the Franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased. A Franchise does not excuse a Provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its System on the property of others, including the City’s property. This Section shall not be construed to prohibit a Provider from leasing conduit to another Provider, so long as the Lessee has obtained a Franchise.

(Statutory Authority UCA 10-8-1 and Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) [P.L. No. 104-104]; adopted by Ordinance No. 20-98) 


13-3-104 Current Providers.

Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any Provider acting without a Franchise on the effective date of this Ordinance shall request issuance of a Franchise from the City within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Ordinance. If such request is made, the Provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a Franchise is not granted, the Provider shall comply with the provisions of Subsection 13-9-104,

(Statutory Authority UCA 10-8-1 and Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) [P.L. No. 104-104]; adopted by Ordinance No. 20-98) 


13-3-105 Nature of Franchise.

The Franchise granted by the City under the provisions of this Ordinance shall be a nonexclusive Franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its System on, over and under the Rights-of-Way in order to provide Services.

(1)    Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish requirements for the siting and use of wireless facilities in City-owned rights-of-way in a manner that facilitates the delivery of wireless services within the City, while minimizing associated adverse impacts. The goals of this Chapter are to:

(a)    Provide for the managed development and installation, maintenance, modification, and removal of wireless services infrastructure in the City to provide adequate wireless communications coverage, without unreasonably discriminating against providers of functionally equivalent services including all of those who install, maintain, and operate wireless facilities.

(b)    Promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and specifically, protecting aesthetic values, by reducing the visibility of wireless facilities and structures to the fullest extent possible through techniques including but not limited to camouflage/concealment, design techniques, and undergrounding of wireless facilities and the equipment associated therewith, where possible.

(c)    Encourage the deployment of smaller, less intrusive wireless facilities to supplement existing telecommunications facilities.

(d)    Encourage the location of structures in a manner that is least intrusive to the community.

(e)    Encourage owners and users of antennas and structures to locate them, to the extent possible, where the adverse impact on the community is minimized.

(f)    Enhance the ability of providers to provide such wireless services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.

(g)    Effectively manage wireless facilities in the public right-of-way.

(2)    Scope.

(a)    This Chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of wireless services and systems that require the use of City-owned rights-of-way, including providers of both the system and service, and those providers of the system only. 

(b)    The requirements set forth in this Chapter shall apply to the collocation of small wireless facilities located within right-of-way; the collocation of a small wireless facility on a wireless support structure in the right-of-way; and the installation, modification, or replacement of a utility pole associated with a small wireless facility in the right-of-way. 

(c)    This Chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the City prior to the effective date hereof, whether operating with or without a license. 

(d)    Title 11, Chapter 6, Article 4 of the Springville City Code addresses wireless telecommunications facilities, including macro wireless facilities, in areas outside of the rights-of-way. Macro wireless facilities are not allowed in the right-of-way.

(c)    Other Fees. Providers must also pay all other applicable fees established under the City’s ordinances, resolutions, regulations, rules or policies, specifically including but not limited to fees for excavation permits and business licensing.

(5)    Insurance, Indemnity, and Security. Prior to the execution of master license agreement, a provider must deposit with the City an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond as required by the terms of the master license agreement and shall obtain and provide proof of the insurance coverage required by the master license agreement. A provider shall indemnify, save harmless, and defend the City, its officers and employees, from and against all losses, claims, lawsuits, counterclaims, demands, actions, damages, costs, charges, and causes of action of every kind or character, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in connection with such provider’s wireless facilities or use of the ROW, unless and to the extent caused by the City’s negligence.

(6)    Ordinance Amendments. The City reserves the right to amend its ordinances affecting this Chapter at any time. If there is any inconsistency between provider’s rights and obligations under applicable ordinances as amended and the master license agreement, the provisions of the master license agreement shall govern during its term. Otherwise, provider agrees to comply with any such amendments.

(7)    Inspections. All wireless facilities and provider-owned structures shall be maintained by the provider in a clean and good condition, free of graffiti, rusting, excessive dirt, peeling paint and any and all other aesthetic and safety related problems and blemishes. The City shall have the authority to conduct inspections of the wireless facilities and structures at any time to determine whether such facilities and structures comply with the requirements of this Chapter.

(8)    Removal of Facilities.

(a)    If any wireless facility is deemed abandoned, the provider shall remove its wireless facilities and/or structures within sixty (60) days of the City’s notice of such abandonment and shall repair and restore the ROW to a similar or better condition than at the time of the installation. Failure to do so may result in the City’s removal of the facilities and structures at the provider’s cost. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this Chapter required of a provider shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and restoration of the ROW.

(b)    A wireless facility shall be deemed abandoned if the use of the facility is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, the term of an applicable master license agreement has expired, or the facility has been installed and/or maintained in the ROW without complying to the requirements of this Chapter, and the provider has not removed the wireless facilities within thirty (30) days of any such event.

(c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Chapter, a provider may abandon any underground facilities in place so long as (i) it does not materially interfere with the use of the ROW by any public utility, cable operator or other person or entity, and (ii) the City agrees to allow it to stay in place.

(9)    Additional Requirements. Wireless facilities shall be subject to any additional requirements set forth in the applicable master license agreement and permit.

Article 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS


14-1-101 Title.

The provisions of this title known, cited and referred to as the Subdivision Regulations of Springville City are intended to implement subdivision regulations of the Utah Municipal Land Use Development and Management Act, Utah Code, Title 10, Article 9, Part 6. 


14-1-102 Policies.

(1)    Springville City considers the subdivision of land and the subsequent development of the subdivided plat subject to its control and according to the official general plan of the City for the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical development of the City.

(2)    Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or other menace. Land shall not be subdivided until adequate public facilities and improvements exist and/or proper provision has been made for drainage, water, sewerage, electrical power and capital improvements such as schools, parks, recreational facilities, transportation facilities and improvements.

(3)    The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be properly related to the proposals shown in the General Plan, with accompanying maps and illustrations, along with the capital improvement plan and annual program of Springville City. These regulations are intended to supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and standards contained in the Building Code, zoning ordinance, General Plan with accompanying maps and illustrations, and the capital improvement plan and annual program of Springville City. 


14-1-103 Public Purpose.

Regulation of the subdivision of land and the attachment of reasonable conditions to land subdivision is an exercise of valid police power delegated by the State of Utah to Springville City. The developer has the duty of compliance with reasonable conditions laid down by the City Council for design, dedication, improvement and restrictive use of the land to conform to the physical and economic development of the municipality and to the health, safety and general welfare of the future lot owners in the subdivision and of the community at large. 


14-1-104 Purposes.

These regulations are adopted for the following purposes:

(1)    To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the municipality;

(2)    To guide the future growth and development of the municipality in accordance with the General Plan;

(3)    To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy, to secure safety from fire, flood, and other danger and to prevent overcrowding of the land and undue congestion of population;

(4)    To protect the character and the social and economic stability of all parts of Springville;

(5)    To encourage the orderly and beneficial development of the community through appropriate growth management techniques assuring the timing and sequencing of development, promotion of infill development in existing neighborhoods and non-residential areas with adequate public facilities; 

(6)    To assure proper urban form and open space separation of urban areas; 

(7)    To protect environmentally critical areas and areas premature for urban development;

(8)    To protect and conserve the value of land throughout Springville and the value of buildings and improvements upon the land, and to minimize the conflicts among the uses of land and buildings;

(9)    To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewerage, electric power, schools, parks, playgrounds, recreation and other public requirements and facilities;

(10)    To provide the most beneficial relationship between the uses of land and buildings and the circulation of traffic throughout the municipality, having particular regard to the avoidance of congestion in the streets and highways and the pedestrian traffic movement appropriate to the various uses of land and buildings; 

(11)    To provide for the proper location and size of streets and buildings;

(12)    To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and re-subdivisions of land that will maximize buildable area and insure the orderly layout and use of land, recognizing that this may not allow developers to create irregular lots or use other mechanisms to maximize the number of lots created, but lot design will be in the best interest of current and future residents and the community;

(13)    To ensure proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided land;

(14)    To ensure that public facilities and services are available concurrent with development and will have a sufficient capacity to serve the proposed subdivision and that the community will be required to bear no more than its fair share of the cost of providing the facilities and services through requiring the development to pay fees, furnish land or establish mitigation measures to ensure that the development provides its fair share of capital facilities needs generated by the development;

(15)    To prevent the pollution of air, streams and ponds; to assure the adequacy of drainage facilities; to safeguard the water table; and to encourage the wise use and management of natural resources throughout Springville in order to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the community and the value of the land;

(16)    To preserve the natural beauty, topographic and geologic features of the municipality and to ensure appropriate development with regard to these natural features;

(17)    To provide for open spaces through the most efficient design and layout of the land, including the use of average density in providing for minimum widths and area of lots, while preserving the density of development as established in the zoning ordinance;

(18)    To remedy the problems associated with boundary line disputes; and

(19)    To eliminate existing property line gaps and overlaps, inappropriately subdivided lands, including premature subdivision, excess subdivision, partial or incomplete subdivision, scattered and sub-standard subdivision.

(Amended by Ord, No. 28-2006, 10/17/2006) 


14-1-105 Authority.

In accordance with Section 10-9-108, Utah Code Annotated 1953 and by authority of the Springville City Code, the City Council exercises the power and authority to establish subdivision regulations along with the review, approval, disapproval, and amendment to plats for major subdivision as defined in these regulations.

(2)    No real property, whether wholly or partially within the corporate limits of Springville City, shall be considered legally subdivided unless and until the applicant has completed the procedure for subdivision approval as defined in Chapter 2 of this Title. This includes concept plan, preliminary plan approval, and final plat approval and recordation and filing of the plat with the Utah County Recorder’s Office. 

(3)    No owner or agent of any parcel of land may transfer, sell or otherwise exchange any subdivided real property unless and until the proposed subdivision has been approved by the City Council and filed in the Office of the Utah County Recorder.

(3)    Further, these regulations are not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement or restriction; provided, that where the provisions of these regulations are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other private agreement or restriction, these regulations shall govern. Where any easement, covenant or other private agreement or restrictions are more restrictive or impose a higher standard than these regulations, then the private provisions shall be operative and supplemental to these regulations and conditions imposed; however, Springville City shall not be responsible to enforce those private provisions. 


14-1-108 Provisions, Relationship to Previous Ordinance.

(1)    These regulations shall not be interpreted as abating any action under the previous existing subdivision regulations or in any way affecting any penalty accruing or about to accrue, nor the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or waiving any right of Springville under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations. These regulations shall also not be interpreted as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm or corporation by lawful action of the City.

Article 1 GENERAL SUBDIVISION APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND APPROVAL PROCESS


14-2-101 General Procedure.

Classification of Subdivisions. Before any land is subdivided, the owner of the property to be subdivided, or the owner’s authorized agent, shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures, which includes two (2) steps for minor subdivisions and three (3) steps for subdivisions:

(1)    Minor Subdivision:

(a)    Concept plan;

(b)    Preliminary plan;

(2)    Subdivision:

(a)    Concept plan;

(b)    Preliminary plan;

(c)    Final plat.


14-2-102 Preapplication Meeting.

Before preparing a concept plan for a subdivision, the applicant shall schedule an appointment with the Community Development Department to discuss the procedure for approval of a subdivision plan with regard to zoning requirements. As relevant to the proposed subdivision, general layout of streets and required reservation of land, street improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection and similar matters, as well as the general availability of existing services will also be discussed. The applicant will then be advised, when appropriate, to discuss the proposed subdivision with those officials who must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision plat for which they have responsibility. The Director may also request other members of the Development Review Committee to be present to provide early assistance to the applicant. 


14-2-103 Concept Plan.

(1)    Submission. The applicant shall prepare and submit a concept plan with the accompanying application provided by the Springville Community Development Department, along with the applicable fee. The purpose of the concept plan is:

(a)    To provide an opportunity for the members of the Development Review Committee (DRC) to review the proposal and prepare written comments concerning the general feasibility of the proposed subdivision prior to proceeding with an application for preliminary plat approval; and

(b)    To determine whether or not the plan can comply with the subdivision requirements that include lot configuration, street layout, and general availability of electrical power, water, sanitary and storm sewer facilities in the vicinity of the proposed subdivision property.

(2)    The applicant shall provide a completed application along with a digital copy of the plans in Vector scalable format, for distribution to members of the DRC. The plan shall show the following:

(a)    North point, scale and date of preparation;

(b)    Vicinity map with a one-quarter (0.25) mile radius;

(c)    Names, addresses and phone numbers of the applicant and engineer and/or surveyor for the proposal;

(d)    Proposed lot and street layout;

(e)    Total acreage; and

(f)    Proposed subdivision name.

(3)    Simultaneous Submission of Concept and Preliminary Plans. An applicant may choose to submit both a concept and Preliminary Plan simultaneously for review by the Development Review Committee. If this approach is taken, the applicant needs to be aware that if the DRC determines that changes are needed in the Concept Plan, the Preliminary Plans will need to be corrected to reflect the changes identified by the DRC. Simultaneous submissions will not assure applicants that their preliminary plans will be considered at the next Planning Commission, even if deadlines for that meeting are met by the applicant.

(4)    Staff Action. The Concept Plan shall be distributed to the members of the DRC for their review and comment. The time frame for submissions and review shall be set by policy of the Community Development Department. Members of the DRC should submit their written comments on the Concept Plan to the Community Development Department, with advice to the applicant for specific changes, if any, needed in the layout. Members of the DRC will be invited to attend a meeting with the applicant to discuss concerns with the applicant. Additional changes may be required by the DRC, Planning Commission and City Council as part of the Preliminary Plan and Final Plat approvals for which the applicant will be responsible. While there is no approval of a Concept Plan required or given, the Planning Commission shall not review any Preliminary Plan prior to completion of a Concept Plan reviewed by members of the DRC and a meeting to discuss concerns and recommendations with the applicant. Upon completion of this process, the Planning staff will inform the applicant that the Preliminary Plan may be considered by the DRC. 

(5)    Effective Period of Conceptual Review. The applicant shall have six months from the date of DRC action to prepare and submit a complete application for Preliminary Plan review.

(Adopted by Ord. No. 1-03, amended by 6-03; Ord. No. 21-2017 § 2, 09/19/2017) 


14-2-104 Preliminary Plan.

(1)    After the effective date of this Chapter, no application for a building permit, as set forth in Section 14-5-405(1), shall be approved by the City for any impact-producing residential or nonresidential activity unless the applicant has paid the applicable impact fees in accordance with these procedures and requirements.

(2)    (a)	Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the Chief Building Official shall determine whether the proposed project is impact-producing, and, if so:

(i)    Whether it is a residential or nonresidential activity;

(ii)    The class of residential or nonresidential development and, if residential, the number of dwelling units;

(iii)    If nonresidential, the intensity of development; and

(iv)    The impact fee district in which the proposed project is located.

(b)    After making these determinations, the Chief Building Official shall determine the demand for capital facilities required by the proposed impact-producing development activity and calculate the applicable impact fee, multiplying the demand of the proposed impact-producing development by the impact fee per demand unit, as set forth in the calculation methodology.

(c)    If the type of land use proposed for development is not expressly listed in the specific impact fee ordinance, the Chief Building Official shall:

(i)    Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the impact fee based on the impact fee per demand unit for that land use; or

(ii)    Identify the broader land use category within which the specific land use would fit and calculate the impact fee based on the impact fee per demand unit for that land use category.

(d)    If neither of the alternatives set forth in subsection (2)(c) of this section is appropriate, the demand may be determined by an individual impact analysis performed by the applicant. Any individual impact analysis shall conform to the requirements of the applicable impact fee ordinance and this Chapter.

(e)    The calculation of impact fees due from a multiple-use impact-producing development activity shall be based upon the aggregated demand for each capital facility generated by each land use type in the proposed development.

(f)    The calculation of impact fees due from a phased impact-producing development shall be based upon the demand generated by each phase for which building permit applications are received.

(g)    All impact fees shall be calculated based on the impact fee per demand unit in effect at the time of building permit issuance.

(3)    (a)	Credits against the amount of an impact fee due from a proposed impact-producing development shall be provided for the dedication of land and the provision of capital facilities by an applicant when such land or capital facilities are determined to provide additional capacity to meet the demand generated by the development and when either:

(i)    The costs of such land or facilities have been included in the fee calculation methodology for the applicable category of capital facilities; or

(ii)    The land dedicated or capital facilities provided are determined by the City Council to be a reasonable substitute for the cost of facilities which are included in the applicable fee calculation methodology.

(b)    Applications for credit shall be made to the City Impact Fee Administrator and shall be submitted at or before the time of building permit application. The application for a credit shall be accompanied by relevant documentary evidence indicating the eligibility of the applicant for the credit. When an application for a credit accompanies an application for a building permit, the Chief Building Official shall calculate the applicable impact fee without any credit. Any credit determined appropriate by the City Impact Fee Administrator shall be applied against the impact fee calculated to be due; provided, however, that in no event shall a credit be granted in an amount exceeding the impact fee due.

(c)    Credits for dedication of land or provision of capital facilities shall be applicable only against impact fees for the same category of capital facilities. If the value of the dedication of land or provision of a capital facility exceeds the impact fee due for that capital facility category, the excess value may not be transferred to impact fees calculated to be due from the applicant for other categories of capital facilities nor may the excess value be transferred to other applicants or properties.

(4)    The City shall collect all applicable impact fees at the time of building permit issuance or development approval for a public entity that may develop without written authorization from the City, unless:

(a)    The applicant is not subject to the payment of impact fees; or

(b)    The applicant has taken an appeal and a bond or other surety in the amount of the impact fee has been posted with the City.

(5)    (a)	The applicant may request, and the City may approve or require the submittal by the applicant of, an individual impact analysis if the proposed impact-producing development is a land use type generating unusual demand for one (1) or more types of capital facilities or is a land use type for which the City does not have adequate and current demand data.

(b)    An individual impact analysis shall be performed by an independent consultant agreed upon by the applicant and the City, and shall include:

(i)    The demand generated by the impact-producing development and the methodology used to calculate the demand;

(ii)    Copies of any recorded conditions on the property operating to limit the demand for capital facilities generated by the proposed development;

(iii)    Information and data which may be required by a specific impact fee ordinance; and

(iv)    Any additional information, data or analysis deemed necessary by the City.

(c)    All costs for the preparation, submittal and review of an individual impact analysis shall be borne by the applicant. The costs incurred shall be charged to the applicant regardless of whether the applicant proceeds to building permit issuance, or whether the demand as calculated in the individual impact analysis is accepted or rejected by the City.

(d)    Following the receipt of an individual impact analysis, the City shall provide a written determination of the demand generated by the proposed impact-producing development and may:

(i)    Find that the impact fee shall be calculated based on the demand as set forth in the individual impact analysis;

(ii)    Find that the impact fee shall be calculated based on the demand, as set forth in the individual impact analysis, as modified by the City; or

(iii)    Find that the individual impact analysis does not support a different demand and, therefore, that the impact fee should be calculated based on the demand as calculated pursuant to the impact fee ordinance. The findings of the City shall be set forth in writing and provided to the applicant.

(Ord. No. 04-2012, 04/17/2012)


14-5-407 Establishment of Impact Fee Accounts; and Appropriation of Impact Fee Funds.

(1)    (a)	An impact fee account shall be established by the City for each category of capital facilities for which impact fees are collected. Subaccounts may be established for individual impact fee subdistricts. All impact fees collected by the City shall be deposited into the appropriate impact fee account or subaccount, which shall be interest bearing. All interest earned shall be considered funds of the account. The funds of these accounts shall not be co-mingled with other funds or revenues of the City. The City shall establish and implement necessary accounting controls to ensure that the impact fee funds are properly deposited and appropriated in accordance with this Chapter and other applicable legal requirements.

(b)    Impact fee funds may be appropriated for capital facilities and for the payment of principal, interest and other financing costs on contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the City to finance capital facilities.

(c)    Notwithstanding this Section, impact fee funds may be appropriated or encumbered beyond six (6) years from the beginning of the Fiscal Year in which the fees were collected if the appropriation is for a capital facility which requires more than six (6) years to plan, design, finance and construct. The City shall identify in writing the reasons for the appropriation of impact fee funds beyond six (6) years of collection, and establish a date certain for their expenditure.

(2)    (a)	The City Council, as part of the annual budget process, will identify capital facility projects anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with impact fees. The City Council shall specify the nature of the capital facility, its location, the system capacity added by the improvement, the service area of the improvement, and the timing of completion of the improvement.

(b)    The City Council may authorize impact fee-funded capital facilities at such other times as may be deemed necessary and appropriate. Such capital facilities shall also be described, as set forth above.

(c)    The City Council shall verify that adequate impact fee funds are, or will be, available from the appropriate impact fee accounts for the proposed capital facilities. 


14-5-408 Refunds.

(1)    For efficiency in the processing of refunds the applicant is required to file a written request for a refund with the City and provide the necessary information as identified herein. Except as provided, refunds shall be made only to the current owner of property on which the development activity was proposed or occurred.

(2)    Refunds shall only be made following an affirmative action by the City Council with the finding that: 

(a)    The fees have not been appropriated, encumbered or spent, and 

(b)    That no impact has occurred that would; 

(i)    Increase the need or demand for a capital facility; or 

(ii)    Utilize existing capital facility capacity; or 

(iii)    Cause an existing capital facility level of service standard to decline. The City may, at its option, make refunds of impact fees by direct payment, or by other means subject to agreement with the property owner.

(3)    All impact fee refunds authorized by an affirmative vote of the City Council shall include a pro rata share of interest earned by the applicable impact fee account calculated at the average annual rate of interest for the period the applicant’s impact fees were in the account.

(4)    (a)	An applicant who has paid an impact fee for a proposed impact-producing development activity for which the applicable building permit has been revoked shall be eligible to apply for a refund of impact fees paid.

(b)    An applicant may apply for a refund of impact fees paid if the City has failed to appropriate or encumber the impact fees collected within the time limits established in Section 14-5-406.

(c)    An applicant who has paid an impact fee for a proposed impact-producing development activity for which a building permit has been issued and construction initiated, but which is abandoned prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not be eligible for a refund unless the uncompleted building is completely demolished and removed.

(5)    Applications for a refund shall include all information required by subsection (6) or subsection (7) whichever is applicable. Upon receipt of a complete application for a refund, the City Impact Fee Administrator shall review the application and all documentary evidence submitted by the applicant, as well as such other information and evidence as may be deemed relevant, and make a recommendation to the City Council whether a refund is due.

(6)    Applications for refunds due to the expiration of a valid building permit or abandonment of a development shall be made within sixty (60) days following expiration or revocation of the development permit or demolition of the structure. The applicant shall submit:

(a)    Evidence that the applicant is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner, 

(b)    The amount of the impact fees paid and receipts evidencing such payments, and 	(c) documentation evidencing the expiration or revocation of the development permit or demolition of the structure.

(a)    Evidence that the applicant is the property owner or the duly designated agent of the property owner, 

(b)    The amount of the impact fee paid and receipts evidencing the impact fee payments, and 

(c)    Description and documentation of the City’s failure to appropriate impact fee funds for relevant capital facilities. 


14-5-409 Appeals.

(1)    An appeal from any decision of the Chief Building Official or City Impact Fee Administrator pursuant to this Chapter shall be made in writing within thirty (30) days to the City Council. Within thirty (30) days from the date the appeal is filed, the City Council shall: 

(a)    Conduct an appeal hearing, and 

(b)    Make a final decision on the appeal. The City Council will ensure that all minutes, findings, orders, transcripts and other materials are correct and represent the true and complete record of the proceedings of the appeal hearing. If the notice of the appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the City Attorney in an amount equal to the impact fee due, the application for a building permit for the development activity may be issued by the City. The filing of an appeal shall not stay the collection of the impact fee due unless a bond or other sufficient surety has been provided.

(2)    The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the decision of the Chief Building Official or City Impact Fee Administrator is erroneous. 


14-5-410 Conflict.

Neither this Chapter nor any applicable specific impact fee ordinance shall affect, in any manner, the permissible use of property, density or development, design and improvement standards or other applicable standards or requirements of the City. To the extent of any conflict between other City Ordinances or regulations and this Chapter, the more restrictive is deemed to be controlling.




14-5-411 Severability.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Title is, for any reason, held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Title.

(1)    Where a development includes or requires a capital facility for which the expenditure of impact fees may be spent, as allowed under §14-5-407, the City and the developer may agree in writing to have the developer participate in the financing or construction of part or all of the qualifying improvements. Such agreement may provide for reimbursements, offsets or other appropriate compensation to the developer for the developer’s participation in the financing and/or construction of the improvements.

(2)    The agreement shall include:

The procedures and requirements of this Article shall apply to and govern the processing and requirements and approval of condominium projects and of condominium record of survey maps. This Article shall supplement other provisions of this Chapter and all other zoning, site development, health, building or other ordinances which may be applicable to the particular condominium project, and shall apply to the approval of condominium projects involving new construction, as well as projects involving the conversion of existing structures. In addition, condominium projects in which units are not contained in existing or proposed buildings shall also be considered subdivisions requiring compliance with applicable provisions of this Title. 


14-6-102 Submission of Application.

The owner or developer of a proposed condominium desiring approval shall file an application with the Planning Administrator on a form prescribed by the City together with the following:

(1)    Two (2) copies of the proposed record-of-survey map accurately drawn to scale as required by Section 57-8-13, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, which [map] shall be made by a registered land surveyor using a scale no smaller than one inch to equal 100 feet. In addition, said map or an additional site plan shall reflect the required floor plans, identifying matters of units, convertible and expandable spaces or areas, and common areas. Said map or plan shall designate the intended use of common areas, and shall indicate whether such common areas are to be open to the public, assigned to specific units or semi-private, being available only to unit owners. Said map or site plan shall also identify and describe in detail the location of existing or proposed driveways, pedestrian ways, curb cuts, walls, structures, fences, landscaping and sprinkling systems.

(2)    Two (2) copies, signed in the original, of the proposed condominium declarations and by-laws, together with a copy of the documents recorded after final approval.

(3)    For conversion of an existing building proposed as part of a condominium project, a property report required by Section 10-1-105 of this Code shall be submitted as part of the application, together with the plan for proposed improvements and repairs.

(4)    Proof of notice to tenants required by Section 14-6-109 shall be required before final approval, but may be submitted at developer’s option after preliminary approval is obtained.

(5)    To assist the City to defray costs involved with review of the project, a fee shall be paid with the application in accordance with the City’s current fee schedule.

(6)    Incomplete applications may be proffered and reviewed for advisory comment by the Planning Administrator, but shall not be deemed accepted or received until complete, nor shall the condominium project be scheduled for any hearings before the Planning Commission until the application is complete, excepting only item (4) above. 


14-6-103 Review of Declarations.

Condominium declarations shall be reviewed by the Planning Administrator to assure an inclusion of provisions which, to the City’s satisfaction, address and fix responsibility for the maintenance, upkeep, and repair of common areas, including common walls, electrical, mechanical, plumbing and utility systems, recreational areas, landscaping areas, and parking areas. Also, declarations shall restrict the use of any individual residential dwelling unit to single families as defined by this Title. 


14-6-104 Preliminary Review and Approval of Building Inspector.

Upon receipt of an application for approval of a condominium project, the Building Inspector shall review the proposed building plans for new construction and in the case of a conversion project the property report and plan of improvement repairs, required by Section 10-1-105 of this Code, to determine if such plans comply with the applicable Building Code. In the case of a conversion, the Building Inspector shall require inspection of the property and may require supplementation, revision, and resubmission of the property report should it be determined that substantial discrepancies exist or inspections indicate report statements are not supported by facts, requirements, or sound construction practices. Upon preliminary review, the Building Inspector shall note corrections, repairs, and replacements which must be made to bring the structure into Code compliance, together with a list of renovation improvements proposed by the developer but not required by the Code. The Building Inspector may recommend denial until such time as existing violations of Code are corrected or may recommend preliminary approval of the project and building report, subject to the condition that violations be corrected prior to final approval. 


14-6-105 Preliminary Review by Planning Administrator.

The Planning Administrator shall review the application and related documents to determine whether the project conforms to applicable provisions of the Condominium Ownership Act of 1975, applicable zoning ordinances of the zone in which the condominium project is located, the status or extent of non-conforming rights, applicable conditions on the use or building imposed by ordinance, Board of Adjustment variance, conditional uses, or similar restrictions. If the Planning Administrator finds there are violations of applicable zoning ordinances or other requirements, he may recommend denial of the condominium project until such violations have been corrected, or he may recommend preliminary approval subject to the condition the violations be corrected or bonded prior to final approval. 


14-6-106 Preliminary Approval by Planning Commission.

(1)    Upon submission of the reports and recommendations of the Building Inspector and Planning Administrator, the matter shall be presented for consideration to the Planning Commission for preliminary approval. If the Planning Commission finds that approval is recommended by the Building Inspector and Planning Administrator, and that the project is in compliance with applicable zoning, building, health and subdivision ordinances and requirements, the Planning Commission may grant preliminary approval, and it may impose appropriate conditions subsequent as part of its approval. Such conditions may include correction of violations, appropriate amendment to declarations, and the submission of notice of intent to tenants, to be completed prior to final approval.

(2)    The effect of preliminary approval shall entitle the owner or developer to proceed with obtaining building permits, giving notice to tenants, and preparing documents for final approval, and to otherwise proceed with the project with all aspects thereof being subject and conditioned upon final approval. 


14-6-107 Final Review.

(1)    After preliminary review, the Building Inspector shall cause the structure to be inspected in the normal course of inspection work being done under permit. Prior to final approval, the Building Inspector shall cause final inspections on all structures and work therein to be completed upon the request of the owner of developer to determine conformance to applicable Building Codes. If the Building Inspector finds remaining corrections, repairs, or replacements which are required to bring the buildings or units into compliance or to complete proposed renovations, the Building Inspector may require completion of such items prior to final approval. However, should the Building Inspector determine plans to correct Code violations or to complete proposed renovations after final approval and as a condition thereof are reasonable and shall not create hazards to the health or welfare of the occupant, the Building Inspector may recommend final approval of the plan; provided the developer files a faithful performance bond, complying with Chapter 6 of this Title, in an amount equal to 125% of the estimated cost of labor and materials, to guarantee corrections of violations of Building Codes or conditions imposed by ordinance. Said bond shall be filed with the final record-of-survey map prior to submission to and approval of the condominium project by the City Council.

(2)    After preliminary approval, the Planning Administrator shall be responsible to monitor conditions of preliminary approval to assure compliance therewith prior to presentation to the Planning Commission and City Council for final approval. All violations of existing ordinances or requirements shall be corrected prior to final approval, or shall be completed as a condition of final approval, prior to submission to the City Council, or shall be bonded as provided in paragraph (1) of this Section. The sixty-day (60-day) notice to tenants required by Section 14-6-109 shall commence from the latest date of notice to any tenant and must elapse prior to submission of the condominium project to the City Council for final approval. 


14-6-108 Final Approval.

Following the review provided for by Section 14-6-107, the matter shall be submitted to the Planning Commission, for final approval. Upon final approval by the Planning Commission, the Planning Administrator shall insure that all conditions of approval have been completed, all final documentation is signed and submitted, including any required bonds or agreements, and then shall submit the matter, together with the recommendation of the Planning Commission, to the City Council for final approval. If the City Council shall determine said project is in conformity with the requirements of applicable ordinances, it shall approve the record-of-survey map. If it should determine said project is not in conformity with requirements or ordinances, or if it rejects any offers of dedication, or if it is not satisfied with plans of a project which constitutes a subdivision, it shall disapprove said map, specifying reasons for disapproval. No final map shall have any force or effect until the same has been approved by the City Council, as reflected by the signature of the Mayor, and is recorded with the County Recorder within eighteen (18) months of the date of the Mayor’s signature. 


14-6-109 Notice to Tenants.

(1)    As part of the application for approval of a condominium project, when said project involves the conversion of an existing residential structure, where the structure has been occupied by residential tenants prior to application for conversion, the developer or owner shall provide notice of intended conversion to said tenants by certified mail. This notice requirement shall not apply to non-residential structures or to a residential structure that was vacant upon acquisition by the owner and remains so during the year prior to the filing of the application for conversion; nor shall it preclude the approval of a project where every tenant has executed a waiver relinquishing his or her right of notice under this Section.

(2)    Such notice shall include the intention and plans for the conversion of the building to a condominium project; the estimated date of construction and termination of occupancy, which shall not be less than 60 days from the date notice is served upon occupants or expiration of individual leases, whichever is longer; the disclosure of the specific, initial, fixed, sales price for each unit, which shall be no greater than the price initially advertised and offered to the general public.

(3)    No final approval of a conversion project shall be granted until the developer has provided proof of service by certified mail or subsequent proof of actual delivery by a method of service allowed under Section 78-36-6, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, of such notices as is required above, and the time designated therein, a minimum of sixty (60) days, has expired. 


14-6-110 Enforcement.

(1)    It shall be unlawful for a person, firm, corporation, partnership, or association to sell or lease any unit of a condominium or any other portion thereof until final plats, in full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, have been finally approved by the City Council and duly recorded in the Office of the County Recorder.

(2)    All departments, officials and public employees of the City, vested with the duty or authority to approve or issue permits, shall conform to the provisions of this Article and shall neither accept application nor approve any permit or license for use, construction, or any other purpose in conflict with the provisions hereof.

(3)    Any developer, agent of a developer, owner, successor-in-interest of a developer or owner, tenant, purchaser, builder, contractor, or any other person who violates any of the provisions of this Article or any conditions imposed pursuant to this Article, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided by this Title.	

(4)    This Article may also be enforced by any means available to the City as provided by Chapter 5 of this Title.
