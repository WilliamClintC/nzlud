PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Stephenville, TX. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through 2015, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this publication is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents the title of the Code. The number to the right of the colon represents the sequence of the page within that article; thus, page 3 of Title I of the Code would appear as T1:3.

Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Tassy Spinks, Vice-President, Supplement Department, and Erin Edwards, Supplement Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Staci L. King, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a publication of the City's Code which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 50.2. - Policy, purposes and applicable regulations. 
(A)  This chapter provides for prohibitions on discharges of certain substances into the POTW of the city from all sources, domestic, commercial or industrial. A further purpose of this chapter is to set forth uniform requirements for industrial dischargers into the POTW and to enable the Control Authority to protect the public health in conformity with all applicable state and federal laws relating thereto. 
(B)  The objectives of this chapter are as follows: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will interfere with the normal operation of the POTW or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
(3)  To improve the opportunity to recycle or reclaim the wastewater and to dispose of, recycle or reclaim the sludge generated by the POTW; 
(4)  To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public; 
(5)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and 
(6)  To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject. 
(C)  The regulation of discharges into the POTW under this chapter shall be accomplished through the issuance of permits, as specified herein, and by monitoring and inspection of facilities, according to this chapter. 
(D)  Parts of this chapter are enacted pursuant to regulations established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). All categorical pretreatment standards, lists of toxic pollutants, industrial categories and other standards and categories which have been promulgated by the EPA are incorporated as a part of this chapter, as are EPA regulations regarding sewage pretreatment established pursuant to the Clean Water Act. The city shall maintain current standards and regulations which shall be available for inspection and copying. 
(E)  The city shall have the authority to promulgate such administrative regulations as are from time to time necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this chapter. Public notice of any such proposed regulations shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 14 days prior to promulgation. After such notice, the city shall give interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, views or arguments, with or without opportunity for oral presentation. After consideration of the relevant matter presented, in conjunction with any regulation adopted, the city shall prepare a concise general statement of the basis and purpose of the regulation. 
(F)  The city has developed and implemented procedures to ensure compliance with the requirements of a pretreatment program, including random sampling and analysis of the effluent from industrial users and conducting surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards. Each significant industrial user will be inspected and samples collected and analyzed at least once a year. The city will also evaluate, at least once every year during the annual inspection, whether each significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges.

Such information shall be considered subject to public disclosure; provided, however, that the discharger may request that information not be subject to public disclosure, in accordance with 40 CFR 2, as follows: 
(1)  A discharger may assert a business confidentiality claim covering part of all of the information, in a manner described below, and that information covered by such a claim will be disclosed only by means of the procedure set forth below; and 
(2)  If no claim of business confidentiality is asserted, all information will be subject to public disclosure without further notice to the discharger. 
(B)  A discharger which is submitting information to the Control Authority may assert a business confidentiality claim covering the information by placing on (or attaching to) the information, at the time it is submitted to the Control Authority, a cover sheet, stamped or typed legend or other suitable form of notice employing language such as "trade secret," "proprietary" or "company confidential." Allegedly confidential portions of otherwise nonconfidential documents should be clearly identified by the discharger and may be submitted separately to facilitate identification and handling by the Control Authority. If the discharger desires confidential treatment only until a certain date or until the occurrence of a certain event, the notice should so state. 
(C)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the disclosure of information and data regarding the nature and content of a discharger's effluent, the frequency of discharge or a standard or limitation to be met by discharger, and this information shall be available to the public with no restrictions.

Sec. 50.22. - Special rules for industrial discharges. 
(A)  Compliance with standards. 
(1)  Upon the promulgation of the categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter. 
(2)  State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this or any other applicable chapter. 
(3)  No discharger shall increase the use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the pretreatment requirements set forth in this chapter. 
(4)  The Control Authority may impose mass limitations on dischargers where the imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate. 
(B)  Slugloads or accidental discharges. 
(1)  Definition. For purposes of this division (B), a slug discharge is any discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, including but not limited to an accidental spill or a noncustomary batch discharge. The results of such activities shall be available to the Approval Authority upon request. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements: 
(a)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(b)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(c)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate the prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; and 
(d)  If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(2)  Prevention of accidental discharges. Each discharger shall provide prudent protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the discharger's cost and expense. When applicable, detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Control Authority for review, and shall be approved by the Control Authority before construction of the facility. Each existing discharger as designated by the Control Authority shall complete its plan and submit same to the Control Authority within 60 days after the effective date of this chapter. No designated discharger proposing to connect or contribute any wastewater to the POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge protection procedures have been approved by the Control Authority. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Control Authority shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(3)  Notice of accidental discharges or "slugloads." 
(a)  Dischargers shall notify the Control Authority orally as soon as practicable but not later than within 24 hours following the occurrence of a "slugload" or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this chapter. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. 
(b)  A written report shall also be provided within five days of the occurrence. The written report shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. The Control Authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)  Notification shall not relieve the discharger of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the discharger of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law. 
(4)  Liability due to accidental discharges or "slugloads". Any discharger who discharges "slugloads" or prohibited materials shall be liable, pursuant to Sec. 50.89, for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW caused thereby, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the Control Authority on account thereof under state and federal law. 
(5)  Instructions to employees. Each employer shall instruct all applicable employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures including the proper telephone number and/or extension number of the Control Authority to be notified. 
(C)  Bypass. 
(1)  Definitions. 
(a)  Bypass. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
(b)  Severe property damage. Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which cause them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (C)(3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  (a)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
(b)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  (a)  Bypass is prohibited and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless the following occurred: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and/or 
3.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) of this division (C). 
(b)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (4)(a) of this division (C).

(A)  The Control Authority may inspect the facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger shall allow the Control Authority or its representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable times, for the purposes of inspection, sampling or examination of records. Any employee, agent or other representative of the Control Authority who enters private property shall observe the establishment's rules and regulations concerning safety, internal security and fire protection, and if the property has management in residence, shall notify management or the person then in charge of his/her presence and shall exhibit proper credentials. The Control Authority shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are reasonably necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, metering and/or measuring operations. 
(B)  Any discharges of wastewater or other waste into the POTW shall be subject to inspection and/or sampling as often as may be deemed necessary by the Control Authority. Sample shall be collected in such manner as to be representative of the character and concentration of the wastewater or waste under operating conditions. Upon specific request, the Control Authority shall provide the discharger with a split set of all discharge samples taken. The laboratory methods used in the examination of the waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR 136. Regular inspections and/or sampling shall be conducted at such times and on such schedules as may be established by the Control Authority. Should a discharger desire that a scheduled inspection and/or sampling be conducted at some time other than that scheduled by the Control Authority, such inspection and/or sampling may be conducted by the Control Authority at the expense of the discharger. 
(C)  Unscheduled inspections may be conducted whenever deemed by the Control Authority to be reasonably necessary to ensure that the terms of this chapter are complied with. 
(D)  The failure or refusal of a discharger to allow the access required by this section shall be grounds for the disconnection of water and/or sewer service to the discharger's facility, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter applicable to enforcement and/or termination of service.

Sec. 50.25. - Flow measurement. 
(A)  The water consumption during the previous month, as determined from the meter records of the city water department, shall be the basis for computing the sewage flow from any discharger, unless actual sewage flow is measured by a recording meter of a type approved by the Control Authority. The discharger shall install and maintain the recording meter in proper condition to accurately measure the flow. Upon failure to do so, the meter consumption shall be the basis for computing the sewage flow. 
(B)  When water is contained in a product or is evaporated or is discharged as unpolluted wastewater in an uncontaminated condition to surface drainage (in compliance with this chapter and all state and federal law), an application may be made for a reduction in the computed volume of waste discharged to the POTW, provided supporting data satisfactory to the Control Authority is furnished. Such data shall include a flow diagram and other indication of the destination of water supply and/or wastewater, supported by data from meters installed on such process piping at the expense of the discharger. 
(C)  Any discharger who procures any part or all of his/her water supply from a source or sources other than the city, any of which is discharged into the POTW, shall install and maintain at his/her expense an effluent meter and/or other flow measuring device of a type approved by the Control Authority for the purpose of determining the proper volume of flow to be used in computing sewer flow. Such meters or measuring devices shall be read monthly.

Surfactants, solvents and emulsifiers are materials that allow the grease to pass from the trap into the collection system, and include, but are not limited to, enzymes, soap, diesel, kerosene, terpene and other solvents. 
(b)  It is an affirmative defense to an enforcement of division (D)(6)(a) above that the use of surfactants or soaps is incidental to normal kitchen hygiene operations. 
(c)  Bioremediation media may be used with the POTW's approval if the person requesting use of bioremediation media has proved to the satisfaction of the POTW that laboratory testing, appropriate for the type of grease trap to be used, has verified that: 
1.  The media is a pure live bacterial product that is not inactivated by the use of domestic or commercial disinfectants and detergents, strong alkalis, acids and/or water temperatures of 160°F (71°C). 
2.  The use of the media does not reduce the buoyancy of the grease layer in the grease trap and does not increase the potential for oil and grease to be discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
3.  The use of the bioremediation media does not cause foaming in the sanitary sewer. 
4.  The BOD, COD and TSS discharged to the sanitary sewer after use of the media does not exceed the BOD, COD and TSS that would be discharged if the product were not being used, and the grease trap was being properly maintained. pH levels must be between 5 and 11. 
(d)  All testing designed to satisfy the criteria set forth in division (D)(6)(c) shall be scientifically sound and statistically valid in the opinion of the POTW. All tests to determine oil and grease, TSS, BOD, COD, pH and other pollutant levels shall use appropriate tests that have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and which are defined in 40 CFR 136 or 30 Texas Administrative Code § 319.11. Testing shall be open to inspection by the POTW, and shall meet the POTW's approval.

ARTICLE IV. - WATER CONSERVATION PLAN 
 
Sec. 51.40. - Definition; objective. 
(A)  Definition. In the V.T.C.A. Water Code, water conservation is defined as follows: 
(1)  The development of water resources; and 
(2)  Those practices, techniques, and technologies that will reduce the consumption of water, reduce the loss or waste of water, improve the efficiency in the use of water, or increase the recycling and reuse of water so that a water supply is made available for future or alternative uses. 
(B)  Objective. Based upon these concepts of water conservation, Stephenville's objective is to develop a Water Conservation Plan that increases water use efficiency, thereby reducing water demands, without adversely affecting population and the economic growth potential of its customers. 
(Tex. Water Code § 17.001(23)(A), (B); Am. Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.41. - Goals. 
(A)  (1)  The objective of Stephenville's Water Conservation Plan is to promote and publicize water conservation methods that will enable Stephenville to meet its goal of reducing the 2009-2013 five-year average annual per capita water use of 104 gallons per person per day (gpcd) by approximately one and one half percent, or 1.56 gpcd to 102.4 gpcd by 2019, and by three percent to 100.9 gpcd by 2024. 
(2)  This municipal per capita water use statistic includes water used within the home for drinking, toilet flushing, bathing, food preparation, dishwashing, laundry, cleaning, and outdoor uses at home, including landscape irrigation, car washing, and outside cleaning. In addition to the water used at homes, the municipal per capita water use statistic includes a person's share of water used in the workplace for toilet flushing, drinking, cleaning, and lawn irrigation of commercial properties. Outside the home uses also include the water used in commercial establishments such as restaurants, laundries, and car washes. Institutional water use, such as water used in schools, churches, recreation centers, and water used by cities for fire protection, sanitation, and public recreation, is also included in the municipal per capita water use statistic. However, the municipal per capita water use statistic does not include use of any water for industrial purposes. The annual per capita water use statistic includes the municipal per capita water use as well as the water used for industrial purposes. 
(B)  Stephenville plans to accomplish its water conservation goal through the water conservation methods listed and described in this Plan. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008; Am. Ord. 2014-08, passed 4-1-14)  
Sec. 51.42. - Methods. 
Stephenville's Water Conservation Plan includes the following water conservation methods, which are described in the sections that follow: 
(A)  Statute; 
(B)  Public Information and Education; 
(C)  Universal Metering and Record Management; 
(D)  Meter Testing, Repair, and Replacement; 
(E)  Leak Detection, Repair, and Minimization of Conveyance Losses; 
(F)  Rate Structure; 
(G)  Low-Flow Plumbing Fixtures; 
(H)  Water-Conserving Landscaping Education; 
(I)  Additional Water Conservation Strategies; 
(J)  Wholesale Water Contracts; 
(K)  Implementation, Enforcement, Coordination with the Regional Water Planning Group (RWPG); and 
(L)  Updating of the Plan. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.43. - Statute. 
(A)  Because landscape watering is believed to be responsible for up to 50% of summer water usage, the reduction of lawn and garden watering will help control peak demands, extend the city's water supplies, maximize the use of existing treatment and capacity systems and reduce the potential for summer watering restrictions. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, business or other entity other than establishments primarily engaged in (1) growing nursery products, nursery stock, shrubbery, bulbs, fruit stock, sod, and similar vegetation, under cover or in open fields and/or (2) growing short rotation woody trees with a growth and harvest cycle of ten years or less for pulp or tree stock as defined by the North American Industry Classification System, at any time of the year to: 
(1)  Operate an automated in-ground irrigation system on any day of the week between 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Landscape watering is permitted any time with a hand-held hose, soaker hose, bucket, watering can, bubbler or drip irrigation system. A spray type irrigation system may be used any time for the purposes of cooling golf course tee or putting surfaces with run cycles of less than five minutes. 
(2)  Wash any motor vehicle at any location other than a commercial car wash, car dealership, detail shop or automotive shop unless the hose is equipped with a positive shutoff nozzle. Such nozzle shall stop the flow of water through the hose when released by the operator. 
(3)  Install a new irrigation system unless designed by a licensed professional recognized by the state to design water conserving irrigation systems. Each new system shall utilize zonal irrigation, drip irrigation, subsurface irrigation or other water conserving features as appropriate. When application for the irrigation permit is requested by other than a licensed irrigation specialist or landscape architect, the irrigation system plans shall be made available to city building officials. 
(B)  A waiver of the above division may be granted for the irrigation of new landscaping plants whereby watering would be permitted to maintain adequate growth until plants are established, but not to exceed a 30-day time period. Waivers for other activities may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Waivers will not be available when criteria triggering a drought response have been or are initiated. Any person desiring a waiver must make application to the city Public Works Department and pay a $50.00 nonrefundable fee. The applicant must agree to pay a water rate that is three times the current rate for all consumption over 12 CCF (1 CCF=748 gallons, therefore 12 CCF=8,976 gallons) as registered by residential meters and for all consumption as registered by water only meters or commercial meters. Persons desiring a waiver for new landscapes shall exclusively utilize water-use-efficient trees, shrubs, ground covers, ornamental plants and turf; and are to utilize water wise horticultural practices, including proper soil preparation and the use of mulch, compost and zonal irrigation systems. Helpful information regarding plants and practices may be found on links from the city web pages.

Sec. 51.44. - Public information and education. 
(A)  Stephenville's program of public information and education will be expanded to inform water users of the importance of water conservation, and will provide information to water users as to how this can be accomplished in the home, at work, and in public places where individuals use water. Public information and education can work in two ways to accomplish water conservation. 
(1)  One way is to inform water users of how to manage and operate existing and new fixtures and appliances so that less water is used. 
(a)  The procedures to be used include: 
1.  Pamphlets on water conservation issued to new water customers; 
2.  Toilet leak detection kits issued to new water customers; 
3.  Announcements concerning water conservation on the city's news channel; 
4.  Printed water conservation tips on monthly water bills throughout the year; 
5.  Additional water conservation information posted on the city web page as well as links to: 
A.  Texas Smartscape; www.txsmartscape.com; 
B.  Texas Water Development Board (TWDB); www.twdb.state.tx.us; 
C.  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ); www.tceq.state.tx.us; 
6.  City of Stephenville Water Conservation Committee Optimist Park Water Wise Garden. 
(b)  The public information will include ideas and practices such as: 
1.  Washing full loads of clothes and dishes; 
2.  Using a bucket of water instead of a flowing hose to wash cars and windows; 
3.  Turning the water off while brushing teeth or washing hands; and 
4.  Watering lawns, gardens, and shrubs during evening (as opposed to daytime) hours. 
(2)  The second way public information and education can work to conserve water is to inform and convince water users to: 
(a)  Obtain and use water-efficient plumbing fixtures and appliances; 
(b)  Adopt low water-use landscaping plans and plants; 
(c)  Find and repair leaks; and 
(d)  Take advantage of water conservation incentives where available. 
(B)  Stephenville will use the resources of the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), the American Water Works Association, and the American Public Works Association to assist in obtaining publications and materials for the public education program. Individual pamphlets and flyers provided from these entities will be selected for specialized water-conservation needs as they arise.

Sec. 51.45. - Universal metering and record management. 
(A)  The city employs metering devices on all source water diversions. The meters are capable of measuring the amount of water diverted/pumped to within plus or minus five percent. In addition, the city currently meters all water supply connections, using meters that are capable of measuring accurately within plus or minus five percent. In addition, a regularly scheduled maintenance program of meter repair and replacement will be performed in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  Production (master) meters will be tested annually; 
(2)  Meters larger than one inch will be tested annually; and 
(3)  Meters one inch or smaller will be tested or replaced once every ten years. 
(B)  Additionally, computerized water billing reveals above normal water usage at individual connections, allowing staff to identify inaccurate or leaking meters. Meters identified in this manner are investigated, followed by testing, repairs, or replacement as needed. All zero consumption accounts are checked to determine if water is actually being consumed and not recorded. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.46. - Meter testing, repair, and replacement. 
(A)  The city employs metering devices on all source water diversions. The meters are capable of measuring the amount of water diverted/pumped to within plus or minus five percent. In addition, the city currently meters all water supply connections, using meters that are capable of measuring accurately within plus or minus five percent. In addition, a regularly scheduled maintenance program of meter repair and replacement will be performed in accordance with the following schedule: 
(1)  Production (master) meters will be tested annually; 
(2)  Meters larger than one inch will be tested annually; and 
(3)  Meters one inch or smaller will be tested or replaced once every ten years.

Sec. 51.47. - Leak detection, repair, and minimization of conveyance losses. 
Stephenville operates and maintains the water transmission system within the city. In order to maintain water delivery service and to reduce and control unaccounted for water, Stephenville staff routinely visually inspect the transmission system to identify abnormal conditions indicating leaks. The staff is equipped to respond and repair equipment and pipeline breaks or employ contract assistance as required. As a result of these measures, unaccounted-for water is about 8.90 percent. The goal is to reduce unaccounted-for water to 15 percent or below. The TCEQ (formerly TNRCC) considers unaccounted-for water uses of 15 percent or less acceptable for communities serving more than 5,000 people. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.48. - Rate structure. 
Stephenville has a non-promotional rate structure for water service. The city's current water rates should be verified through the most current fee schedule. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.49. - Low-flow plumbing fixtures. 
(A)  The use of water-efficient plumbing fixtures such as toilets, showerheads, and faucets in new construction, and in replacement of existing plumbing fixtures as maintenance and repair are required can also lower water consumption. Water-efficient plumbing fixtures are designed for low quantities of flow per unit of use. In 1991 the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 587 (V.T.C.A. Health & Safety Code, §§ 372.001 et seq.), establishing minimum standards for plumbing fixtures sold within Texas. The water-efficient "Plumbing Fixture Act" became effective on January 1, 1992 and allowed for wholesalers and retailers to clear existing inventories of pre-standards plumbing fixtures until January 1, 1993. The standards, as specified by Senate Bill 587, are shown in the table below. 
Minimum Standards for Plumbing Fixtures 
Fixture 	Standard 
Wall-mounted flushometer toilets 	2.00 gallons per flush 
All other toilets 	1.60 gallons per flush 
Shower heads 	2.75 gallons per minute at 80 psi 
Urinals 	1.00 gallon per flush 
Faucet aerators 	2.20 gallons per minute at 80 psi 
Drinking water fountains 	Shall be self-closing 
 
(B)  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has promulgated rules requiring the labeling of both plumbing fixtures and water-using appliances sold in Texas. The labels must specify the rates of flow for plumbing fixtures and lawn sprinklers, and the amounts of water use per cycle for clothes washers and dishwashers. 
(C)  The TWDB estimates that the installation of the new plumbing fixtures in dwellings, offices, and public spaces could reduce per capita water use by about 22 gallons per day. The estimated conservation effect is shown in the table below. The TWDB estimates that the installation of the low-flow plumbing fixtures in new construction and in replacement of fixtures in existing structures will phase in most of this conservation effect by the year 2020. 
Estimated Water Savings Associated with New Plumbing Fixtures 
Fixture 	Water Savings (gpcd) 
Low-flow toilets (1.6 gallons per flush) 	14 
Shower heads 	5.5 
Urinals 	2.1 
Faucet aerators 	0.3 
Drinking water fountains 	0.1 
Total 	22 
 
(D)  In addition to the conservation potential of new plumbing fixtures, a degree of conservation can be accomplished by using more efficient water-using appliances (e.g., dishwashers and washing machines), modifying lawn and landscaping plans to use grasses and plants that require less water, improved leak detection, and educating the public on personal water conservation techniques. Stephenville will make related information available through its public information and education program.

Sec. 51.50. - Water-conserving landscaping. 
(A)  Water-conserving landscaping is a development concept that encourages residents to adopt low-water-using landscaping principles and methods for use around the home. The same concepts can be applied to other landscaped areas as well, including parks and other public places. 
(B)  One popular method of reducing water use for landscape irrigation is to encourage residents to use xeriscaping techniques for landscaping. There are seven generally adopted principles when planning a xeriscaped yard: 
(1)  Planning and design. During this step an appropriate plan is developed considering such variables as climate, existing vegetation, intended use of the space, and topographic features. 
(2)  Soil analysis. Examine the soil types covering the whole site. 
(3)  Appropriate plant selection. Plants should be selected which are native to the area or are adaptive to the site. 
(4)  Practical turf areas. Plan where turf areas should be located and consider increasing the area of decks, porous paving, paths, and mulched planting beds to reduce turf. 
(5)  Efficient irrigation. Landscaped areas should only be watered as needed and then usually during the early morning or late evening to avoid water lost due to evaporation, keeping in mind some plant species may experience mold and/or fungus growth if watered at night. 
(6)  Use of mulches. A three- to four-inch layer of mulch should cover all exposed soil areas and be replenished twice a year. 
(7)  Appropriate maintenance. Keep the yard well maintained to reduce the use of fertilizer, chemicals, and water.

Sec. 51.51. - Additional conservation strategies. 
The city will select any combination of the following strategies, in addition to those strategies listed above, if they are necessary to achieve the stated water conservation goals of this Water Conservation Plan. The TCEQ may also require that any of the following strategies be implemented by the city if the TCEQ determines that the strategy is necessary to achieve the goals of this Water Conservation Plan. The additional strategies that may be implemented are: 
(A)  Revision of water rates to promote increased water conservation; 
(B)  Additional programs to encourage the retrofit of water-conserving plumbing fixtures in existing structures; 
(C)  Wastewater reuse and/or recycling of wastewater and/or greywater; 
(D)  A program for pressure control and/or reduction in the distribution system and/or for customer connections; 
(E)  Any other conservation practice, method, or technique which the city shows to be appropriate to achieving the stated goal or goals of this Water Conservation Plan. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.52. - Wholesale water contracts. 
For every wholesale water contract entered into or renewed after official adoption of this Water Conservation Plan, including any contract extensions, the wholesale water customer must develop and implement a water conservation plan or water conservation measures according to TCEQ guidelines. If the customer intends to resell the water, then the contract between the initial supplier and customer must provide that the contract for the resale of the water must have water conservation requirements so that each successive customer in the resale of the water will be required to implement water conservation measures in accordance with TCEQ guidelines. (Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003; Am. Ord. 2008-02, passed 2-5-2008)  
Sec. 51.53. - Implementation, enforcement, coordination with the regional water planning group; updating of the plan. 
(A)  The city Director of Public Works will act as the Administrator of the water conservation program. The Administrator will oversee the execution and implementation of all elements of the program. The Administrator is responsible for maintaining adequate records for program verification. 
(B)  The Stephenville City Council has approved, by resolution, the Water Conservation Plan. A copy of the resolution is included in Appendix B attached to the approving ordinance. Implementation of the plan, excluding the statute described in section 51.43, shall be on a voluntary basis, supported by the public information and education program. 
(C)  Stephenville is located within the Region G Regional Water Planning Area. In accordance with the TCEQ rules, Stephenville has provided a copy of this Water Conservation Plan to the Region G Regional Water Planning Group. A copy of the transmittal letter is included in Appendix C attached to the approving ordinance. 
(D)  The Administrator will monitor the progress of the Water Conservation Plan, using information from water utility records and staff. Additionally, the Administrator will be responsible for submission of an annual report to the TCEQ and TWDB on the progress, and any changes to, the Water Conservation Plan.

Secs. 51.5451.98. - Reserved.  
Sec. 51.99 - Penalty. 
(A)  Whoever violates any provision of this chapter for which another penalty is not specifically provided, shall be punished as set forth in section 10.99. 
(B)  (1)  No person shall knowingly or intentionally allow the use of water from city for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental or any other purpose in a manner contrary to any provision of sections 51.10 through 51.19, or in an amount in excess of that permitted by the drought response stage in effect at the time pursuant to action taken by the Mayor, or his/her designee, in accordance with provisions of sections 51.10 through 51.19. 
(2)  Any person who violates sections 51.10 through 51.19 is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $10.00 and not more than $500.00. Each day that one or more of the provisions is violated shall constitute a separate offense. If a person is convicted of three or more distinct violations of these sections, the Mayor shall, upon due notice to the customer, be authorized to discontinue water service to the premises where such violations occur. Services discontinued under such circumstances shall be restored only upon payment of a reconnection charge and any other costs incurred by the city in discontinuing service. In addition, suitable assurance must be given to the city that the same action shall not be repeated while the Drought Contingency Plan is in effect. Compliance with this Plan may also be sought through injunctive relief in the district court. 
(3)  Any person, including a person classified as a water customer of the city, in apparent control of the property where a violation occurs or originates shall be presumed to be the violator, and proof that the violation occurred on the person's property shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the person in apparent control of the property committed the violation, but any such person shall have the right to show that he/she did not commit the violation.

APPENDIX A. - DISCUSSION OF WATER CONSERVATION GOALS 
The technical potential for reducing per capita water use is the range in potential water savings that can be achieved by implementing specific water conservation measures. The bottom of the range represents the potential savings under an "advanced" conservation scenario. The conservation measures include: 
Reducing unaccounted-for water uses; 
Reducing indoor water use due to water-conserving plumbing fixtures; 
Reducing seasonal water use; and 
Reducing water use through public education programs. 
Guidelines for calculating the technical potential water savings for each of these conservation measures are given below. 
1.  Reducing unaccounted-for water uses. The TCEQ (formerly TNRCC) considers unaccounted-for water uses of 15 percent or less acceptable for communities serving more than 5,000 people. Smaller, older systems that have a larger service area may legitimately experience larger losses. Losses above 15 percent may be an area of concern, and provide a conservation potential. 
2.  Reducing indoor water use due to water-conserving plumbing fixtures. The TCEQ uses 20.5 gpcpd as the most reliable figure upon which to base potential water savings, which represents the "most likely" conservation scenario. This figure is based upon the estimate that by 2050, 90 percent of pre-1990 homes, and all new homes will have been equipped with water conserving plumbing fixtures. 
The figures used for the "advanced" conservation scenario, 21.7 gpcpd is an estimate of the average savings that would result from a home equipped exclusively with water conserving plumbing fixtures. This figure is considered "advanced" because in a typical city, 100 percent of the homes are not exclusively equipped with water-conserving fixtures. 
3.  Reducing seasonal water use. The Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) has calculated seasonal use as a percentage of average annual per capita use for East Texas (20 percent), West Texas (25 percent), and state wide average of 22.5 percent. Seasonal water use is calculated by multiplying the average annual per capita use in gpcpd by the appropriate percentage. 
The technical potential for reduction in seasonal use is then calculated by multiplying the seasonal use by seven percent for the "most likely" conservation scenario, and by 20 percent for the "advanced" scenario. 
4.  Reducing water use through public education programs. The technical potential for water conservation from public education programs is estimated to be from two percent of the average annual per capita use for the "most likely" conservation scenario to five percent for the "advanced" scenario, according to the "Water Conservation Handbook," published in 1993 by the American Water Works Association. 
To calculate the total technical potential for reducing municipal per capita water use, add the individual technical potential amounts. 
Summary of Technical Potential Calculations 
Conservation Measure 	Calculation Procedure 	Result (gpcd) 
Reducing unaccounted-for uses 	(Dry-year demand (134 gpcd)) x (Unaccounted-for percentage if more than 15%, minus 15%) 	0 to 0.15 
Reducing indoor water use due to water-efficient plumbing fixtures 	20.5 gpcd ("rule of thumb") to 21.7 gpcd (advanced) 	20.5 to 21.7 
Reducing seasonal water use 	Seasonal use (Avg. use (134 gpcd) x 22.5%) x 7% and 20%) 	2.1 to 6.0 
Reducing water use through public education programs 	Average use (134 gpcd) x 2% and 5% 	2.7 to 6.7 
	Total Technical Potential Savings	25.3 to 34.6 
 
To calculate the long-run planning goal, subtract these totals from the dry-year water demand.

Coordination with the Regional Water Planning Group(s) 
The water conservation plan must include documentation of coordination with the regional water planning group(s) for the service area of the public water supplier in order to ensure consistency with the appropriate approved regional water plans. 
Example statement to be included within the water conservation plan: 
The service area of the ______________(name of water supplier) is located within the ____________(name of regional water planning area or areas) and ____________(name of water supplier) has provided a copy of this water conservation plan to the ____________(name of regional water planning group or groups). 
"Sec. 51.12 COORDINATION WITH REGIONAL WATER PLANNING GROUPS. 
The service area of the city is located within the Brazos Region G Planning Group, and the city has provided a copy of this Plan to the Brazos Region G Regional Planning Group. 
(Ord. 1999-8, passed 5-4-1999; Am. Ord. 1999-19, passed 7-6-1999; Am. Ord. 2000-8, passed 4-18-2000; Am. Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003)" 
Additional Requirements: 
(Required of suppliers serving a population of 5,000 or more or a projected population of 5,000 or more within ten years) 
1.  Program for Leak Detection, Repair, and Water Loss Accounting. The plan must include a description of the program of leak detection, repair, and water loss accounting for the water transmission, delivery, and distribution system in order to control unaccounted-for uses of water. 
See Section 51.47 below: 
Sec. 51.47. Leak detection, repair, and minimization of conveyance losses. 
Stephenville operates and maintains the water transmission system within the city. In order to maintain water delivery service and to reduce and control unaccounted-for water, Stephenville staff routinely visually inspect the transmission system to identify abnormal conditions indicating leaks. The staff is equipped to respond and repair equipment and pipeline breaks or employ contract assistance as required. As a result of these measures, unaccounted-for water is about 8.90%. The goal is to reduce unaccounted-for water to 15% or below. The TCEQ (formerly TNRCC) considers unaccounted-for water uses of 15% or less acceptable for communities serving more than 5,000 people. 
(Ord. 2003-21, passed 8-26-2003) 
Plan Review and Update 
Beginning May 1, 2005, a public water supplier for municipal use shall review and update its water conservation plan, as appropriate, based on an assessment of previous five-year and ten-year targets and any other new or updated information. The public water supplier for municipal use shall review and update the next revision of its water conservation plan not later than May 1, 2009, and every five years after that date to coincide with the regional water planning group. The revised plan must also include an implementation report. 
Best Management Practices Guide 
On November 2004, the Texas Water Development Board's (TWDB) Report 362 was completed by the Water Conservation Implementation Task Force. Report 362 is the Water Conservation Best Management Practices (BMP) Guide.

(A)  General specifications. No concrete shall be placed unless the subgrade, forms and reinforcement have been checked and approved by the Director of Public Works or his/her agent. Concrete shall be deposited on a moist subgrade. During placing, the concrete shall be thoroughly spaded next to the forms and shall be carefully tamped, using an approved tamper, in uniform layers not exceeding six inches in depth, until a uniformly dense concrete is obtained. No concrete over 30 minutes old or retempered concrete shall be used. After the placing of the concrete has sufficiently advanced, the concrete shall be struck off with a "mule" cut to the exact section as shown in Figure 2 of Appendix A the typical details for curb and gutters. If the contractor elects to use a mortar topping on the curb and gutter-section to facilitate finishing, a first pass over the rough concrete may be made with a "mule" which will strike off as much as ¼ inch short of finish grade. If this method is used, the topping must follow the initial placement immediately. The finish mule must be cut to the exact section shown in Figure 2 of Appendix A of the typical details for curb and gutters and must in no case fall more than 50 feet behind the initial strike-off. Any section which is allowed to attain initial set before the application of the topping, or which has in any way been handled in a manner which would tend to jeopardize the complete bonding of the two courses will be removed and replaced at the direction of the Director of Public Works or his/her agent. As soon as the concrete has set sufficiently to retain its shape without support of the forms, the clamps and spreaders may be removed. Forms shall remain in place at least 24 hours after completion of work. All honeycombed areas disclosed by removal of forms shall be immediately corrected by use of cement mortar. The top of all the work and the face of all curbs will be checked for irregularities as soon as the surface is finished, using a ten-foot straightedge; all variations greater than ¼ inch in ten feet shall be immediately corrected. All curbs and gutters shall be marked every five feet and a ½-inch premoulded joint of like cross-section shall be installed at every eighth mark and at all points of curvature and tangency at intersections. Three No. 4 round, smooth dowel bars 24 inches long shall be installed at each of these expansion joints. One-half of the dowel shall be coated with asphalt and terminated with an expansion cap. 
(B)  Subgrade. The subgrade shall be scarified, mixed, reshaped by balding, sprinkled and tamped to 95% standard proctor density at approximately optimum moisture. The process shall be performed to the end that a minimum six-inch layer of compacted subgrade is secured immediately below the bottom of the curb and gutter and extending one foot beyond the back of curb. The subgrade shall be checked for grade, and any portion thereof which falls below the grades shown on the plans shall be filled to plan grade with sand at the expense of the contractor. 
(C)  Forms. The forms shall be of wood or metal, straight and free from warp, and of sufficient strength to resist springing during the process of depositing and compacting the concrete. Straight forms of wood shall be two-inch nominal thickness surfaced plank, or of metal of an approved section with a flat surface on top and bottom. Curved forms shall be used on radii and may be of flexible wood or metal. These forms shall be of a depth equal to the depth of the concrete section in which they are in contact and so designed as to permit securely fastening together in correct position. Forms shall be securely staked, braced and firmly held to the required line and grade, using approved spreaders and clamps, and shall be sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of mortar. All forms shall be cleaned thoroughly and wetted before the concrete is placed against them. 
(D)  Finishing. Finishing will commence as soon as the concrete is workable. An edging tool, so designed to cut a radii is to be used on the back edge of the curb, the street edge of the gutter and at points where dividing plates were placed. The entire area of the curb and gutters is to be brushed with a moist brush to a carpet finish. Sections where dividing plates have been left in until the structure was fractured when they were removed will not be accepted and will have to be taken out and removed. The contractor will take proper steps to protect the structure. The Director of Public Works, or his/her agent, will be the sole judge as to any additional steps for protection to the curb and gutter. 
(E)  Curing. Concrete shall be cured with the application of a two membrane curing compound. This liquid membrane-forming compound for curing concrete pavement shall conform to the requirements of A.S.T.M. Designation C309 for Type 2, White Pigmented Compound (other colors will not be permitted). The material shall have minimum flash point of 80°F when tested by the "Pensky-Martin closed cup method." When applied at the proper consistency through an anatomizing nozzle by means of approved pressure equipment, the compound shall produce a fine mist which shall provide a firm, continuous, uniform moisture impermeable film, free from pinholes, which shall adhere satisfactorily to the surface of the damp concrete without running off or appreciably sagging. Under normal conditions and at the specified rate of coverage, the material shall be dry to the touch in not more than four hours. During the curing period of 72 hours, the material shall not disintegrate, check, peel or crack. 
(F)  Backfilling, sloping and finishing. As soon as the curb forms are removed, backfilling of the curb will commence. It is important that backfilling be given special attention to protect the new curb. Select material shall be used for backfill, which will not include rocks or other foreign material that might damage the curb. Backfill shall be thoroughly compacted and neatly graded off of the top of the curb. When the curb and gutter are constructed in residential areas, the top four inches of backfill dirt will be topsoil or other approved soil which will support the growth of lawn grasses. All construction materials, items of excavations and other foreign matter collected during the process of construction, will be disposed of in an acceptable way before the job is accepted.

(B)  In the event any person shall fail to repair any damage to existing pavement or shall construct a gutter which is not on the level with existing pavement, the city shall repair such damage and correct any defective gutter and assess the cost therefor. In addition thereto, the property owner or contractor shall be subject to the penalty provided in this chapter.

(Ord. 2000-11, passed 5-16-2000)  
Sec. 95.65. - Construction obligations. 
In connection with the construction, expansion, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of facilities, to manage public rights-of-way pursuant to the city's historic rights under state and federal laws as a custodian of public property, a person is subject to reasonable police power regulations of the city. Such regulations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(A)  At the city's request, a person shall provide the city with accurate and complete information relating to the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance and repair of facilities performed in the public rights-of-way. 
(B)  A person may be required to place certain facilities within the public rights-of-way underground. This shall be according to applicable city requirements and absent a compelling demonstration by the person that, in any specific instance, such a requirement is not reasonable, feasible or equally applicable to other similar users of the public rights-of-way. 
(C)  A person shall perform operations, excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way in accordance with all applicable city requirements. This includes the obligation to use trenchless technology whenever commercially economical and practical, and consistent with obligations on other similar users of the public rights-of-way. The city shall waive the requirement of trenchless technology if it determines that, based upon information provided by the person, the field conditions warrant the waiver. All excavations and other construction in the public rights-of-way shall be conducted so as to minimize interference with the use of public and private property. In order to minimize such interference, a person shall follow all reasonable construction directions given by the city. 
(D)  As reasonably required by applicable city codes, prior to any excavation, construction, installation, expansion, repair, removal, relocation or maintenance of the person's facilities, a person must obtain a permit. A construction permit is not required for routine maintenance that does not require excavation of the public rights-of-way. A construction permit is also not required for routine maintenance that does not block traffic lanes or sidewalks during peak traffic periods (between 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekdays) or for more than two hours during any non-peak traffic periods. Once a permit has been issued, a person shall give to the city a minimum of 48 hours notice (which could be at the time of the issuance of the permit) prior to undertaking any of the above listed activities on its facilities in, on or under the public rights-of-way. The failure of the person to request and obtain a permit from the city prior to performing any of the above listed activities in, on or over any public rights-of-way (except in an emergency as provided for in division (K) below) will subject the person to a stop-work order from the city and enforcement action pursuant to this code. If the person fails to act upon any permit within 90 calendar days of issuance, the permit shall become invalid, and the person will be required to obtain another permit. 
(E)  When construction, expansion, reconstruction, removal, excavation or other work has been completed, the person shall promptly restore the public rights-of-way in accordance with applicable city requirements. Within 30 calendar days after completion of the work in accordance with existing city standards then in effect, a person shall replace and properly replace and repair the surface, base, irrigation system and landscape treatment of any public rights-of-way that may be excavated or damaged by reason of the erection, construction, maintenance, or repair of the person's facilities. The city can extend this 30-day deadline for good cause. 
(F)  Upon failure of a person to perform any such repair or replacement work, and if repairs have still not been initiated five days after the city has given written notice to the person, the city may repair such portion of the public rights-of-way as may have been disturbed by the person, its contractors or agents. Upon receipt of an invoice from the city, the person will reimburse the city for the costs so incurred within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice. 
(G)  Within two years from the date of the completion of the repair work, should the city reasonably determine that the surface, base, irrigation system or landscape treatment requires additional restoration work to meet existing city standards, a person shall perform such additional restoration work to the satisfaction of the city, subject to all city remedies as provided herein. 
(H)  Notwithstanding the foregoing in section 95.66, if it determines that the failure of a person to properly repair or restore the public rights-of-way constitutes a safety hazard to the public, the city, after providing emergency notice, may undertake emergency repairs and restoration efforts to the extent reasonable under the circumstances. Within 30 calendar days from the date of the city invoice, a person shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city. 
(I)  At least five business days before beginning construction or reconstruction that involves an alteration to the surface or subsurface of the public rights-of-way, a person shall provide the city with construction plans and maps showing the location and proposed routing of new construction or reconstruction. A person may not begin construction until the location of new facilities and proposed routing of the new construction or reconstruction and all required plans and drawings have been approved in writing by the city. Taking due consideration of the surrounding area and alternative locations for the facilities and routing, such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. 
(J)  If the City Administrator declares an emergency with regard to the health and safety of the citizens and requests by written notice the removal or abatement of facilities, a person shall remove or abate its facilities by the deadline provided in the City Administrator's request. The person and the city shall cooperate to the extent possible to assure continuity of service. If, after notice, the person fails or refuses to act, the city may remove or abate the facility, at the sole cost and expense of the person, without paying compensation to the person and without the city incurring liability for damages. 
(K)  Except in the case of customer service interruptions and imminent harm to property or person ("emergency conditions"), a person may not excavate the pavement of a street or public rights-of-way without first complying with city requirements. The City Administrator or designee shall be notified as promptly as possible regarding work performed under such emergency conditions, and the person shall comply with the requirements of city standards for the restoration of the public rights-of-way. 
(L)  Within 60 days of completion of each new permitted section of a person's facilities, the person shall supply the city with a complete set of "as built" drawings for the segment in a format used in the ordinary course of the person's business to the extent they are prepared in the ordinary course of business, but excluding customer-specific, proprietary or confidential information, as reasonably prescribed by the city and allowed by law. The city may, at its discretion, accept in lieu of "as-built" drawings, any reasonable alternative that provides adequate information as to the location of facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(M)  The city may require reasonable bonding requirements of a person, as are required of other entities that place facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(N)  In determining whether any requirement under this section is unreasonable or unfeasible, the City Administrator or his/her designee shall consider, among other things, whether the requirement would subject the person or persons to: 
(1)  An unreasonable increase in risk or service interruption, 
(2)  An unreasonable increase in liability for accidents, 
(3)  An unreasonable delay in construction or in availability of its services, or 
(4)  Any other unreasonable technical or economic burden. 
(Ord. 2000-11, passed 5-16-2000)  
Sec. 95.66. - Conditions of public rights-of-way occupancy. 
(A)  In its exercise of governmental functions, the city has first priority over all other uses of the public rights-of-way. The city reserves the right to: 
(1)  Lay sewer, gas, water and other pipelines, cables and conduits; 
(2)  Do underground and overhead work, and attachments, restructuring or changes in aerial facilities in, across, along, over or under a public street, alley or public rights-of-way occupied by a person; and 
(3)  Change the curb, sidewalks, or the grade of streets. 
(B)  The city shall assign the location in or over the public rights-of-way among competing users of the public rights-of-way with due consideration to the public health and safety considerations of each user type. To the extent it can demonstrate that there is limited space available for additional users, the city may limit new users, as allowed under state or federal law. 
(C)  If the city authorizes abutting landowners to occupy space under the surface of any public street, alley, or public rights-of-way, the grant to an abutting landowner shall be subject to the rights of the previously authorized user of the public rights-of-way. If it closes or abandons a public rights-of-way that contains a portion of a person's facilities, the city shall close or abandon such public rights-of-way subject to the rights of the person. 
(D)  If the city gives written notice, a person shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of the person's facilities that are in the public rights-of-way within 120 days. Exceptions to this time limit will be granted for circumstances that require additional time, as reasonably determined by the city based upon information provided by the person. For projects expected to take longer than 120 days to remove, change or relocate, the city will confer with the person before determining the alterations to be required and the timing thereof. The city shall give notice whenever it has determined that removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, operation, repair, maintenance or installation of a city governmental public improvement in the public rights-of-way. This section shall not be construed to prevent a person's recovery of the cost of relocation or removal from private third parties who initiate the request for relocation or removal. Nor shall it be required if improvements are solely for beautification purposes without prior joint deliberation and agreement with the person. 
(E)  If it fails to relocate facilities in the time allowed by the city in this section, the person may be subject to liability to the city for such delay as set forth in the city code or ordinances, now or hereafter enacted. 
(F)  Notwithstanding anything in division (D), the City Administrator and a person may agree in writing to different timeframes than those provided above, if circumstances reasonably warrant such a change. 
(G)  A person may trim trees in or over the public rights-of-way for the safe and reliable operation, use and maintenance of its facilities. All tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with standards promulgated by the city. Should the person, its contractor or agent fail to remove such trimmings within 24 hours, the city may remove the trimmings or have them removed. Upon receipt of a bill from the city, the person shall promptly reimburse the city for all costs incurred within 30 working days. 
(H)  If the city gives written notice of no less than 48 hours, persons shall temporarily remove, raise or lower aerial facilities to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures. The party or parties requesting and benefitting from these temporary rearrangements shall pay for their expense. The person may require prepayment or prior posting of a bond from the party requesting the temporary move. 
(Ord. 2000-11, passed 5-16-2000)  
Sec. 95.67. - Insurance requirements. 
(A)  A person shall obtain and maintain insurance in the amounts reasonably prescribed by the city, with an insurance company acceptable to the city and licensed to do business in the state. A person shall furnish the city with proof of insurance at the time of the request for construction permits. The city reserves the right to review the insurance requirements and to reasonably adjust insurance coverage and limits when the City Administrator determines that changes in statutory law, court decisions, or the claims history of the industry or the person require adjustment of the coverage. For purposes of this section, the city will accept certificates of self-insurance issued by the state, or letters written by the person in those instances where the state does not issue such letters, which provide the same coverage as required herein. However, for the city to accept such letters, the person must demonstrate, by written financial information provided at the city's request, that it has adequate financial resources to be a self-insured entity as reasonably determined by the city.

____________ 
Published in 2018 by Order of the City Council 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    This volume constitutes Title XV (Zoning Code) of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Stephenville, Texas. 
Section Numbering System 
    The section numbering system used in this publication of the Stephenville Zoning Code is the same as that employed in the Stephenville Code of Ordinances. Inasmuch as the Zoning Code is referenced in the Stephenville Code of Ordinances as Title XV, the first part of the section number is the chapter number followed by a dash and a number representing a section number within the Zoning Code. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this publication is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents the title of the Zoning Code. The number to the right of the colon represents the sequence of the page within that article; thus, page 3 of Title XV of the Zoning Code would appear as T15:3. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees.

    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Any costs incurred by the city in securing, removing or demolishing the buildings or structures may be charged to the owner. The city may assess the expenses on, and the city shall have a lien against, the property on which the building was located, unless the property is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution. The lien arises and attaches to the property at the time the notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in which the property is located. The notice of lien must contain the name and address of the owner if that information can be determined with a reasonable effort, a legal description of the real property on which the building was located, the amount of expenses incurred by the municipality, and the balance then due; or 
(2)  Acting by and through the building and standards commission, assess a civil penalty under applicable state law not exceeding $1,000.00 per day for failure to repair, remove or demolish the building or structure. Notice of the hearing in which the civil penalty will be considered shall be given to the owner by personally serving the owner with written notice; or by sending the notice in the United States mail by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the owner at the owner's post office address at least ten days prior to the administrative hearing. Before holding a hearing to consider a civil penalty, the board shall have evidence that the property owner was actually notified of the requirements of the order and his need to comply with such requirements. Any civil penalty assessed shall be imposed as a lien against the land on which the building stands or stood, unless it is a homestead as protected by the Texas Constitution, to secure the payment of such civil penalty. 
Promptly after the imposition of the lien, the city shall file for record, in recordable form in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the land is situated, a written notice of the imposition of the lien.

ARTICLE III. - PROCEDURE FOR NOTICE OF HEARING AND HEARING BEFORE BUILDING COMMISSION 

Sec. 151.131. - Notice to owner, lienholder or mortgagee of hearing. 
    Upon notification from the building official that he, or his designee, has determined that a building or structure is a dangerous building or structure as defined in this article, and does not meet the minimum standards for continued use and occupancy, the building commission shall cause a notice of hearing to be issued to the owner, lienholder and mortgagee of the alleged dangerous building or structure. The notice of hearing must be sent by certified mail at least ten days prior to the hearing and must include a statement that the owner, lienholder or mortgagee will be required to submit at the hearing proof of the scope of any work that may be required so that the building or structure will not constitute a dangerous building or structure and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work. The building official or his designee shall make a diligent effort to discover each mortgagee and lienholder for purposes of giving them notice and an opportunity to comment at the hearing. The records in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the building or structure is located shall be used to determine, if possible, the identity and address of any owner, lienholder or mortgagee of the building or structure. The city may file notice of the hearing in the official public records of real property in the county in which the property is located. The notice shall contain the name and address of the owner of the affected property if that information can be determined from a reasonable search of the instruments on file in the office of the county clerk, a legal description of the affected property and a description of the hearing. The filing of the notice is binding on subsequent grantees, lienholders or other transferees of an interest in the property who acquire such interest after the filing of the notice and constitutes notice of the hearing on any subsequent recipient of any interest in the property who acquired such interest after the filing of the notice. 
(Ord. 2018-O-11 , § 1, 3-6-2018) 
Sec. 151.132. - Hearing. 
    On the date set forth in the notice, the building commission shall hold a hearing to determine whether the building is a dangerous building or structure as defined in section 26-91. If the building commission determines that the building or structure is a dangerous building or structure, the building commission may order that the building be vacated, secured, repaired, removed or demolished by the owner within a reasonable time as provided by this article. In addition, if there is a mortgagee or lienholder, the building commission may provide in the order an additional reasonable time as provided by this section for the ordered action to be taken by any mortgagee or lienholder in the event the owner fails to comply with the order within the time provided for action by the owner. No notice to any mortgagee or lienholder shall be required other than a copy of the order in the event the owner fails to timely take the ordered action. The owner of the building or the lienholder or mortgagee may present proof at the hearing of the scope of any work that may be required so that the building or structure will not be a dangerous building or structure and the time it will take to reasonably perform the work. 
(Ord. 2018-O-11 , § 1, 3-6-2018) 
Sec. 151.133. - Findings of fact. 
    The building commission shall make written findings of facts from the testimony offered, pursuant to section 26-132, as to whether or not the building in question is a dangerous building within the terms of section 26-91. 
(Ord. 2018-O-11 , § 1, 3-6-2018) 
Sec. 151.134. - Copy of order to owner. 
    After the hearing, a copy of the order issued by the building commission, if any, shall be promptly mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the building. 
(Ord. 2018-O-11 , § 1, 3-6-2018) 
Sec. 151.135. - Filing and publishing order. 
    Within ten days after the date that the order is issued, the city shall:

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
State Law reference- Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods, Definitions. 

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS, DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 152.01. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Tex. Water Code, § 16.315, delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulation designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the municipality of Stephenville, Texas does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. 2011-17, passed 9-6-2011) 
Sec. 152.02. - Findings of fact. 
(A)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Stephenville are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(B)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 2011-17, passed 9-6-2011) 
Sec. 152.03. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public harm and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(A)  Protect human life and health; 
(B)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(C)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(D)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(E)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(F)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
(G)  Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. 2011-17, passed 9-6-2011) 
Sec. 152.04. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
(A)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
(B)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(C)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(D)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
(E)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 2011-17, passed 9-6-2011) 
Sec. 152.05. - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

(D)  The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) upon request. 
(E)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(F)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 152.37(B) of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(G)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter. 
(H)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(I)  Variances may be issued for the repair and rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(J)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(K)  Variances may be issued by the city for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
(1)  The criteria outlined in divisions (A)-(I) of this section are met; and 
(2)  The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

Sec. 152.53. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones). 
(A)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 152.21, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
(B)  Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
(a)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM; or 
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Section 152.37, are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 2011-17, passed 9-6-2011) 
Sec. 152.54. - Floodways. 
(A)  Located within area of special flood hazard established in Section 152.21, are areas designated as floodways. 
(B)  Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If division (B)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction, within this subchapter, "Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction." 
(3)  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Ch. 1, § 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by § 65.12.

(8)  Any other information as required by the decision-making bodies. 
(b)  Design guidelines. 
(1)  The sign design guidelines are designed to help ensure quality signs that communicate their message in a clear fashion; however, the "guidelines" are not as strict as sign "standards." The Building Official may interpret the design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific signs/projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each sign or project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case. The overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed. 
a.  Compatibility with surroundings. 
1.  Proportional size and scale. The scale of signs should be based on the building facade on which they are placed and the area in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be proportional with the scale of the structure. Large storefronts such as big boxes will be allowed to have proportionally larger signs than smaller storefronts. Signs should not overwhelm the section of the building facade on which it is placed upon. 
2.  Integrate signs with the building. Signs should be designed so that they are integrated with the design of the building. A well designed building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design, and a coordinated color scheme. Signs in multiple-tenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building. Sign placement and design should be reviewed within the context of building design. 
3.  Corporate franchise signage. Corporate franchise signage should conform to the community's visual desires while maintaining some elements of corporate identity. Corporate logos should fit the context, color, scale and building elements. 
b.  Location and mounting. 
1.  Signs should be mounted in locations that respect the design of a building and site, including the arrangement of bays and openings. Signs should not obscure windows, (including second-story windows), window trim/molding, grillwork, piers, pilasters, and other ornamental features. 
2.  Attached signs on fascias above storefront windows should be sized to fit within existing friezes, lintels, spandrels, and other such features and not extend above, below, or beyond them. Typically, attached signs should be centered on horizontal surfaces (e.g., over a storefront opening). 
3.  When a large building contains several storefronts, signs for the individual businesses should relate well to each other in terms of locations, height, proportion, color, and illumination. Maintaining continuity will reinforce the building's facade composition while still retaining each business's identity. 
c.  Color. 
1.  Avoid using too many colors. Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided. 
2.  Use contrasting colors. Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. A substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible. Light letters on a dark background work best for both day and night time use. 
d.  Materials. 
1.  Compatibility of materials. Sign materials should be compatible with the design of the facade on which they are placed. Consider the architectural design of the building's facade and select materials that complement the design. The selected materials should also contribute to the legibility of the sign. For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections. 
2.  Appropriate materials. Sign materials should be extremely durable. Paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use (except on awnings) because they deteriorate quickly. If wood is used, it should be properly sealed to keep moisture from soaking into the wood and causing the sign's lettering to deteriorate. 
e.  Sign legibility. 
1.  Concise name identification. A concise name or limited lines of copy should be used whenever possible given the limited amount of time the vehicle traveling public has to identify and read the sign. The fewer number of words, the more effective the sign. A simple and succinct sign is easier to read and looks more attractive because it is less cluttered. 
2.  Use symbols and logos. Symbols and logos can be used in place of words whenever appropriate. Pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewer's mind than a written message. And they can be an expression of the owner's creativity. 
3.  Limit the number of letter styles. The number of lettering styles that are used on a sign should be limited in order to increase legibility. As a general rule, limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs. Intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate. 
f.  Sign illumination. 
1.  Internal illumination. Individually illuminated letters, either internally illuminated or backlit solid letters (reverse channel) are a preferred alternative to internally illuminated plastic cabinet signs. Signs comprised of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structure's facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure. 
2.  Use a projected light source. Signs along roadways with slower moving traffic or in pedestrian-oriented environment should consider illumination by a projected light source (e.g., spotlight). Projection lighting is usually a better alternative because the sign will appear to be integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures supported in front of the sign cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the building's face as well. Projected lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's surface and signs become an integral part of the facade. The use of small, unobtrusive fixtures for external (projection) lighting is encouraged. Avoid the use of oversized fixtures that are out of scale with the sign and structure. Whenever projection lighting is used (fluorescent or incandescent), care should be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public right-of-way. Signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for nighttime readability. 
3.  Cabinet signs. The use of internally illuminated cabinet signs is discouraged. When such signs are proposed, the background field is required to be opaque so that only the lettering appears illuminated (e.g., routed or push-through lettering/graphics). When the background is not opaque, the entire sign face becomes bright and the sign becomes visually separated from the building. As a result, this type of sign can disrupt the continuity of the facade. 
4.  Electrical raceways and conduits. Electrical transformer boxes and raceways are required to be concealed from public view. If a raceway cannot be mounted internally behind the finished exterior wall, the exposed metal surfaces of the raceway should be finished to match the background wall, or integrated into the overall design of the sign. If raceways are necessary, they should be as thin and narrow as possible and should never extend in width or height beyond the area of the sign's lettering or graphics. All exposed conduit and junction boxes should also be concealed from public view. 
5.  Neon signs. Neon/L.E.D. or similar types of lighting are discouraged.

(2)  Notwithstanding section 12-3, non-conforming signs, the building official may require removal of signs that violate this subsection. To require immediate removal the building official must render a decision and give notice as provided by subsection 12-10. The owner or tenant must remove the sign or appeal the decision of the building official as provided by subsection 12-10.

DIVISION 6. SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS 
12-100  Measurement standards. 
(a)  Sign area measurement. 
(1)  For a wall sign, which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and dimensions, shall include the entire portion within such background or frame. 
(2)  For a wall sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area and dimensions of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the architecture of the building. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different elements. (See figure J below for walls signs, and figure K for freestanding signs.) 
Figure J: Example of geometric area applied to sign area calculations 

Figure K: Example of calculation for freestanding sign area 

(3)  For a vehicle sign the area and height of the sign does not include the vehicle, itself. 
(4)  For a freestanding sign, the sign area shall include the frame, if any, but shall not include: 
a.  A pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to constitute a display device, or a part of a display device. 
b.  Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of a freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and which may consist of landscaping, building or structural forms complementing the site in general. 
(5)  When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed as the measurement of one of the two faces. When the sign has more than two display surfaces, the area of the sign shall be the area of largest display surfaces that are visible from any single direction. The area of a sign with more than two faces would be calculated as the area of the largest rectangular plane of the panels that are visible from any single location. (See figure L below.) 
Figure L: Example of a sign area with multiple faces 

(6)  In the event of a dispute in determining the area or dimensions of any sign, the decision of the building official may be appealed by the applicant through the submittal of a formal application to the director of community development department in accordance with the variance process described in this chapter. 
(7)  Determining sign height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the ground, to the highest point of the sign. A freestanding sign on a manmade base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade of the nearest pavement or top of any pavement curb. 
(8)  Clearance for freestanding and projecting signs shall be measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign, including any framework or other embellishments. 
Figure M: Indicated method for measuring sign height from street level 

12-101  Construction standards. 
(a)  Design required. Before a sign permit shall be granted, the applicant shall submit to the building official a design or plan containing information as to the type, size, shape, location, construction, lighting/illumination, and materials of the proposed sign.

(4)  The signs should not be in locations that interfere with safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation or public safety signals and signs. 
(5)  No signs shall be erected, constructed or maintained so as to obstruct any fire escape, required exit, window, or door opening used as a means of egress. 
(6)  Signs shall be structurally designed in compliance with ANSI and ASCI standards. All elective signs shall be constructed according to the technical standards of a certified testing laboratory. 
12-102  Lighting standards. Signs may be illuminated-by external or internal means-and in addition to the requirements and regulations of the ordinance codified herein, provided that: 
(1)  The brightness and intensity shall not be greater than necessary to meet reasonable needs of the business or use served; 
(2)  Light sources shall be shielded from all adjacent buildings and streets; and 
(3)  The lighting shall not create excessive glare to pedestrians and/or motorists, and will not obstruct traffic control or any other public informational signs.

c.  The City Staff's technical report on the appeal; and

C.  Rough Proportionality and Fair Share Statement. 
1.  The City desires that a new development project contribute its fair and proportional share of such costs. 
2.  There is a direct correlation between the increased demand on public facilities that is created by a new development, and the City's requirements to dedicate right-of-way and Easements and to construct a fair and proportional share of public improvements that are necessary to offset such impacts such that new development does not negatively affect the City as a whole. 
3.  A fair and proportional share shall be determined as the level or standard of service that is required to adequately serve a new development. 
4.  Standards relating to the dedication or construction requirements shall be roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on the City's water, wastewater, storm drainage, parks or roadway system.

D.  Park Design Requirements for Neighborhood and Community Parks. Parks must be easy to access and open to public view to benefit area development, enhance the visual character of the City, protect public safety and minimize conflict with adjacent land uses. The following standards be used in designing parks and adjacent development: 
1.  Where physically feasible, parks shall be bounded by streets, or by other public uses (e.g. school, library, recreation center). 
2.  Where residential lots directly abut a park, lots must be oriented to side and not back to the park. In this instance, cul-de-sac and looped streets must be used to access the lots and park. 

3.  Residential lots may back to a park only when the site's physical character (e.g. shape, topography, drainage) does not reasonably permit an alternative design or the layout of the subdivision complements the use of the park (e.g., lots backing to a golf course). Lots backing to a park or open space shall only be allowed upon approval from the City Administrator and the Parks Department. 
4.  A proposed subdivision adjacent to a park may not be designed to restrict reasonable access to the park from other area subdivisions. Street connections to existing or future adjoining subdivisions may be required to provide reasonable access to parks. 
5.  Where a nonresidential use must directly abut a park, the use shall be oriented such that it sides, and does not back, onto the park if at all possible. The use must also be separated by a screening wall or fence and landscaping approved by the City. Access points to the park may be required by the City if a public benefit is established. 
6.  Alleys may abut a park provided that the alley does not exceed the residential lot depth by the width of the alley. Alleys should not be designed to encourage their use as a means of vehicular, bike or pedestrian travel to the park. 
7.  Streets abutting a park shall be built in accordance with the thoroughfare plan, the standards of this Ordinance and all other applicable construction standards and/or ordinances, as they exist or may be amended; however, the City may require any residential street built adjacent to a park to be constructed to collector street width to ensure access and prevent traffic congestion. 
a.  When park land is acquired, the City shall reserve sufficient land to provide the additional right-of-way required for an abutting collector size street, sixty (60) feet of right-of-way, unless otherwise approved by the City. 
b.  The proposed street alignment fronting on City parks is subject to City approval. Land owners shall also provide street access to all Major Creeks and/or Access Dedications. 
8.  If the City adopts a Recreation or Open Space Master Plan, all park land dedication shall meet the requirements stated therein. 
E.  Trail and Park Connections. 
1.  Public access to a park shall not be less than fifty (50) feet and shall not be part of a residential lot. The Property Owner shall install a ten (10) foot wide concrete trail from the street to the hike and bike trail/park prior to final acceptance of the subdivision. This trail must be blocked from motor vehicle traffic. However, the Property Owner may request to escrow funds for the contracted amount prior to final acceptance of the subdivision with City approval. The escrow amount will remain in place until the trail has been completed and accepted by the City. The requirements of this section 6.20.E.1 shall only apply if a Hike and Bike Plan is adopted by the City. 
2.  A twenty-five (25) foot level surface shall be provided for a twelve (12) foot wide public hike and bike trail when required. The twenty-five (25) foot wide level surface can be provided within and/or outside of the Base Flood Plain and/or Access Dedication. The parkway for the public street may count towards the twenty-five (25) foot wide level surface. The proposed hike and bike trail shall be shown on the Preliminary Plat. The Parks Department shall make the final determination of the placement of the public hike and bike trail at the time of the Final Plat. Low water crossings for the hike and bike trail may be permitted with approval from the City Administrator. The hike and bike trail shall be designed so as to minimize visibility blind spots from public streets for public safety purposes. No development shall interrupt future trail routes or otherwise hinder efficient public access to or from an existing or future planned trail. Gated and other limited access developments shall be designed such that they facilitate, and do not impede, through public access, emergency ingress and egress, usage and enjoyment of public trails 
3.  If the City adopts a Recreation or Open Space Master Plan, all park land dedication shall meet the requirements stated therein. 
F.  Dedication Requirements (Land, Payment, or Combination). 
1.  Land Conveyance or Payment in Lieu of Land. The owner of any property to be developed for residential purposes shall convey for park purposes land or make a payment of money in lieu of land, or a combination of both, to the City at the time of rezoning or subdivision to provide for the recreational needs created by such development, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Proposed Number of Dwelling Units. All plats, lots of record, replats, site plans or proposed improvements of land for new residential development shall indicate the number of proposed dwelling units to be constructed or placed within the development on such plat, lot of record, replat or site plan.
