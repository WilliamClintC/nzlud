PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Brownsville, Texas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through October 10, 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 
The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to James R. Goza, City Attorney, Sarah Reed, former City Secretary, Inelda T. Garcia, City Secretary, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Editor's note- The city's Home Rule Charter was adopted at an election held on December 13, 1915, and is set out herein as amended through June 28, 1963, for the convenience of the user of this Code of Ordinances. The original arrangement and article and section numbers have been retained. Where the same were omitted, the editor has provided article heading and section catchlines in brackets. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

ARTICLE I. - [INCORPORATION; BOUNDARIES] 

Section 1. - Incorporation and corporate name. 
    The inhabitants of the City of Brownsville, Texas, within the boundaries as now established or as hereafter established in the manner provided by law, shall continue to be a body politic and corporate, incorporated and known by the name and style of the "City of Brownsville", with such powers, rights and duties as are hereinafter provided, and all other powers and rights not specifically designated in this Charter that are granted by the Constitution and Laws of Texas to cities having more than five thousand (5,000) inhabitants. 
Section 2. - Boundaries. 
    The official boundaries and limits of the City of Brownsville shall be as are now established and hereinafter fixed from time to time by ordinance in accordance with provisions of this charter or by charter amendments, the official records of such boundaries and limits being retained in the office of the city secretary, the official map being maintained in the office of the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 871, Prop. No. 1, 7-29-1975) 
Editor's note- The official boundary of the city is on file in the city secretary's office. 
Section 3. - Extension of boundaries. 
    The boundaries and limits of the City of Brownsville, as now or hereafter existing, may be extended, so as to include within the corporate limits of said city any territory or several areas adjoining such limits as then existing by ordinance passed by the city commission, specifically defining the limits of the city after such inclusion, provided such ordinance shall be effective as an extension of the corporate limits only when it has been approved by a majority of the votes of the qualified voters residing within such limits, as extended, cast at a special election held for that purpose not less than thirty nor more than ninety days after the passage of such ordinance. 
    The ordinance shall fix and specify the date of the election, the boundaries of the voting precincts, the polling places in the several precincts and the form of the ballot (which shall be substantially as follows: "For the Ordinance Extending the City Limits" and "Against the Ordinance Extending the City Limits"), and shall name the presiding judges of the election. Notice of such election, issued by the mayor or by a majority of the city commission, shall be published once a week for at least three weeks before the day of the election in some newspaper published in said city. The election shall be held, returns thereof made, the returns canvassed and the result declared and recorded, in the same manner, and under the same laws, ordinances and rules as provided for general elections within said city. 
    Provided, however, that before enacting such ordinances the city commission shall hold a public hearing, after notice thereof, given by a publication once each week for three successive weeks prior to the date set for hearing, in some newspaper published at Brownsville, Texas, setting forth therein the territory or several areas proposed to be brought within the city limits (at which hearing the inhabitants of such territory or several areas, and the owners of property within the same may in person or by counsel offer evidence and present their views in favor of or against such inclusion, in addition to the presentation of evidence for or against the same on the part of the existing City of Brownsville and the inhabitants and taxpayers thereof), and shall find from the evidence submitted that the inclusion of such territory or several areas or some portion thereof, to be described in the findings and in the succeeding ordinance, is urban or suburban in character and adjacent to the city limits, and that the inclusion thereof within said limits would be a benefit to the inhabitants thereof and to the owners of property therein equal to or greater than the tax burden and other obligations that would fall upon them as the result of such inclusion, and that the inclusion of such territory or portion thereof would likewise be a benefit to the existing City of Brownsville. The findings made by the city commission after such notice and hearing shall be final and conclusive as to the facts so found, and shall be a sufficient and legal basis for the enactment of the ordinance above provided for. 
State Law reference- Annexation, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 43.001 et seq. 
Section 3a. - Extension of the city boundaries by a petition. 
    Whenever a majority of the property owners who are citizens of the state and inhabitants of any territory adjoining the City of Brownsville desire the annexation of such territory to said city, they may present a written petition to that effect to the city commission, describing the territory desired to be annexed and shall attach to said petition the affidavit of two or more of their number to the effect that said petition is signed by a majority of such qualified voters; and thereupon the city commission, at any regular session held not sooner than fifteen days after the presentation of said petition, and after giving ten days notice through a local paper of the presentation of said petition, and of a hearing on said petition, and after finding, that said petition has been signed by a majority of the resident property taxpayers of said territory desiring to be annexed, and that it is to the interest of the City of Brownsville that said territory should be annexed, may, by ordinance, annex such territory to the City of Brownsville, and thenceforth said territory shall be a part of the City of Brownsville, and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of other citizens and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions and regulations of said city. 
Section 3b. - [Extension by ordinance.] 
    The city commission shall have power by ordinance to fix the boundary limits of the City of Brownsville; and to provide for the alteration and the extension of said boundary limits and the annexation of additional territory lying adjoining to the city; provided that upon the introduction of any such ordinance in the city commission, it shall be published in the form it may be passed in a daily newspaper published in the City of Brownsville at least one (1) time, and said ordinance shall not be finally adopted until after the expiration of thirty (30) days from and after the date of the first publication thereof; and upon the final passage and adoption of such ordinance and when the boundaries of the City of Brownsville shall thereafter be fixed in such ordinance and when any additional territory has been so annexed, same shall be a part of the City of Brownsville for all intents and purposes, and the property situated therein shall bear its pro rata part of the taxes levied by the city and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of all the citizens and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions and regulations of the city. 
    Provided, however, that if within thirty (30) days from and after the first publication of said ordinance a petition requesting an election to determine whether said territory shall be annexed shall be filed with the city secretary of the said City of Brownsville, signed by at least 33 1/3 % of the aggregate number of voters qualified to vote in said city and in said territory sought to be annexed on the date of the filing of said petition, then and in that event the city commission shall, by ordinance within sixty (60) days after the filing of said petition, order and call an election to be held in said city for the purpose of determining whether a majority of the legally qualified voters residing within the territorial limits of said city and qualified to vote in said election favor the annexation of said territory proposed to be annexed, and shall at the same time order and call an election to be held at some convenient place within said city limits so that the legally qualified voters residing in the territory contiguous to said city and proposed to be annexed may appear and cast their votes for the purpose of determining whether a majority of the legally qualified voters residing in said territory proposed to be annexed and qualified to vote in said election favor the annexation of said territory proposed to be annexed. The city commission shall give notice of said elections by publishing same one (1) time in a newspaper published in the City of Brownsville, in which said notice the territory proposed to be annexed shall be described. Said elections shall be held in accordance with the provisions of the City Charter of the City of Brownsville concerning elections, except that the ballot shall read, in part, substantially as follows: "For the Ordinance Extending the City Limits" and "Against the Ordinance Extending the City Limits". If a majority of the qualified voters of the City of Brownsville qualified to vote at said election and voting at said election and a majority of the qualified voters residing within the territory proposed to be annexed qualified to vote at said election and voting at said election, each vote for said ordinance extending the city limits, the said ordinance shall then be finally passed by said city commission; otherwise not. In the event said elections do not approve said annexation no ordinance attempting to annex all or any part of said territory shall be introduced until after the expiration of one (1) year from and after said elections except by Charter amendment. 
    The word "newspaper" as used hereinabove means a newspaper as defined by the General Laws of the State of Texas. 
Section 4. - Platting of property. 
    Should any property lying within the city limits, as established by this Charter, be hereafter platted into blocks and lots, the owners of said property shall plat and lay the same off to conform to the streets and alleys abutting the same, and shall file with the mayor a correct map thereof; provided that in no case shall the City of Brownsville be required to pay for any of said streets or alleys, at whatever date opened, but when opened by reason of the platting of said property, at whatever date platted, they shall become, by such act, the property of the City of Brownsville for use as public highways, and shall be cared for as such. 
ARTICLE II. - [MISCELLANEOUS POWERS] 

Section 1. - Corporate powers. 
    The City of Brownsville, made a body politic and corporate by the legal adoption of this Charter and the amendments thereto, shall have perpetual succession; may use a corporate seal; may sue or be sued; implead or be impleaded in all courts and places, and in all matters whatsoever; may contract and be contracted with; may take, hold, purchase and acquire real estate or personal property within or without its boundaries, for any municipal purpose, governmental, proprietary or otherwise, in fee simple or lesser interest, title or estate, by purchase, gift, devise, lease or condemnation; and may sell, lease, hold, manage and control such property as its interests may require; and except as prohibited by the Constitution of Texas, or restricted by this Charter, shall exercise and enjoy all municipal powers, functions, rights, privileges, immunities and franchises of every name and nature, and be subject to all the duties and obligations now pertaining to or incumbent upon said city as a corporation.

The word highway as used herein shall include all streets, alleys, public places, avenues and squares in the city. The city shall have the power to assess not more than three-fourths of the cost of such work, except the cost of intersections and cost to be paid by owners of railroads and street railroads, against the owners of property abutting the highway or section thereof improved, and against said property, and to fix a lien against said property which shall be superior to all other liens and claims, except city, state and county and other taxes, and a charge of personal liability against owners of said property. The portion of the cost assessed against said owners of abutting property may be made payable in deferred installments, the last maturing of which shall become due not more than five (5) years from the completion of the improvements, and which shall bear interest at the rate of not exceeding eight (8) per cent per annum. Said assessments may include reasonable attorney's fees and cost of collection, if incurred, and the commission shall have the power to fix the terms of payment, maturity and conditions of said assessments and of the assignable certificates hereinafter provided for. 
    The entire cost of making such improvements between or under the rails, tracks and switches of railroads or street railroads, occupying any highway or intersection improved, and for two feet on the outside of said tracks, shall be paid by the owners thereof, and secured by a lien assessed on the roadbed, rails, ties, tracks, franchises and other property of said owners, which lien shall be superior to all other liens, claims or interests in or upon said property. The ordinance making such assessment shall provide the time and terms of payment thereof, and for the payment of interests, costs and attorney's fees as above set out. 
    No assessment shall be made against owners of abutting property or against railroads or street railroads, or their property, until after a hearing to said owners, and to lienholders or other interested parties, before the commission, preceded by reasonable notice thereof, which shall consist of a general notice published not less than ten days prior to the hearing in some newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Brownsville. The commission shall have authority to give other additional notice in its discretion, but the published notice shall be sufficient and binding upon lienholders and other interested parties and owners. 
    At said hearing, owners and other interested parties shall have the right to contest said assessments, the legality or regularity of any proceeding with reference thereto, or the special benefits arising from said improvements. 
    No assessment shall be made against any owner of abutting property or his property in excess of special benefits thereto in enhanced value thereof arising from said improvements. 
    All protests, contests and objections at said hearing shall be in writing, and the commission shall have power to hear evidence, summon witnesses and take testimony with reference thereto. 
    Said assessments may be enforced, either by suit in any court having jurisdiction, brought by the city for the benefit of the holder and owner of said assessments or the certificates evidencing same, or brought by said owner and holder, or by sale of the property assessed in the same manner or as near as possible, as is prescribed for sale of real estate for municipal taxes. 
    The lien of the assessments herein mentioned shall relate back and take effect as to all subsequent purchasers and creditors from the date of the ordinance or resolution ordering the improvement. 
    Subsection 1. The commission shall have power to cause to be issued in the name and on behalf of the city assignable certificates in writing, declaring the liability of the owners and their property for the payment of assessments and to fix the terms and conditions of such certificates. If any such certificate shall recite that the proceedings with reference to making such improvements have been regularly had in compliance with law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien against the property, and the personal liability of the owners, have been performed, such recitals shall be prima facie evidence of the facts so recited, and no further proof thereof shall be required in any court. 
    Subsection 2. Nothing herein contained shall empower the city to fix a lien by assessment against any property exempt by law from sale under execution, but the owner of such exempt property shall nevertheless be personally liable for the pro rata portion of said cost which would hereunder be assessed against such property were it not exempt, and such cost shall be assessed against said owner. 
    The fact that any improvement is omitted in front of exempt property shall not invalidate the lien of assessments made against other property. 
    Subsection 3. In apportioning costs of improvements among owners of the abutting property, the commission shall act in accordance with the front foot rule, in proportion as the front feet of property of each owner abutting the highway to be improved is to the whole frontage thereof. But if in particular cases the application of this rule would be unequal or unjust, the commission shall adopt such rule as shall effect substantial justice and equality, in view of special benefits received and burdens imposed. 
    Subsection 4. No error, mistake or informality in the ordinance of assessment or in any other step or proceeding prerequisite to said assessment shall invalidate the same, but the commission shall at any time correct the same. 
    No error or mistake in describing any parcel of abutting property or the name of its owner shall invalidate an assessment, but it shall notwithstanding have full force and be in effect against said premises and the real and true owner thereof. 
    Whenever in the opinion of the commission any error, mistake or invalidity exists in any proceeding with reference to said improvements or assessments, it shall correct said error, mistake or invalidity, and reassess said property and the owners thereof, with reference to which same exists. Such reassessments shall be made after a notice and hearing as herein provided, and not in excess of benefits in enhanced value of the property assessed, and otherwise as near as possible in accordance with the provisions hereof with reference to original assessments. After such reassessments the city shall have power to issue assignable certificates evidencing the same, as hereinbefore provided, which may be payable in deferred installments, the last maturing not over five years from date of said reassessment, and the terms and conditions of said certificates shall as near as possible comply with the preceding provisions hereof having reference thereto. 
    No reassessment shall be made unless proceedings therefor are begun within three (3) years from the date of the original assessments provided that if the validity of any assessments shall be involved in litigation, the period of time consumed therein shall not be considered in computing said three (3) years. 
    The commission shall have power to adopt rules, regulations and ordinances not inconsistent herewith for the purpose of carrying into effect every part of this section and its subsections and to effect said assessments and reassessments. 
    Subsection 5. Whenever the owners of more than fifty (50) per cent of the front feet of property abutting any highway or section thereof which they desire improved, shall petition the commission in writing (which may be one or more separate petitions) and shall state the limits within which the work is to be done, the general description thereof and the materials and methods or alternative materials and methods with which it is desired said improvements shall be made, and the signers of said petition shall agree therein to pay the several amounts which may be assessed against them respectively under the terms thereof, the said petition shall be filed with the commission, and shall be by it examined and in its discretion approved or disapproved by resolution. 
    The approval of such petition by the commission shall be conclusive of its regularity and validity, and if so approved, the commission shall order the work done as nearly as possible with the materials and in accordance with the methods, or if alternative materials or methods shall be set out in said petition, in accordance with some method and with some material or materials therein specified. 
    When procedure is under this subsection, the commission shall make said improvements and assess and apportion the cost thereof, after notice and hearing as hereinbefore provided, and shall take all steps and do all things with reference thereto in strict accordance with the provisions of this section. Provided that when said work is done pursuant to petition, the city shall pay the whole cost of improvement of intersections of other streets and alleys with the highways named to be improved, except the portion thereof assessed against railroads and street railroads so occupying said highway and intersections; said railroads and street railroads shall pay the whole cost of such improvement of said highway or portion thereof between and under their rails and tracks and two (2) feet on the outside thereof, which cost shall be assessed against the owners thereof and their property, and collected in the manner provided in this article; and the owners of property abutting the highway or section thereof to be improved shall pay the whole remaining cost of such improvements, and the same shall be apportioned among them and assessed against them and their property in the manner provided in this article. 
    Subsection 6. In any suit brought for the enforcement of an assessment, reassessment or personal liability, the allegation in the petition or other pleading that all proceedings with reference to making such improvements have been regularly had in compliance with the law, and that all prerequisites to the fixing of the assessment lien upon the property assessed and the personal liability of the owner, or the issuance of the assignable certificates, have been performed, shall be deemed a sufficient allegation of every proceeding required by law, the City Charter or its ordinance with reference to such improvement or prerequisites to the fixing of such lien or liability and issuance of said certificates, and shall dispense with the necessity of pleading each of said preceding steps or prerequisites specifically and shall in all courts be taken as if each of said steps, proceedings or prerequisites had been alleged and set out in full. 
    Any property owner against whom or whose property an assessment or reassessment has been made shall have the right within twenty days thereafter to bring suit in any court having jurisdiction to set aside or correct the same or any proceeding with reference thereto, on account of any error or invalidity therein. But thereafter such owner, his heirs, assigns or successors shall be barred from any such action or any defense of invalidity in such proceedings or assessments or reassessments in any action in which the same may be brought in question. 
    Subsection 7. All contracts for street improvements heretofore entered into by the city and not fully performed, and all proceedings had by it with reference thereto, are hereby ratified, confirmed and validated, and all powers heretofore enjoyed by the city whereby it was empowered to provide for the execution of said contracts, and for the assessment of any portion of the cost of said improvements against owners of property abutting same, and their said property, or against the owners of railroads and street railroads and their property, and also all powers of the said city for the enforcement of said assessments and collections thereof, are hereby extended and preserved in full force for the purpose of making said assessments and enforcing said existing contracts, and it shall be the duty of said commission to pass all ordinances and resolutions and take all steps necessary or proper to fully execute said contracts or validate or ratify the same and to make and enforce said assessments. 
    All the powers granted by this section and its subsections, when adopted, shall be applicable to the enforcement of said existing contracts, and to the making and enforcement of the assessments therein provided to be made against owners of abutting property, and their property, and against the owners of railroads and street railroads and their property, and to the issuance of assignable certificates as herein provided; and the commission shall fully exercise said powers to make and enforce said assessments, and to issue said certificates, under and in accordance with terms of this section and its subsections, when adopted.

Section 22. - [Article not preemptive.]

Section 30. - [Failure of officers no defense.] 
    Failure of the assessor and collector of taxes and the city attorney to do any of the things it is made their duty to do in this Charter as amended at any time, within the time specified therein, shall not be a defense to any suit for collection of taxes and establishment and foreclosure of any liens, nor shall such delay prohibit any other action taken for collection of said taxes.

No such Utility Improvement Revenue Bonds shall be issued until authorized at an election for such purpose called and held in the manner provided in Chapter I, Title 22, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended, for the issuance of bonds by cities. 
(c)  When Utility Improvement Revenue Bonds shall have been issued hereunder they shall constitute special obligations of the City of Brownsville and such bonds shall never be a debt of the city, but solely a charge upon the pledged revenues and shall never be reckoned in determining the power of the city to incur obligations payable from taxation. The bonds hereby authorized shall contain substantially the following provisions: 
"The holder hereof shall never have the right to demand payment of this obligation out of any funds raised or to be raised by taxation."

(4)  Cost of such extensions and repairs, as in the judgment of the city commission are necessary to keep the utility systems in operation and render adequate service to the city and its inhabitants or such as may be necessary to meet some physical accident or condition which would otherwise impair the efficient operation of the utility system.

(f)  Before any such Utility Improvement Revenue Bonds are sold they shall be submitted to and approved by the attorney general in the manner and with the effect provided in Articles 709 to 715, both inclusive, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, as amended and except as prescribed in this amendment said bonds shall be executed and issued in the manner provided by the Charter of the city.

Said Board is hereinafter referred to as the "Utilities Board", or, more simply, the "Board". Except as otherwise provided in this article, the Utilities Board shall have absolute and compete authority and power with reference to the control, management and operation of the power and light, water and sewage systems owned by the City of Brownsville, Texas, and the expenditure and application of the revenues of the systems, subject to the provisions contained herein, all of which shall be binding upon and shall govern the Utilities Board. 
b)  In connection with the management and operation of the various systems, and the expenditures and application of the revenues therefrom, the Utilities Board shall be vested with all of the powers of the City with respect thereto, except the fixing of rates, fees and charges for such services, except that no charge shall be made for any utilities furnished or used for City purposes and shall have full power and authority to make rules and regulations governing the furnishing of electricity, water and sewage service to customers, within and without the City, and for the payment of the same, and for the discontinuance of such service upon the failure of customers to pay therefore, and to the extent authorized by law shall have full power and authority with reference to the making of extensions, improvements and additions to the systems, and the acquiring, by purchase or otherwise, of properties of every kind in connection therewith, but the Board shall not have the power to encumber, sell or hypothecate the utilities system; provided that when deemed essential to the operation of the utilities system, the City Commission shall be authorized to enter into a contract for such period of time, with such renewal and extension privileges as may be prescribed therein, with any person, firm or corporation under the terms of which such supplier will make or hold available for delivery to and use by the system all or a part of the electrical power and energy to be used in or for the distribution system of the City. Such contract shall be payable solely out of the system revenues as an operating expense of the utilities system and rates and charges for services rendered by the system shall be fixed and maintained in an amount sufficient to pay all maintenance and operation expenses of the system and provide for the payment of principal and interest on any revenue bonds of the City payable from the revenues of the utilities system. No such contract shall be made when the sum contracted to paid annually is in such amount as will reduce "net revenues" of the system, as defined in Article VI, section 5(d) of this Charter, to a sum less than 150% of the aggregate average annual requirements for payment of principal and interest on all outstanding revenue bonds payable from the revenue of the utilities system, based upon such "net revenues" for the fiscal year next preceding the making of such contract. Notwithstanding any other provisions, no term of this Charter shall be construed as a waiver of governmental immunity and all privileges and immunities of the City of Brownsville as provided by the Texas State Constitution and other laws are expressly reserved for the Public Utilities Board without waiver. 
c)  Membership and Terms of Office. The Board shall be composed of seven members. The Mayor of the City of Brownsville shall ex officio be one of the voting members of the Board.

(b)  Funds under the control of the board shall be kept in the depository bank selected by it in accordance with the provisions of law relating to the selection of an official depository for the city. Board funds shall be paid out by said depository bank upon checks or vouchers signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board and countersigned by the secretary, secretary-treasurer, or such other person or persons as shall have been duly designated by the board in his stead. 
(c)  "Surplus funds" as used herein shall mean the money or income remaining in the plant fund at the close of each fiscal year after the requirements of section 6, article IV of the Charter have been met and after all payments have been fully and timely made into the several funds created by the ordinances authorizing revenue bonds at any time outstanding payable from and secured by a pledge of the net revenues of the utilities systems. Surplus funds in the plant fund at the close of each fiscal year, after retaining in the plant fund an amount deemed by the board to be sufficient to pay necessary operation and maintenance expenses of the systems for the next succeeding sixty days, shall be transferred as follows: 
(1)  To the general fund of the city the sum of $400,000, to the extent available, or an amount equal to 50% of the surplus funds, whichever is the greater, provided the payment of such minimum sum shall not be cumulative.

Appropriate adjustments shall be made at the close of each fiscal year to the end that the general fund of the city shall receive annually the amount of money herein provided to be paid into said fund, but only to the extent of the surplus funds available in such year for such purpose.

Third, retiring by calling or purchasing any such bonds prior to scheduled maturity dates; 
Fourth, to supplement debt service funds for bonds outstanding payable wholly or in part from the net revenues of the system; and

Sec. 1-13. - General penalty.

f.  All comments shall be made to the mayor and city commission as a whole, and not to individual commission members. 
(2)  Public comment.

a)  Individuals who wish to address city business and who have not spoken at the public comment section of a city meeting within the last 30 days will be selected in the order in which they register with the city secretary; 
b)  After those individuals who have not spoken at the public comment section of a city meeting within the last 30 days have been placed on the list as described above, the remaining individuals who wish to address city business but who have participated in public comment within the past 30 days will then be placed on the speaker list in the order in which they registered with the city secretary.

5.  Once acknowledged by the mayor, the person shall come to the designated microphone, and state his name and address, and engage in public comment. The mayor or city commission may allow the speaker to exceed the three-minute time limit if the information presented is of value to the discussion and does not unduly prolong the meeting.

3.  Speakers cannot be disruptive, abusive, profane, use "fighting words," or act in a disorderly manner. 
4.  Speakers may not engage in personal attacks which include the conduct of the person being attacked that is totally unrelated to the manner in which he or she performs their official duties. 
5.  If the mayor does not act promptly, any member of the city commission may require the mayor to immediately rule the speaker out of order if, after being recognized and making a motion that is seconded, a majority of the commission votes affirmatively to find the offending speaker to be out of order. 
d.  Should any person wish to address the city commission regarding a particular agenda item, he must wait until the appropriate agenda item is called and read by the city secretary. At this point, the mayor may acknowledge the request for commentary or question.

Sec. 10-1061. - Humane treatment. 
(a)  Generally. No owner shall fail to provide his animal with good wholesome food and water, proper shelter and protection from the weather (unusual extremes of cold and windstorm advisories), veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering, and humane care and treatment. Any owner of an animal shall maintain a clean and healthful shelter and living area for any animal being kept, which area shall be free of accumulated waste, debris, pests, fleas, and ticks so that the animal shall be free to walk or lie down without coming in contact with such waste, debris, or pests. All such shelters or living areas must be cleaned and maintained regularly so as to promote proper health for the animals being kept. 
(b)  Use of chain or restraint. If any animal is restrained by a chain, leash or similar restraint, it shall be designed and placed to prevent choking or strangulation. Such chain or restraint should not be directly attached to the animal's neck but instead attached to a properly fitted collar constructed of nylon, leather, or similar material specifically designed to be used for a dog. "Properly fitted" means the device is at least the circumference of the dog's neck plus one inch. Such chain or restraint shall be of an appropriated length but not be less than ten feet in length, appropriate in size and shall be either on a swivel designed to prevent the animal from choking itself or on a chain run.

Abandonment consists of leaving such animal for a period in excess of 24 hours without providing for someone to feed, water and check the animal's condition. No owner shall leave an animal by a roadside or other area or leave such animal on either public or private property without the property owner's consent. An animal so left shall be deemed abandoned. If an animal is found so abandoned, such animal may be taken by an animal control officer or police officer and impounded in the animal shelter or other facility maintained by a Humane Society and there confined in a humane manner. Such animal, if taken from private property, shall be kept for not less than 72 hours in accordance with the procedures set forth by the city animal regulation and care division and state laws.

Such animal shall be held as evidence and confined in such facility in a humane manner. Upon finding by a court that the animal has been neglected, beaten, cruelly ill-treated or tormented or involved in a dogfight, cockfight or other combat between animals, the animal shall become the property of the city. No person shall own, possess, keep or train any bird or animal, with the intent that such bird or animal shall be engaged in an exhibition of fighting.

    The building and standards commission shall hear evidence and shall, upon finding of the conditions and circumstances as set out in this section, declare a building or structure substandard and may order its repair, vacation or demolition as it may deem just, proper and appropriate, taking into consideration the circumstances and conditions found to exist. Such conditions and circumstances are as follows: 
(1)  Deteriorated building or structure. A building or structure which has become deteriorated and unsafe through natural causes or by damage as a result of exposure to the elements, to the extent that the roof, windows and doors or portions of the house, building or structure which protect from the elements thereby threaten the health, safety and well-being of the city's residents, citizens and inhabitants.

(3)  Pestilence. A building or structure which constitutes a menace to the health and safety of the city's residents, citizens and inhabitants because of the existence of conditions therein which are conducive to the harboring of rats or mice or other disease-carrying animals or insects reasonably calculated to spread disease. 
(4)  Structural deformities. A building or structure which has been built and constructed in such manner as to be hazardous in that the construction of the building or structure is of such a nature that it has placed the building or structure in jeopardy of collapse or that the building or structure will not reasonably withstand customary and ordinary exposure to the elements; a building or structure which, because of the deficiency of its materials, methods or means of construction, including the foundation, structural elements, wiring or apparatus, plumbing and fixtures, entrances or exits, renders the building or structure unsafe and dangerous. 
(5)  Inadequate fire safety. A building, structure or improvement which makes the structure hazardous because of the materials used; types of construction or design; warning devices; sprinklers or other fire suppression devices; availability of water supply for extinguishing fires; or location, design or width of the entrances or exits.

After the corrective operations the casing shall again be tested in the same manner. 
It is controllingly provided, however, that if a permittee can establish to the satisfaction of the city commission that the freshwater sands can be adequately protected by use of other means or measures, any or all of the requirements of this subsection may be waived by the city commission. 
(20)  Any and all sections of this article may be waived by the city commission upon a showing by the permittee to the satisfaction of the city commission that the planned manner of operation by the permittee or the equipment to be used by the permittee will adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare.

    The director of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service shall cause to be maintained in the offices of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission in looseleaf or other suitable form accurate, complete and up-to-date specifications for every class of positions in the classified service. These specifications shall include the following: 
(1)  The title of the class. 
(2)  A statement of the duties performed and the responsibilities exercised by each class of positions. 
(3)  Examples of tasks performed by employees holding positions within the class. 
(4)  The minimum and desirable qualifications required of an incumbent for the satisfactory performance of such duties and tasks and the exercise of such responsibilities. 
(Code 1971, § 11-63) 
Sec. 34-115. - Interpretation of specifications. 
    The specifications for the various classes of positions pursuant to this article are declared to have the following force and effect: 
(1)  The specifications are descriptive only and are not restrictive. They are intended to indicate the kinds of positions that should be allocated to the respective classes as determined by their duties, responsibilities and qualification requirements. The use of a particular expression or restriction as to duties, qualification requirements or other attributes shall not be held to exclude others not mentioned if such others are similar as to kind and quality. 
(2)  In determining the class to which any position shall be allocated, the specifications for each class shall be considered as a whole. Consideration is to be given to the general duties, the specific tasks, the responsibilities, the special and desirable qualifications and the relationships to other classes as affording a picture of the positions that the class is intended to include. 
(3)  Titles as far as possible are intended to be suggestive of the kind of work performed by the incumbent of the position and indicative of the rank. 
(4)  The duties statement shall be construed as a general description of the kinds of work performed by the incumbent of a position that is properly allocated to the class and not as describing or limiting what the duties of any position shall be. 
(5)  The examples of work shall be construed as typical tasks only, illustrative of the duties outlined by the general statement. These examples are not intended to be complete or exclusive, and the fact that the actual tasks performed by the incumbent of a position do not appear thereon shall not be taken to mean that the position is necessarily excluded from the class, provided that the tasks constituting the main work or employment are duly covered by the general statement of the duties. Any one example of a typical task taken without relation to the general statement of duties and all other parts of the specifications shall not be construed as determining whether a position should be allocated to the class. 
(6)  The statement of special and desirable qualifications constitutes a part of the description of the kind of employment by expressing the minimum and desired qualifications expected of any new appointee if he is to perform the work properly, and is to be so construed and not as imposing in itself any new or additional requirements for the filling of positions. Even though they may not be mentioned in the qualification statement, such qualifications as should be properly required in common of all incumbents of all positions, such as good physical health, freedom from defects, citizenship, honesty, sobriety, and industry, are to be considered as part of the qualification requirements. 
(Code 1971, § 11-64) 
Sec. 34-116. - Allocation of positions to classes. 
    The director of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service shall allocate each position in the classified service to its appropriate class in the classification plan. Such allocation shall be based on the duties and responsibilities of the present incumbents of such positions and shall be entered on the official roster cards maintained by the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission. The title of the class shall forthwith become the title of such individual positions and shall be used in payrolls submitted to the proper disbursing officer, and in requests to the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission for the certification of eligibles, in reports made to the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission as provided by the rules and regulations of such commission and in any other official records and communication of such commission and of all budget and financial officers. 
(Code 1971, § 11-65) 
Sec. 34-117. - Reallocation of positions when duties change. 
    Whenever a new position should be established or the duties of an existing position are so changed that in effect the old position as described in the class specifications for the class to which it was originally allocated no longer exists and in its place there is created a position which should be allocated to a different class, the director of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service, in consultation with the department heads, shall report this fact to the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission and send in on the commission's prescribed form a full statement of the circumstances and a description of the duties as changed or as set up. Upon the recommendation of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission, after a full investigation of the actual and proposed duties, responsibilities and qualification requirements, the city commission may allocate or reallocate the position to its appropriate class in accordance with the classification plan then in effect. If necessary, a new class shall be established to provide for the new position. The firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission shall likewise from time to time of its own motion make investigations of any or all positions in the classified service and shall, in accordance with this article, make recommendations to the city commission for the allocation of positions whenever the facts are such as to warrant such action. 
(Code 1971, § 11-66) 
Sec. 34-118. - Hearing on appeals from allocation. 
    If an employee believes that his position has been improperly allocated as provided in this article, he may protest by presenting his reason therefor upon such forms or documents as the director of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service may prescribe; the claim shall be investigated by the director and the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission, then referred to the city commission for its decision which shall be final. 
(Code 1971, § 11-67) 
Sec. 34-119. - Status of employees at time law adopted. 
    If, pursuant to this article, a position at any time is reallocated to a different class to correct an error in the original allocation, the incumbent shall continue in the position without tests or other proofs of fitness. If a position is reallocated to another class on account of changed duties and responsibilities, the incumbent may, upon written recommendation of the department head, the passing of a noncompetitive examination given by the director of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service, and approval of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission, continue in the position. This shall not pertain if an employee is actually transferred to another position involving substantially different or higher qualifications, but only when new duties and responsibilities have been added or absorbed by the incumbent in addition to his regularly assigned work. 
(Code 1971, § 11-68) 
Sec. 34-120. - Periodic investigations. 
    The director of the firefighters' and police officers' civil service shall, at least once every two years, investigate and report to the firefighters' and police officers' civil service commission and to the city commission upon the appropriateness of the class titles assigned to each position in the classified service. Such investigation, either by the director or by any member of the commission so designated, shall further determine whether any employees in one class are performing duties regularly assigned to positions in another unrelated class. 
(Code 1971, § 11-69) 
Sec. 34-121. - Class specifications. 
    The classes of positions in the police and fire departments in the classified service and the specifications for such classes shall be as determined by the city commission from time to time and on file in the office of the city secretary.

b.  Obedience and commitment beyond the law; 
c.  Commitment to the public good; 
d.  Respect for the value and dignity of all individuals; 
e.  Accountability to the public; 
f.  Truthfulness; 
g.  Fairness; and 
h.  Responsible application of resources. 
(2)  In keeping with the values set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section and to assist in the fulfillment of responsibilities to the individuals and communities served, each elected or appointed official should subscribe to the principles herein and: 
a.  Operate with integrity and in a manner that merits the trust and support of the public; 
b.  Uphold all applicable laws and regulations, going beyond the letter of the law to protect and enhance the city's ability to accomplish its mission;

g.  Strive for personal and professional growth to improve effectiveness as an elected or appointed official. 
(c)  Applicability. To implement the policy and principles set forth in this section, the city commission has determined that it is advisable to enact this code of ethics for all city officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, advisory or administrative, to serve not only as a guide for official conduct of the city's public servants, but also as a basis for discipline for those who refuse to abide by its terms.

    Alarm company means any person engaged in the activity of selling, leasing, renting, installing, inspecting, maintaining, repairing, monitoring and/or responding to alarm systems within the city. An alarm company, in this instance, does not include any business which sells on a retail basis from a fixed location or that manufactures or distributes alarm equipment at wholesale, unless such business also installs, services, monitors and/or responds to alarm systems within the city. 
    Alarm notification means a notification intended to summon the police, which is designated either to be initiated purposely by a person or by an alarm system that responds to a stimulus characteristic of unauthorized intrusion.

(2)  An alarm system may be classified as follows: 
a.  Class A system, upon activation, provides for signaling to an alarm monitoring facility owned, operated or utilized by an alarm company, regardless of its location, a common example of which would be an alarm in a business activated by the pushing of a button which alerts an alarm company that an alarm has been activated, and the alarm company in turn alerts the police department of that fact. Another example would be an alarm system which is activated upon the exiting of a residence or business, which protects such by having an alarm alert sent to an alarm company, in case of an illegal entry, who in turn alerts the police department to that fact. 
b.  Class B system, upon activation, causes an external signaling device of any type to be seen or heard from beyond ten feet of the protected premise, or any other type of alarm system which upon activation has as its purpose the direct summoning of police response that is not monitored by an alarm company. 
c.  Class C system, upon activation, provides for direct signaling to a console or other receiving equipment located for such purposes at any emergency department of the city, including but not limited to any hospital or financial institution which has a direct signal alerting a city console of fire or criminal activity. 
    Chief means the chief of police or his authorized representative. 
    Criminal offense means a criminal offense as contemplated in V.T.C.A., Penal Code. 
    False alarm notification means an alarm notification responded to by the police department, when the responding officer finds no evidence of unauthorized intrusion, attempted unauthorized intrusion, robbery, attempted robbery, or an attempt to take a person hostage, unless the false alarm notification is caused by a power outage or act of God which is beyond the control of the permit holder and such condition can be verified by the permit holder as provided in the definition of the term "act of God" in this section. 
    Permit holder means the person designated in the permit application who shall be the owner or lawful tenant of the alarm site or his authorized representative.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 46-77. - Unreasonable noise prohibited.

(b)  The provisions of this section do not apply to the sounds generated by authorized emergency vehicles; to vehicle horns sounded as a danger warning signal; to sound made on property belonging to or leased or managed by a federal, state, or county governmental body other than the city and made by an activity of the governmental body; to audible alarm police alarm devices operated in conformity with local and state law. 
(Code 1971, § 22-1; Ord. No. 2010-1526, § 2, 8-3-2010) 
Sec. 46-78. - Enumeration of excessive sound levels. 
(a)  No person shall: 
(1)  Operate any type of vehicle, machine, or device; 
(2)  Carry on any activity; or 
(3)  Promote or facilitate the carrying on of any activity which makes sound in excess of the levels specified in this section. 
(b)  Sound from a moving vehicular source located within the public right-of-way shall not exceed 80 decibels on the "A" weighting scale (dB(A)), except that sound from a vehicle with a manufacturer's gross weight rating of 10,000 pounds and above operated on a prescribed truck route at all times or elsewhere within the city during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Monday through Saturday may exceed eight dB(A) but shall not exceed 88 dB(A). Such sound shall be measured at a distance of at least 25 feet from a vehicle located within the public right-of-way. 
(c)  Sound from any source, other than a moving vehicular source located within the public right-of-way, shall not exceed any of the following limits for its appropriate zone: 
(1)  The zone limits prescribed by this section are set forth in the following table: 
Zoning Designation of the Property (source) on Which the Sound is Received Maximum Number of Decibels Permitted from 8:00 a.m. until 12:00 a.m. Maximum Number of Decibels Permitted from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. D, DR, A 63 dB(A) 50 dB(A) 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C 70 dB(A) 60 dB(A) 7C, 8C, 9C 72 dB(A) 72 dB(A)

(3)  No person shall make any trash pickup with a truck [that] has a compactor or the capacity to raise and dump dumpsters in any area zoned for residential or business uses between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., and no employer shall fail to prevent its employee from violating this subsection while the employee is driving a trash truck owned by or under the control of the employer. For the purposes of this subsection, testimony that the name of a business which holds itself out as being in the business of trash hauling was written on the trash truck shall be prima facie evidence that the trash was owned by or was under the control of the employer so identified. 
Trash haulers may apply to the city manager for variance of the provisions of subsection (3) above for business district locations. Possession of a valid variance shall be a specific defense to any change under subsection (3) above if the act complied of was within the variance granted. The manager may grant all or a part of any requested variance, and may place such conditions upon any variance granted as are reasonably suited to limit the harmful effects of the variance. Such variances shall be granted only if the applicant can demonstrate to the manager's satisfaction: 
a.  That the location in question is sufficiently removed from any residential use that the noise of trash removal will not disturb anyone in their residence, including, without limitation, hotel and motel accommodations; or 
b.  That the location cannot feasibly be serviced during permitted hours, and that the variance is the least necessary to permit trash removal while still assuring nearby residents reasonable nocturnal quiet. 
(4)  For all complaints regarding sounds from a source regulated by this subsection: 
a.  The compliance of sounds shall be ascertained by measuring the decibel level of said sounds (utilizing the dB(A) scale) from the sound source and within the property lines on which the sound source is located. 
i.  If, after measurement as described in subsection a. above, the sound decibel level falls within the guidelines as indicated by the chart in subsection (c)(1), said sound shall be deemed in compliance with this chapter. 
ii.  If, after measurement as described in subsection a. above, the sound decibel level falls higher than the guidelines as indicated by the chart in subsection (c)(1), said sound shall then be measured from the property line of the complaining property. If the sound decibel level then falls within the guidelines as indicated by the chart in subsection (c)(1), said sound shall be deemed in compliance with this chapter. If the sound decibel level falls higher than the guidelines as indicated by the chart in subsection (c)(1), said sound shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
b.  For the purposes of this paragraph, a leasehold shall be deemed a property, and its boundary shall be deemed a property line. 
(d)  All sound measurements shall be made on a sound level that meets ANSI specification SI.4-1974 for Type I or Type II equipment. The manufacturer's published indication of compliance with such specifications is prima facie evidence of compliance with this subsection. 
(e)  It is a specific defense to a charge of violating this section that: 
(1)  The sound was made by an authorized emergency vehicle when responding to an emergency call or acting in time of emergency; 
(2)  The sound was made within the terms of a parade, fireworks display, or temporary street closure permit issued by the city manager, or was made by rendering of military honors at a funeral by a military funeral honors detail; 
(3)  The sound was made by an animal; 
(4)  The sound was made by the sounding of the horn of any vehicle as a danger warning signal or by the sounding of any warning device required by law; 
(5)  The sound was made on property belonging to or leased or managed by a federal, state or county governmental body other than the city and was made by an activity of the governmental body or by others pursuant to a contract, lease, or permit granted by such governmental body; or 
(6)  The sound was made within the terms and conditions of a sound level variance granted by the city manager or the manager's authorized representative. A variance shall be granted after application is made if the manager finds that compliance will cause an undue hardship and further finds that: 
a.  Additional time is necessary for the applicant to alter or modify the activity or operation to comply with this section; or 
b.  The activity, operation or sound source will be of temporary duration, and even with the application of the best available control technology cannot be done in a manner that would comply with this section. In either case, the manager must also find that no reasonable alternative is available to the applicant. If the manager grants a variance, the manager shall prescribe such reasonable conditions or requirements as are necessary to minimize adverse effects upon the community or the surrounding neighborhood. 
(f)  This section shall not be construed to conflict with the right of any person to maintain an action in equity to abate a noise nuisance under the laws of the state. 
(g)  Each offense of violation of this section constitutes a separate and distinct violation.

ARTICLE II. - AD VALOREM TAXES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 94-26. - Collection. 
(a)  It shall be the declared policy of this tax unit that the expenses of maintaining records on delinquent ad valorem taxes owed to the city and of collecting such taxes, an unfair burden on the general revenue and the taxpayers who pay on time, should be borne instead by the delinquent properties and their owners who are responsible for causing such expenses. To effectuate this policy, the city orders that such costs be charged against the delinquent properties and their owners as authorized collection expenses as provided in this section, and the costs are made a part of the tax liens against the delinquent property to which each such cost is attributable. 
(b)  Whenever any delinquent ad valorem taxes owed to this tax unit are collected, by suit or otherwise, the city's tax assessor-collector shall charge $1.00 for each receipt issued for such tax payments, this charge to be an authorized collection expense and collected at the time of payment of the delinquent taxes. 
(c)  Whenever any accounts for delinquent ad valorem taxes owed to this tax unit are placed in the hands of its tax attorney for collection, the city's tax assessor-collector shall furnish all affidavits, certified copies of records of the city's tax office and such other evidence as may be in his possession by virtue of such office and which are requested by the city's tax attorney, and the assessor-collector shall collect a cost or charge of $1.00 for each affidavit, each certified copy of records and any other item of evidence furnished upon request, this cost to be an authorized collection expense which shall be collected at the time of payment of the delinquent taxes, before or after suit. 
(d)  Whenever certified copies of records of governmental agencies are needed for preparing, filing and/or prosecuting suits and claims for delinquent ad valorem taxes and these are obtained by or for the city's tax attorney, the actual costs charged for such certified copies by the governmental agencies furnishing them shall be authorized collection expenses and shall be collected at the time of payment of the delinquent taxes, before or after suit. 
(e)  The city's designated tax attorney, whether a salaried lawyer employed by the city or an attorney retained under a delinquent tax collection contract, shall assist, by suit or otherwise, in the collection of delinquent ad valorem taxes owed to the city. To recover its costs of such legal services, the city shall be entitled to and shall collect an authorized collection expense of 15 percent of the delinquent taxes and penalty, including any interest owed, due at the time of collection, before or after suit and/or foreclosure sale. 
(f)  If any subsection of this section or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable. It is further specifically provided that if any of the authorized collection expenses provided for in this section ever should be determined upon final adjudication to be in excess of the amount allowed by any applicable law, any such authorized collection expense nevertheless shall be valid and collectible for the maximum amount allowed by law, the same as if such maximum amount had been specifically ordained in this section in words and figures. 
(g)  If it ever should be determined by a final adjudication that this action should have been in some form other than an ordinance, this section shall be considered to have been passed, approved and adopted by the governing body of this tax unit as a resolution or an order or in whatever form is legally necessary under V.T.C.A., Tax Code § 302.102 or any other applicable statute to impose the charges specified in this section.

(b)  All taxable heritage sites other than secondary local sites or potential sites are designated as historically significant sites in need of tax relief to encourage their preservation; provided, however, that: 
(1)  Such designation shall expire for any site which ceases to be a taxable heritage site or which becomes a secondary local site; and 
(2)  Such designation shall not apply to those sites which contain no historic structure, as indicated in the heritage plan pursuant to section 348-1504; and 
(3)  No new federal site or state site shall be eligible for historic tax relief if the addition of such site would likely cause the total potential annual revenue foregone by the city on federal sites and state sites to exceed one-half of one percent of the city's total potential annual ad valorem tax revenues. 
(c)  All federal and state sites benefited by subsection (b) of this section are exempted from all ad valorem taxation by the city, except those federal and state sites that are separately deleted (blocked) from participation in the ad valorem tax exemption component of the heritage plan because of deterioration of the heritage site as determined pursuant to section 348-1502(c). Those sites shall not be exempted from ad valorem taxation by the city or other local taxing units. 
(d)  Each primary local site benefited by subsection (b) of this section is granted a historical ad valorem tax exemption equal to 50 percent of the gross assessed value of such site, except those primary local sites that are separately deleted (blocked) from participation in the ad valorem tax exemption component of the heritage plan because of deterioration of the heritage site as determined pursuant to section 348-1502(c). Those sites shall not be exempted from ad valorem taxation by the city or other local taxing units. 
(e)  In addition each primary local site benefited by subsection (b) of this section, on which there is successful completion of substantial new rehabilitation in accordance with [the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as referenced in] section 348-1490, is totally exempted from ad valorem taxation for five years. 
(f)  If a site which has directly benefited from an exemption granted by subsection (c), (d) or (e) of this section loses its official historic designation due to inappropriate physical changes such as site demolition, other than those changes caused by an act of God, an additional tax is imposed on the site equal to the difference, if any, between the taxes imposed on the site for each of the five years preceding the year in which such historic designation is lost and the taxes that would have been imposed had the site not been subject to the net lost historical exemption in each of those years, plus interest at an annual rate of seven percent calculated from the dates on which the differences would have become due. 
(g)  This section shall be administered in a manner consistent with V.T.C.A., Tax Code §§ 11.24, 11.41, 11.42, 11.43, 11.44, 11.45, and 11.46.

(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.3), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-229. - Failure to comply with citation; penalties and mailings. 
(a)  If, for the third time within any six-month period, a violator of the restrictions on stopping, standing or parking at a metered space under the terms of this subdivision has not appeared in response to three notices affixed to such vehicle within the required period of ten days each, the director of traffic, as designee of the municipal court clerk, shall at any time thereafter send to the registered owner (the presumed driver) of the motor vehicle to which the third citation was affixed the first and only mailed notice to inform him of this third violation within a six-month period and the requirement for the violator to pay the fines or fees at the department of traffic. The notice shall include a notice to the violator that failure to do so within ten days thereafter causes the director of traffic to have these three violations to be presented to a municipal court judge at a hearing (noting the date certain at which time the hearing will be held) at which time director of traffic shall ask the court to declare the vehicle a nuisance. When so declared as a nuisance the vehicle will become subject to booting and shall be booted instanter without further notice if found. This notice shall be in English and Spanish. 
(b)  Procedures for penalties and mailings are as follow: 
(1)  Specifically section 98-198 pertaining to the fee for overparking in metered spaces is repealed, and each fee for overparking in a metered space or stall with the meter indicating no time left shall be $5.00; if unpaid after ten days the fee shall be $10.00. 
(2)  In addition to each fee of $10.00, there is assessed one mailing penalty for not paying two or more overparking fees within each prescribed 20-day period. This penalty shall be $35.00, and this shall be the total owed only if the violator presents himself at the department of traffic before any municipal court hearing to declare the vehicle a nuisance. 
(3)  Upon a presentation by the department of traffic to the municipal court judge to declare a vehicle a nuisance, the judge may require an additional court cost up to $100.00 upon the appearance of the violator. If there is no appearance, there may be an additional mailing fee of $25.00 but only if the judge orders a second mailing by registered mail, return receipt requested. 
(4)  Once the vehicle has been declared a nuisance and is booted and/or impounded, the judge shall also have the discretion to assess additional fines up to $50.00 each on those unpaid parking citations in excess of the first three. 
(5)  The data processing department shall send out no more than one regular mailing concerning any one vehicle with the same license plate, as long as the license plate continues to be traced back to the same registered owner. The traffic department shall send out no more than one registered letter, return receipt requested, concerning any one vehicle with the same license plate, and then only if so ordered by a judge which has declared such vehicle a nuisance. 
(6)  Such immobilization by booting shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by this Code, and a fee up to $50.00 for such may be set by the judge for the booting alone, irrespective of other fees. 
(7)  It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to tamper with or try to force the device (boot) from the wheel of a vehicle, to remove the booted wheel from a vehicle, to move the booted vehicle, or to disable or damage the booting device. 
(8)  No additional fees may be imposed by the judge if actual impoundment of the vehicle is required except the actual costs of impoundment and storage.

Sec. 98-230. - Nuisance. 
    A vehicle that has received three or more citations, unresolved, pursuant to this subdivision within any six-month period is declared a nuisance. An unresolved parking citation occurs when a citation is issued under section 98-228 and the driver does not respond within ten days as required in such section. 
(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.5), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-231. - Procedure for impoundment or booting of vehicles declared nuisance. 
(a)  After ascertaining that a vehicle has three or more citations unresolved pursuant to this subdivision, within any six-month period, the director of traffic, after the requisite notice required by this subdivision, shall appear before the municipal court for authorization to impound or immobilize by booting such vehicle, it being declared a nuisance. 
(b)  At that time, if evidence shall be presented as to the number of unresolved parking citations and that all notice requirements have been met, the judge may declare the vehicle a nuisance solely on the basis of this evidence and that the vehicle shall be immobilized by booting or impoundment instanter, if such vehicle is found to be standing or parked unlawfully or in or upon any regularly designated parking metered space. In addition the judge has the discretion to order, when possible or practical, such as if a license plate check in the United States can identify the driver and his address, the person appearing to attempt to notify the driver by mailing a certified notice, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the driver as shown by the license plate check, informing such driver/owner that the vehicle has been declared a nuisance and has been ordered by the court to be immobilized instanter by booting or impoundment, if the vehicle is found to be standing or parked unlawfully or in or upon any regularly designated parking metered space. The mailing, if ordered, and the failure to receive this letter is in no way a prerequisite to any vehicle being impounded or booted; however, the judge may also order the traffic department to withhold enforcing its order for a period not to exceed ten days after the date mailed. If the vehicle is immobilized by impoundment or booting, it shall remain at or be taken to a place of immobilization and there kept until application for its redemption shall be made by the owner or his duly authorized agent. 
(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.6), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-232. - Right to redeem immobilized vehicle. 
    When a vehicle is to be immobilized under this subdivision, appendix A attached to Ordinance No. 92-1256 includes a sample of a procedure that may be used as a guideline for the department of traffic to adopt as its procedures. Nothing in the sample shall prohibit the traffic department from adopting a different or similar procedure, with the concurrence of other city departments that are involved, and finally approved by the judge. Until another is adopted, the sample shall constitute the temporary procedure until a different one is adopted. Readoption of a new procedure under this section shall not require an amendment of this section as the sample is strictly advisory. 
(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.7), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-233. - Right to redeem impounded vehicle. 
    When a vehicle is impounded under section 98-162, at any time prior to its sale as an abandoned vehicle, the owner or his duly authorized agent shall be entitled to the possession thereof upon the payment of all the costs of removal and storage that may have accrued thereon, plus any fines or costs owed to the city for parking violations, unless the owner/driver posts a bond under the requirements of section 98-236. If the owner or authorized agent posts a bond, the vehicle shall be released. 
(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.8), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-234. - Notice of violation. 
    After the vehicle has been impounded under section 98-231 and if no owner or driver appears, a notice shall be prepared and sent certified mail by the municipal court to the owner within 48 hours of the impounding of the vehicle, if the address can be ascertained as shown by a United States license number check. If the automobile license check is that of a foreign country, the notice shall be published twice within a 30 day period in the Brownsville Herald. The notice shall specify the procedures for redeeming an impounded vehicle, including the name, address and telephone number of the person to be contacted; the bonding procedure; and the right to a hearing. If no owner/driver comes forward to claim the vehicle after all the notices required by this subdivision, the vehicle shall be treated as an abandoned vehicle. 
(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.9), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-235. - Hearing on impounded immobilized vehicle. 
    After the impounding/immobilization of a vehicle, the owner/driver shall have the right to a hearing before a municipal court judge to contest the circumstances surrounding the impounding/immobilization of the vehicle or to present any other defense he might have to the actions taken. An expedited hearing shall be held within 48 hours of the impounding or immobilization or the next municipal court working day after the impounding, whichever is the greater time, if the owner requests such an expedited hearing in writing and if there is an agreement between the owner/driver and the city attorney on evidentiary procedures. 
(Ord. No. 92-1256, § 1(32-264a.10), 6-9-1992) 
Sec. 98-236. - Bond for impounded vehicle. 
    The owner or driver of a vehicle which is impounded pursuant to this subdivision may secure release of the vehicle pending the hearing by making an appearance on the unresolved citations and posting a bond in the amount of the fines, court costs, administrative fees, towing fees and storage fees owed. If the municipal court is closed so that the owner or driver cannot make an appearance, the owner/driver may post the bond and obtain release of the vehicle without an appearance. If the owner/driver cannot afford the bond for his vehicle, he shall be allowed a hearing within 24 hours of his request for a hearing or the next municipal court working day after his request, whichever is the greater time, if there is an agreement between the owner/violator and the city attorney on evidentiary procedures. At this hearing, if the owner/driver is found not guilty of the traffic offenses or the court otherwise finds that the vehicle should not be impounded, the court shall order the vehicle released without the payment of any costs or fees. If the owner/driver posts a bond and fails to appear timely at any hearing scheduled to contest the impounding of the vehicle or the underlying traffic violation, the bond shall be forfeited and all fines deemed paid.

(b)  Availability. This rider is available to a customer qualified for service under the public utilities board's general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates with 500 or more kilowatts demand and as more fully set forth in this section. This rider is available only when, in the sole opinion of public utilities board, there is sufficient system capacity and fuel to serve the requirements of its other customers and to maintain its spinning reserve. This rate is not applicable to customers who are not full requirements customers of the public utilities board or for temporary service for construction power This rider is not applicable to relocations or transfers of load within the public utilities board service territory. This rider is not applicable for loads under an existing contract or for facilities under construction prior to the original effective date of this rider (December 18, 1996). 
(c)  Applicability. This rider applies to a new customer or the additional load of an existing customer who is or may be, in the opinion of public utilities board, qualified for service under the general service demand (GS-D), or general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates and who meets the following criteria: 
(1)  The customer makes application for the rider which includes a notarized affidavit from an officer of the customer confirming that this rider was an important contributing factor in the customer's decision to add new or additional load. 
(2)  The new or additional load creates at least ten new jobs. 
(3)  The added monthly electrical demand of the customer is or is estimated to be at least 200 kilowatts. 
(4)  Application for service under this rider shall be accompanied by sufficiently detailed information to enable the public utilities board to determine whether the new customer or additional load meets the criteria in subsections (c) (1) through (3) of this section. This rider shall become effective upon board approval. Service under this rider is subject to a contract between the customer and public utilities board containing such terms and conditions as may be required by the public utilities board. 
(5)  The additional energy use is or is expected to be at least 20 percent greater than the base period energy. 
(6)  Complete electric power requirements. The customer agrees that public utilities board shall be the sole source of electricity used at the facility and agrees to purchase, during the term of the agreement, all of its electric power requirements from the public utilities board. 
(d)  Incentives. Incentives are as follows: 
(1)  Rate discounts. The economic development rider (EDR) provides a five-year discounted rate on energy based on the marginal cost of energy on new or expanded energy or customers under the public utilities board's general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates with loads of 500 kilowatts or more. For new customers, the incremental energy is the entire kilowatts per hour. For existing customers incremental energy is energy in excess of the base period kilowatts per hour. The base period is the 12-month period immediately preceding the month that service is provided under this rider or a period mutually agreed upon by the customer and public utilities board. 
Energy billed under the provisions of this rider shall be determined by subtracting from the then-current monthly usage the base period energy use divided by 12. All incremental energy for this rider is billed as follows: 
First year, per kWh ..... $0.001 
Second year, per kWh ..... 0.002 
Third year, per kWh ..... 0.003 
Fourth year, per kWh ..... 0.004 
Fifth year, per kWh ..... 0.005 
If at any time the public utilities board determines that its marginal average cost of energy for any customer or any new load exceeds the rates charged under this rider, it may, upon six months' notice, adjust the rates for that customer or new load to exceed the marginal average cost. If the scheduled rates as shown in this subsection exceed the then-billed rate for such energy, the lower value shall apply. The economic development rider provides a five-year discounted rate on energy. After the fifth contract year, this incentive provision shall cease. Demand charges will remain as provided under the public utilities board's general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates. 
For existing customers with qualifying additional load, monthly energy charges during the five-year period of discounted energy rates for the base period kilowatts per hour will be a fixed amount based on the average base period kilowatts per hour energy use and average monthly base period kilowatt billing demand under the otherwise applicable rate. Average monthly base period kilowatt billing demand will be the sum of the base period kilowatt billing demand divided by 12. 
(2)  Local service facilities. The public utilities board will not require a contribution in aid of construction for standard facilities installed to serve the customer if the expected revenues from the new load are, in the opinion of public utilities board, sufficient to justify the required investment in the facilities. A contract for a minimum term of electric service to be taken from the public utilities board may be required. 
(e)  Fuel and purchased energy charge. There shall be added to the base rate of every electric rate schedule the currently effective fuel and purchased energy charge subject to section 102-193. 
(f)  Term. The public utilities board may freeze the availability of this rider with respect to new loads at any time following the first anniversary of the initial offering of this rider. Any customer receiving service under this rider on the date it is frozen may continue to receive the benefits of the incentive provisions in this section through the remaining term of such customer's contract.

(Ord. No. 96-983-P, § 17(34-115), 12-18-1996) 
Sec. 102-214. - Experimental load aggregation rider (ELAR). 
(a)  Definition. The experimental load aggregation rider (ELAR) is designed to accommodate customers who are billed under the general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates and who have requested aggregation of electric service billing. Aggregate billing involves a customer with multiple metering points at more than one location. The demand (kilowatts) and energy (kilowatts per hour) for each service point are metered separately and totaled for all locations on a coincident basis. The billing kilowatts will be the maximum 15-minute measured coincident demand for all locations. The billing kilowatts per hour will be the sum of kilowatts per hour metered at each location. Aggregate billing applies only to the billing kilowatts and kilowatts per hour and the resulting charges. It does not apply to customer charges which are imposed at each meter location. Under this method, the customer pays a customer charge applicable for each location, as opposed to the multiple customer charges paid under summary billing. By aggregating demands, the customer's demand billing units will likely result in a lower total demand reflecting the diversity between the several metered locations and, therefore, a lower demand charge will result. 
(b)  Metering. Application of the aggregation to billing procedures will require certain particular metering facilities that allow for the required collection of time-differentiated billing data. The public utilities board may require load profile information. The customer is responsible for phone lines for the meters. 
(c)  Applicability. This experimental bill aggregation rider may be offered to customers at the general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates and who have requested aggregation of their billings. 
(d)  Aggregated bills. Requirements, measurements and billing for aggregated bills are as follow: 
(1)  Requirements. Requirements are as follow: 
a.  Single, common ownership. 
b.  Must have coincident demand metering. 
c.  May aggregate bills only within rate classes. 
d.  Have combined monthly demands of 600 kilowatts or more for the previous 12 months or can demonstrate that future loads will be 600 kilowatts or more per month. 
e.  Service requested must include all of the customer's facilities in the certificated service area of the public utilities board. 
(2)  Measurements. Measurements are as follow: 
a.  Aggregated kilowatts per hour equals the summation of individually metered kilowatts per hour. 
b.  Aggregated kilowatts equals the maximum coincident demand for the month determined by aggregating individually metered kilowatts, adjusted for primary metering as applicable, for each hour of the service and identifying the maximum aggregated kilowatt amount. 
c.  Customer service charges apply for each metered location. 
(3)  Billing. Billing shall be as follows: 
a.  The monthly billed energy (kilowatts per hour) charge shall be the aggregated energy times the applicable energy rate for the particular rate class being aggregated. 
b.  The monthly billed demand charge will be the maximum coincident demand of all meters resulting from the aggregation (integration) of individually metered demands times the applicable demand rate for the particular rate class being aggregated. 
c.  The customer service charge shall be applied to each meter location. 
d.  Discounts offered for primary metering will continue to be given for measurements at the primary level. Primary metering discounts will be computed as if the primary metered location were not being aggregated with other meter locations. The dollar amount of the discount so computed will be applied to the customer's aggregated billing for the month. 
(g)  Term. This rider shall be in force for a period of 12 months from the customer's first billing month and may be renewed by mutual agreement of the customer and the public utilities board. Thereafter, this term shall renew based on mutual agreement of the customer and the public utilities board.

Sec. 102-221. - Experimental economic development rider (EEDRB). 
(a)  Definition. The service furnished under the experimental economic development rider (EEDRB) shall be three phase, 60 hertz, alternating current supplied at 12,500 volts or higher, available through one transformation point. This experimental rider is designed to encourage and retain service to large customers with high load factors which contribute to increased employment in the community. 
(b)  Metering. All costs related to installation, reading, and maintenance of meters, as may be required, will be borne by the public utilities board. 
(c)  Applicability. This rider applies to new or existing customers which qualify for service under the general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates which meet the following criteria: 
(1)  The customer shall make application for this rider which includes, in addition to the normally required customer data, a notarized affidavit from an officer of the customer confirming that this rider was an important contributing factor in the customer's decision to receive electric service for new or additional load. 
(2)  The customer shall provide new or additional load which creates at least 20 permanent new jobs in the community. 
(3)  The added monthly electrical demand of the customer is or is estimated to be at least 600 kilowatts. 
(4)  The monthly load factor will be at least 80 percent. The monthly load factor will be determined as follows: 
Billing load factor, for any billing period, shall be computed as follows: 
BLF = MkWh/(MkW×D×24) 
Where: 
BLF = Billing load factor MkWh = Metered kWh usage MkW = Maximum metered noncoincidental demand D = Number of days in the billing period  
(5)  For existing facilities, the additional energy use is or is expected to be at least 20 percent greater than the base period energy. 
(6)  Application for service under this rider shall be accompanied by sufficiently detailed information to enable the public utilities board to determine whether the new customer or additional load meets the criteria in subsections (c) (1) through (5) of this section. Service under this rider is subject to a determination by the public utilities board that the prospective customer meets the criteria for service under this rider and may be subject to a contract between the customer and the public utilities board containing additional terms and conditions. 
(7)  This rider is not available in conjunction with any other service riders, except the experimental load aggregation rider to customers who are not full requirement customers of the public utilities board or for temporary service for construction power. 
(d)  Rate incentives. 
(1)  [Rate discounts.] The economic development rider (EEDRB) provides a credit of $6.50 per megawatt hour on energy based for customers under the public utilities board's general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates, with loads of 600 kilowatts or more and a monthly load factor of 80 percent or more. For new customers, the incremental energy is the entire monthly energy (kilowatt hours). For existing customers, incremental energy is energy in excess of the base period kilowatt hours. The base period is the 12-month period immediately preceding the month that service is initially provided under this rider divided by 12, or a period mutually agreed upon by the customer and the public utilities board. 
For any billing period where the customer's established metered demand is less than 600 kilowatts or the billing factor is less than 80 percent, billing will be in accordance with the provisions of the public utilities board's general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates, and the discount will not apply to the billing period. 
If this rider is used in conjunction with the primary service or the experimental load aggregation rider, the discount will be applied to the individual billings using individual demand and energy use and the appropriate rates. 
If at any time the public utilities board determines that its marginal average cost of energy for any customer or any new load exceeds the average net energy rates, including the credit, charged under this rider, the public utilities board may, upon 12 months' notice, adjust the rates so that they exceed the marginal average cost of energy. 
The experimental economic development rider provides this discount rate on energy for a specified term after which this discount provision shall cease. 
(2)  Demand billing. Demand rates will remain as provided for under the public utilities board's general service demand (GS-D), general service large demand (GS-LD), or large industrial service (LIS) rates. The base period demand (kilowatts) will be the average monthly demand immediately preceding the month service is initially provided under this rider. 
(3)  Local service facilities. The customer shall not be required to make a contribution in aid of construction for standard facilities installed to serve the customer if the expected revenues from the new load are, in the opinion of the public utilities board, sufficient to justify the required investment in the facilities. A contract for a minimum term of electric service to be taken from the public utilities board may be required. 
(e)  Fuel and purchased energy charge. There shall be added to the base rate of every electric rate schedule the currently effective fuel and purchased energy charge subject to section 102-193. 
(f)  Other charges. All other charges will be in accordance with the provisions of the applicable public utilities board's rates and charges. 
(g)  Term. Service under this rider shall be discontinued if the customer's monthly billing demand falls below 600 kilowatts for more than six consecutive months or if the customer's monthly load factor falls below 80 percent for six consecutive months, unless waived by the public utilities board. 
(h)  Restrictions. Availability of this rider may be frozen with respect to new loads at any time following the first anniversary of the initial offering. Any customer receiving service under this rider on the date it is frozen may continue to receive the benefits of the incentive provisions in this section through the first 12 months of such customer's contract.

The surcharges may become effective when the general manager and CEO, or his/her designee, initiates stage 3 of the drought contingency plan. The water bills shall reflect the effective date of all such charges. The surcharges will remain in effect until Stage 3 of the drought contingency plan is rescinded or until suspended by the general manager and CEO, or his/her designee. The Brownsville PUB expressly finds that drought conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the general and economic health and welfare of its service area, and that the surcharges and other measures adopted herein are essential to protect the public health and welfare. The surcharges and connection fees herein are in no way to be considered rates to generate revenue. 
    It shall be a defense to the imposition of a surcharge hereunder, that water used over the allocation amount resulted from loss of water through no fault of the customer (for example, a major water line break). The customer shall have the burden to prove such defense by objective evidence (for example, a written certification of the circumstances by a plumber). A sworn statement may be required of the customer. This defense shall not apply if the customer failed to: 
(1)  Take reasonable steps for upkeep of the plumbing system; 
(2)  Reasonably inspect the system and discover the leak; 
(3)  Take immediate steps to correct the leak after discovered; or 
(4)  Was in any other way negligent in causing or permitting the loss of water. 
(b)  Residential water customers-Inside and outside city rates. 
(1)  Stage 3 residential surcharges. Residential water customers shall pay a surcharge in addition to the normal charges for the consumption of water. The Brownsville PUB, at the discretion of the general manager and CEO, or his/her designee, to initiate surcharges, will reduce the first residential rate block to 10,000 gallons and increase the rate of the last applicable rate block by 50 percent. Consumption beyond a 10,000-gallon allocation level is deemed to be non-essential water use. Residential water customers shall pay the following surcharge: 
Over 10,000 gallons: 1.50 × current rate. 
(2)  Stage 4 residential water rationing surcharges. Effective with Stage 4, the Brownsville PUB general manager and CEO, or his/her designee, may initiate water rationing and designate a water allocation level less than 10,000 gallons. A water-rationing surcharge shall be levied against all residential water customers during Stage 4 and will represent a 100-percent increase of the last applicable rate block. Consumption beyond the designated water allocation level is deemed to be non-essential water use. Residential water customers shall pay the following water-rationing surcharge: 
Over water allocation amount: 2.00 × current rate. 
(c)  Non-residential water customers. The term "non-residential" shall mean service that does not qualify as residential, wholesale, fire support, or temporary services, and specifically includes service to "single-family attached dwellings" as defined in section 1.2.22 of the policies adopted by the Brownsville PUB. 
(1)  Stage 3 non-residential surcharges. Non-residential water customers, at the discretion of the general manager and CEO, or his/her designee, to initiate surcharges, shall pay a surcharge in addition to the normal charges for the consumption of water. This surcharge represents a 25 percent increase of the non-residential rate for any water used over an amount equal to 80 percent of the customer's monthly average usage for the 12-month period ending prior to the date of implementation of Stage 3. Non-residential water customers shall pay the following surcharge: 
All volumes in excess of monthly allocated amount: 1.25 × current rate. 
(2)  Stage 4 non-residential water rationing surcharges. Effective with Stage 4, the Brownsville PUB general manager and CEO, or his/her designee, may initiate water rationing and designate a water allocation level for each non-residential customer. A water-rationing surcharge shall be levied against all non-residential water customers during Stage 4 and will represent a 25 percent increase of the non-residential rate for any water used over an amount equal to 60 percent of the customer's monthly average usage for the 12-month period ending prior to the date of implementation of Stage 4. Non-residential water customers shall pay the following water-rationing surcharge: 
All volumes in excess of water allocation amount: 1.25 × current rate. 
(d)  Irrigation accounts. At the discretion of the general manager and CEO or his/her designee to initiate surcharges, residential and non-residential customers having a separate irrigation account shall pay a surcharge in addition to the normal charges for the consumption of water. This surcharge shall be a 50 percent increase on the last residential rate block. Residential and non-residential water customers shall pay the following surcharge: 
Monthly water consumption: 1.50 × current rate.

(Ord. No. 2011-795-F, § 1, 2-15-2011) 
Sec. 102-394. - Permit conditions. 
    Industrial user pretreatment permits shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this article and all other applicable regulations, user charges and fees established by the control authority. Permits shall contain at a minimum, the following conditions: 
(1)  Statement of duration, which in no event shall exceed five years and must include permit issuance, expiration, and effective dates. 
(2)  Statement of non-transferability without, at a minimum, prior notification to the POTW, provision of a copy of the existing control mechanism to the new owner or operator, and approval by the pretreatment manager as required in section 102-397. 
(3)  Effluent limits, including best management practices, based on applicable general pretreatment standards in 40 CFR 103, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local law; 
(4)  Self-monitoring, sampling, operation and maintenance, reporting, notification and recordkeeping requirements, including an identification of the pollutants (or best management practice) to be monitored, sampling location, sampling protocol, sampling frequency, and sample type, based on the applicable general pretreatment standards in 40 CFR 403, categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and state and local laws; 
(5)  Statement of applicable civil and criminal penalties for violation of pretreatment standards and requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule. Such schedules may not extend the compliance date beyond applicable federal and state deadlines. 
(6)  Requirements to control slug discharge, if determined by the pretreatment manager to be necessary. 
(7)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(8)  The pretreatment manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, alter informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The pretreatment manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
a.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the pretreatment manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The pretreatment manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the pretreatment manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 102-430 are initiated against the user. 
b.  A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 102-425 or 102-430. 
(9)  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the pretreatment manager to ensure compliance with this article, and state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.

Sec. 102-397. - Permit transfer. 
(a)  Wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least 30 days advance notice to the pretreatment manager and the pretreatment manager approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the pretreatment manager must include a written certification by the new owner or operator which: 
(1)  States that the new owner has no immediate intent to change the facility's operations and processes; 
(2)  Identifies specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and 
(3)  Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing permit. 
(b)  Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer. 
(c)  The pretreatment manager, within ten working days of receiving the permit transfer request, will respond to the parties in writing. In the event the pretreatment manager denies the request, the new owner/operator must submit a permit application in accordance with section 102-391. 
(Ord. No. 2011-795-F, § 1, 2-15-2011) 
Sec. 102-398. - Permit appeals. 
    Once a final permit has been issued by the pretreatment manager, any citizen, including the industrial user, may petition the control authority's general manager in writing to reconsider the permit decision. Failure to submit a petition for review in accordance with the conditions below shall be deemed to be a waiver of the appeal. 
(1)  This permit appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the permit was received by the industrial user. 
(2)  In its notice to the general manager, the appealing party must indicate the permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition it seeks to be placed in the permit. 
(3)  The effectiveness of the permit shall not be stayed pending a reconsideration by the general manager. If, after considering the petition and any arguments put forth by the pretreatment manager, the general manager determines that reconsideration is proper, it shall remand the permit back to the pretreatment manager for reissuance. Those permit provisions being reconsidered by the pretreatment manager shall be stayed pending reissuance. 
(4)  A general manager's decision not to reconsider a final permit shall be a prerequisite to appeal to any court. 
(5)  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a compliant with any court of competent jurisdiction within the appropriate statute of limitations.

Subdivision II. - Reporting Requirements for Categorical Industrial Users 

Sec. 102-403. - Baseline monitoring report. 
(a)  Within 180 days alter the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days alter the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 10 CFR 103.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the pretreatment manager a report which contains the information listed in subsections (a)-(g) of this section. 
(b)  Where reports containing this information already have been submitted to the director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 10 CFR 128.140(b) (1977), the industrial user will not be required to submit this information again. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the pretreatment manager a report which contains the information listed in subsections (a)-(e), (g), and (i) of this section. New sources shall report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections (d) and (e) of this section: 
(1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners; 
(2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
(3)  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production including each product produced by type, amount, processes, and rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates point of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
(4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
a.  Regulated process streams; and 
b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 10 CFR 103.6(e). (See subsection (e)(5) of this section.) 
The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations; 
c.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist including new IUs and existing IUs that make changes or install new treatment; for facilities for which sufficient, representative historical sampling data are available, the pretreatment manager may authorize (in writing) a lower minimum. For the reports required by sections 102-405 and 402-408, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized (in writing) by the control authority. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the User demonstrates (in writing) that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. Using protocols specified in 10 CFR Part 136, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized (in writing) by the control authority as appropriate. Total residual chlorine, pH, and temperature samples cannot be "composited" under any circumstances. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. The decision to allow alternative sampling will be documented in the IU file. 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. For sampling facilities that discharge less than 24 hours per day, the sampling must be representative of the IU's wastewater discharge. Sampling must be taken within a 24-hour period, however, the sample should only be collected during that portion of the 24-hour period that the IU is discharging from the: 
1.  Regulated process; and/or 
2.  Pretreatment unit (as long as regulated process wastewater is flowing through the pretreatment unit). 
During parts of the day when there is no discharge of process wastewater, standing water should not be disproportionately sampled and analyzed as it would not be representative of the discharge from the IU. 
e.  Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 10 CFR 103.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 103.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority. 
f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 10 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 10 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
g.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures. 
h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW. 
(6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and 
(7)  Compliance schedule. A compliance schedule shall be included if additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards. The compliance schedule shall include the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
a.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7) the combined wastestream formula (10 CFR 103.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by sections 402-402 through 102-403, the information required by subsections (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. 
b.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 103.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 103.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (10 CFR 403.13) after the user submits the report required by section 102-403, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the control authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
(8)  Conditions for subsection (b)(7) of this section. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule in subsection (7): 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc). 
b.  No increment referred to in subsection a. above shall exceed nine months. 
c.  No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the control authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
(9)  In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the pretreatment manager or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.

(a)  All significant industrial users are required to submit periodic compliance reports. Any industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the pretreatment manager during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the control authority or the approval authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include flow measurement data for the report period as described in subsection (b)(4) of section 102-403. At the discretion of the pretreatment manager and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the pretreatment manager may alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the pretreatment manager or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(b)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 102-413. 
(c)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.

(b)  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling is not required in the occurrence of the following events: 
(1)  The control authority performs the sampling at the IU at a frequency of at least once per month. 
(2)  The control authority performs sampling at the IU between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the IU or the CA receives the results of the sampling. 
(c)  If the results of the resampling in subsection (b) above indicate continued noncompliance, the user shall submit a schedule for achieving compliance with the applicable pretreatment standard. The compliance schedule shall meet the requirements stipulated in section 102-402. 
(d)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (a), the result of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  The pretreatment manager may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the combined wastewater formula, as outlined in 40 CFR 403.6(e)(ii) shall be used to calculate the mass limitations; and the reports required by in sections 102-402 through 102-413 shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the pretreatment manager, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. 
(f)  All analyses including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to Section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator.

(a)  All industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and the TCEQ hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW if a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notifications must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this rule. Industrial Users who commence discharging after the effective date of this rule shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after commencement of the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under sections 102-410 and 102-411. The notification requirement in these sections does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 102-402 through 102-413. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and TCEQ hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under section 102-411, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

(a)  The control authority shall require to be provided, maintained, and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated at least at the frequency suggested by the manufacturer to ensure their accuracy. 
(b)  The monitoring facilities should normally be situated on the user's premises but the control authority may, when such a location would be impractical, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facility shall be provided in accordance with the control authority's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the control authority; but in no way shall the lack of monitoring facility waive or delay any of the user's reporting requirements under this article.

(1)  The proper and safe functioning of the wrecker business has critical impact on the health, safety and welfare of the public. It involves use of the public streets of the city, often in circumstances that necessitate prompt removal of dangerous obstructions to traffic on such streets; therefore, the privilege of any person to engage in the wrecker business in the city shall be subject to strict regulation in order to protect the public. 
(2)  For purposes of invoking any administrative violation against a permit holder, the acts or omissions of any agent or employee of the permit holder shall be considered to be the acts or omissions of the holder.

c.  It does not presently meet all requirements of certification. 
(5)  Grounds for removal of a permit holder from any wrecker rotation list include the following:

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 300-66. - Applicability. 
    This article shall be applicable to the entire city Code, except when the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
(Code 1971, § 26-200) 
Sec. 300-67. - Intent. 
(a)  In addition to all other procedures and standards relating generally to the issuance of permits and certificates, a system of class permits is established. 
(b)  Such system is intended to: 
(1)  Require special examination, review, and findings by appropriate city entities in connection with certain proposed actions; 
(2)  Relate to use, occupancy, location, construction, design, character, color, scale, manner of operation, or the necessity for making complex or unusual determinations; 
(3)  Allow consideration of the particular circumstances of each case and the establishment of such conditions as are reasonably necessary for protection of the public interest generally and for protection of adjacent properties, the neighborhood, and the city as a whole; and 
(4)  Increase efficiency and reduce time required for processing applications by relating administrative responsibilities and procedural requirements to the degree of complexity and potential impact of the matters being considered. 
(c)  A permit is a grant of authority under the terms of the city Code from and by a designated city entity to an applicant for the use of property in the manner set out in the grant of such permit. Developments requiring a permit under this system and the specific class permit required in each instance are set out in the city Code. 
(d)  Several class permits are established, ranging from those dealing with substantial effects on neighborhoods of the city to those dealing with potentially temporary or small adverse impacts on adjacent or nearby properties. 
(e)  Procedures, standards, and determinations range accordingly from complex to simple. Formal public notice and hearing are only required for certain class permits. 
(f)  Specific class permits, their intent, the entity responsible for granting each, and any referrals thereunder are as summarized in section 300-68 and as detailed in division 2 of this article. 
(Code 1971, § 26-201) 
Sec. 300-68. - Summary of specific class permits. 
    Class W permit (zoning administrator). The summary for a class W permit is as follows: 
(1)  It is intended that class W permits be required when compliance with the zoning ordinance in chapter 348 needs to be monitored or checked more thoroughly than usual. 
(2)  The zoning administrator shall be solely responsible for determinations on applications for class W permits, under section 300-103. 
(3)  The zoning administrator may refer any such application to any entities, through the director, for nonbinding recommendations and findings on such application. 
(Code 1971, § 26-202; Ord. No. 99-1100.27, pt. 4, 6-1-1999) 
Sec. 300-69. - Sequence. 
(a)  Where permits or certificates are required by chapter 18, articles II through V, no such permit or certificate shall be issued where the city Code requires class permits unless and until any and all class permits required have been obtained. 
(b)  Where developments do not require permits or certificates under chapter 18, articles II through V, but are otherwise subject to requirements of the city Code, no such development shall be initiated or maintained unless and until any and all class permits required in relation thereto have been obtained. 
(Code 1971, § 26-203) 
Sec. 300-70. - Applications. 
(a)  Except when specifically set out otherwise in the city Code, applications for class permits shall be filed with the director. The director is charged with responsibility for their receipt, fee collection, processing, and/or distribution. 
(b)  For class permits affecting a property, applications may be filed only by the property owner, his formally designated agent, or a lessee with formal and legally sufficient consent of the property owner, and applications may be made only for class permits specifically authorized and/or required by the city Code. 
(c)  Applications for class permits shall be made on forms provided for the purpose and shall be accompanied by such plans, reports or other information, exhibits, or documents as may be reasonably required to make the necessary findings in the case. 
(d)  For purposes of establishing time limitations on processing, no application shall be deemed to have been filed unless and until: 
(1)  The applications shall have been completed; 
(2)  All plans, reports or other information, exhibits, or documents required by the city Code or administrative rules adopted pursuant thereto shall have been provided; and 
(3)  All fees due at time of filing shall have been paid. 
(e)  During processing of any application, if it is determined by the designated city entity that in the particular circumstances of the case additional information is required to make necessary findings bearing on its approval, denial, or conditions to be attached, such information may be requested. Failure to supply such supplementary information may be used as grounds for denial of the permit. 
(Code 1971, § 26-205) 
Sec. 300-71. - Standards. 
    As appropriate to the nature of the class permit involved and the particular circumstances of the case, the standards in this section shall apply generally, in addition to any other standards set forth concerning the class permit being considered. City entities charged with decisions concerning class permits shall make or cause to be made findings and determinations concerning such of the matters in this section as are applicable in the case; shall reflect such standards specifically in the record; and shall be guided by such standards in their decisions to grant, grant with conditions, or deny class permits. The standards are as follow: 
(1)  In addition to consideration of detailed elements indicated in this section, as appropriate to the specific class permit and the circumstances of the particular case, due consideration shall be given to potentially adverse effects generally on adjoining and nearby premises, the area, the neighborhood, or the city of the proposed use or its location, construction, design, character, color, scale, or manner of operation. Where such potentially adverse effects are found, consideration shall be given to special remedial measures appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case, including screening or buffering, landscaping, control of manner or hours of operation, alteration of proposed design or construction of buildings, relocation of proposed open space or alteration of use of such space, or such other measures as are required to ensure that such potential adverse effects will be eliminated or minimized to the maximum extent reasonably feasible and to ensure that the use will be compatible and harmonious with other development in the area to a degree which will avoid substantial depreciation of the value of nearby premises. 
(2)  Due consideration shall be given to the number, size, character, location, and orientation of proposed signs and of proposed lighting for signs or premises, with particular reference to traffic safety, glare, appearance, and compatibility and harmony with adjoining and nearby premises, the character of the area, and the function or value of nearby roads. 
(3)  Due consideration shall be given to utilities required, with particular reference to availability and capacity of systems, location of connections, and potentially adverse appearance or other adverse effects on adjoining and nearby premises and the character of the area. 
(4)  Due consideration shall be given to the location, scale, design, and screening of refuse and service areas; to the manner in which refuse is to be kept; and to the manner and timing of refuse collection and deliveries, shipments, or other service activities, as such matters relate to the location and nature of uses on adjoining premises and to the location and character of uses on adjoining premises and to the location and character of adjoining roads. 
(5)  Due consideration shall be given to adequacy of ingress to and egress from the premises, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic flow and control, and access during a fire or other emergency. 
(6)  Due consideration shall be given to off-street parking and loading facilities as related to adjacent streets, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and convenience, internal traffic flow and control, arrangement in relation to access during a fire or other emergency, and screening and landscaping. 
(7)  Due consideration shall be given to provision for drainage, with particular reference to effects on adjoining and nearby premises and on general drainage systems in the area. Where major drainage volumes appear likely and capacity of available systems is found marginal or inadequate, consideration shall be given to possibilities for detention or other remedial measures.

    New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    Primary frontal dune means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a relatively mild slope. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Sand dunes mean naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach. 
    Special flood hazard area, see area of special flood hazard. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance means a grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain management regulation. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.) 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section 308-30 the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article III. 
i.  When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
j.  Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, a community may approve certain development in Zones A1-30, AE, AH, on the community's FIRM which increases the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot, provided that the community first completes all of the provisions required by Section 65.12. 
(Ord. No. 2018-1638, § 1, 2-6-2018) 
Sec. 308-89. - Permit procedures. 
(a)  Application for a floodplain development permit shall be presented to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him/her and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the location, dimensions, and elevation of proposed landscape alterations, existing and proposed structures, including the placement of manufactured homes, and the location of the foregoing in relation to areas of special flood hazard.

(5)  Maintain a record of all such information in accordance with section 308-88(a)(1)a. 
(b)  Approval or denial of a floodplain development permit by the floodplain administrator shall be based on all of the provisions of this chapter and the following relevant factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(2)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(3)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(4)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(5)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(6)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of streets and bridges, and public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; 
(7)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;

Sec. 308-90. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board of adjustment shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustment may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
(f)  Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in section 308-89(b) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(g)  Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter section 308-26. 
(h)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(i)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(j)  Prerequisites for granting variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(2)  Variances shall only be issued upon: (i) showing a good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(3)  Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(k)  Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in section 308-90(a) through (i) are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(Ord. No. 2018-1638, § 1, 2-6-2018) 
Sec. 308-143. - Specific standards. 
(a)  In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) section 308-30, (ii) section 308-88(a)(1)h., or section 308-144(c), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in section 308-89(a)(1), is satisfied. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  A minimum of two openings on separate walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
1.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. 
2.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
(b)  Manufactured homes. 
(1)  Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(2)  Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
(3)  Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of section 308-143(b) of this section be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

(1)  Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the permit requirements of section 308-89(a)(1) and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in section 308-143(b) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. 
(Ord. No. 2018-1638, § 1, 2-6-2018) 
Sec. 308-144. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with sections 308-26 and 308-28 of this chapter. 
(b)  All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet floodplain development permit requirements of section 308-31; section 308-89; and the provisions of article III of this chapter. 
(c)  Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to section 308-30 or section 308-88(a)(1)h. of this chapter. 
(d)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(e)  All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 2018-1638, § 1, 2-6-2018) 
Sec. 308-145. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). 
(a)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 308-30 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures: 
a.  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base specified flood depth in an AO Zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH Zone, level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
(3)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 308-89 are satisfied. 
(4)  Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2018-1638, § 1, 2-6-2018) 
Sec. 308-146. - Coastal high hazard areas. 
(a)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 308-30 are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (Zones V1-30, VE, and/or V). These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from tidal surges and hurricane wave wash; therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions outlined in this chapter, the following provisions must also apply: 
(1)  Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
(2)  All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
(3)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that: 
a.  The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; 
b.  The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsection (3)a. and b. of this section. 
c.  Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
(4)  For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions: 
a.  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
b.  The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards. Such enclosed space shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation. 
(5)  Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings. 
(6)  Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands that increase potential flood damage. 
(7)  Manufactured homes. Require that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved within Zone V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, meet the standards of paragraphs (1) through (6) of this section and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM meet the requirements of section 308-143(b) of this chapter. 
(8)  Recreational vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones V1-30, V, and VE on the community's FIRM either (i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or (ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or (iii) meet the requirements in section 308-31 of this ordinance and paragraphs (1) through (6) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.

Sec. 320-36. - Generally. 
    This chapter provides for the construction and maintenance of sidewalks on private property throughout the city for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 320-37. - Design standards. 
(a)  All sidewalks installed within the city shall comply with city design standards for width, location, construction material, finish, appearance and structural quality. City design standards, as that term is used in this chapter, shall mean the following: 
(1)  Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete unless otherwise approved by the engineering department 
(2)  Sidewalks shall be four feet in width, and located adjacent and parallel to the property line with a minimum unpaved parkway width of four feet. The parkway width is the distance from the back of curb to the leading edge of the sidewalk. 
(3)  If physical constraints, sidewalk continuity, urban type development or other factors require sidewalks to be placed against the back of curb, the width of sidewalk shall be increased to a minimum of five feet. In locations where buildings are typically constructed at the property line (for example, in the downtown area), the minimum sidewalk width shall either be (a) seven and one-half feet; or (b) the distance between the property line and the leading edge of the street or the back edge of the curb if applicable if said distance is less than seven and one-half feet. 
(4)  Wherever sidewalks are constructed, the remaining parkway width, whether between the curb and sidewalk or sidewalk and property line, shall remain unpaved. 
(5)  "Meandering" sidewalks are permitted but shall be no closer than four feet from the back of the curb at the nearest point. 
(6)  If any connection opportunities exist, sidewalks must be connected. Additionally, it shall be the duty of the developer or owner of the lot or parcel of land to ensure the continuation of all existing sidewalks and shall match existing widths and dimensions. The lot owner shall assume the responsibility of installation, maintenance and repair of the required sidewalks along the frontage(s) upon occupying the structure on the lot. 
(b)  Sidewalks and related sidewalk ramps shall conform to Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Texas Accessibility Standards requirements. 
(c)  All sidewalks shall be setback/offset a minimum of two feet from street curbs, edges of asphalt or grade lines. Sidewalks shall be at least four feet wide and shall be located between the street curb, edge of asphalt or grade line of the public street and the ROW line or public access easement if approved by the city. The city engineer may alter alignment so that the sidewalk meanders within the area between the curb and right-of-way line. 
(1)  In the event that an owner of a lot or parcel of land cannot install the sidewalks with the two-foot setback/offset, then the owner must contact the city in writing and consult with the planning or engineering department, and obtain a written notice allowing for an alternative design. 
(d)  The specific design and location of all sidewalks must be in accordance with the current subdivision sidewalk plan however if no such plan exists as part of the subdivision, the design and location shall be reviewed by the building, engineering, and planning departments before being approved. The city engineer, planning and building official must be in agreement and may alter alignment so that the sidewalk meanders within the area between the curb and right-of-way line. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011; Ord. No. 2016-1600.02, 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 320-38. - Newly-developing areas. 
(a)  Sidewalks are required on both sides of all publicly-maintained streets within the city. 
(b)  The location and design of sidewalks shall normally be determined during the subdivision process or if subdivision has already occurred then at the site review/building permit process. 
(c)  Due to the potential damage sidewalks can incur during the construction of homes and other buildings, sidewalks should not be installed until building work has been completed on individual properties. Exceptions may be made for streets that are without direct property access. 
(d)  Implementation and construction costs of all sidewalks in newly developing areas shall be paid for by the developer, builder or property owner. The city shall not be liable for any sidewalk implementation or construction costs. 
(e)  All required sidewalks shall be installed prior to final inspection or issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 320-39. - Redeveloping areas. 
(a)  A redeveloping or redeveloped area, as those terms are used in this chapter means the issuance of a building permit for construction that equals or exceeds 50 percent of the appraised value of any existing improvements as determined by the appraisal district in which the property is located. 
(b)  Sidewalks shall be required in redeveloping areas in the same manner as in "newly developing areas" when redevelopment occurs. 
(c)  The cost of required sidewalks shall be paid for by the developer, builder or property owner; the city will not participate in the cost. 
(d)  When the development is single family residential and in an existing subdivision the requirement for sidewalks will be determined as follows: If sidewalks already exist on more than 40 percent of the street frontage then a sidewalk will be required. If no sidewalks exist on that particular street and no connections can be made then sidewalks will not be required. 
(e)  All required sidewalks shall be installed prior to final inspection or issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 320-40. - Existing developed areas. 
(a)  New sidewalks. New sidewalks may be installed in existing developed areas by either of the following methods: 
(1)  By the property owner at property owner's expense. Property owners may construct sidewalks along their property frontage at their expense. Sidewalks constructed by individual property owners shall conform to city design standards and will be inspected by the city at no expense to the property owner. 
a.  Sidewalks constructed by private property owners must be constructed by qualified bonded contractors under permit by the city building department. 
(2)  By the city at city's expense. The city may install sidewalks to enhance the safety and convenience of pedestrians. Priority is given to continuous sidewalks that serve a higher number of pedestrians on more heavily-traveled streets or where children typically walk to schools, parks and community centers. City staff prioritizes locations and these are approved by city commission annually. The number of sidewalks constructed each year is dependent upon funding availability. The city may also install sidewalks as part of a city-funded street reconstruction or public building construction project. 
(b)  Replacement sidewalks. The maintenance and repair of sidewalks is the responsibility of each individual property owner. The city reserves the right to inspect all sidewalks within city rights-of-way and to notify property owners to make repairs when their sidewalks become unsafe. 
(1)  Examples of conditions rendering sidewalks unsafe shall include but not be limited to: 
a.  Uneven sidewalks. 
b.  Broken concrete. 
c.  Overgrown weeds. 
(2)  Where sidewalk repair or replacement is impractical due to physical conditions or lack of right-of-way, the city may elect to remove the sidewalk and return the property to grass. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 320-41. - Sidewalk plans.

(1)  Location of sidewalks, landings, and curb ramps. 
(2)  Design specifications and details. 
(3)  Identify the party responsible for the construction of the sidewalks. 
(b)  Sidewalk plans will be reviewed during the subdivision process and approved by the city engineering and planning departments. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 320-42. - Special provisions. 
    If special conditions make sidewalk construction infeasible, unnecessary or undesirable, and such conditions have been verified by city staff, the sidewalk requirement may be waived. Such waivers shall be only be granted by the board of adjustments upon submission of an application requesting a hearing before the board of adjustments. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1600.00, pt. 1, 12-13-2011) 
Sec. 320-43. - Enforcement and penalties; severability. 
    A violation of any provision of this chapter shall be punishable in accordance with section 1-13. The terms and provisions of this article are severable in accordance with section 1-12.

ARTICLE IV. - STANDARDS 

Sec. 332-166. - General standards. 
(a)  General requirements. General requirements for subdivisions are as follow: 
(1)  Streets. Streets in general must conform to the following: 
a.  The minimum width of right-of-way or right-of-way easement for any nonarterial street shall be 50 feet. 
b.  Streets shall be in line with existing arterial streets in adjoining subdivisions, unless a junction with existing streets will be harmful to the character of the subdivision. The minimum width of arterial streets shall be 80 feet. 
c.  Streets shall be named to provide continuity with existing streets. 
d.  Dead-end streets shall be avoided, except for future planning or for protection of the character of the subdivision. 
e.  Streets shall platted with appropriate regard to all topographical features lending themselves to attractive treatment and layout of utilities. All approaches to arterial streets shall be perpendicular for safety purposes. 
f.  Street curb height shall be as specified by the city engineer. However, such height shall never be greater than six inches and shall never be less than four inches, except for the actual width of any sidewalk curb ramp, driveway, alley, or similar feature. 
g.  All intersecting streets shall be perpendicular to each other. 
(2)  Parcels. Parcel dimensions shall be as follows: 
a.  In no case shall any parcel be less than 3,000 square feet in net area. 
b.  In no case shall any parcel's average length be more than four times greater than such parcel's average width, as calculated by the city engineer for such parcel's net area. (See the exception under section 332-224.) 
c.  In no case shall the average width of any parcel be less than 40 feet. 
d.  In no case shall any parcel's front width be narrower than 20 feet on a curbed street or on any private street or narrower than 100 feet on a noncurbed public street. Each parcel shall abut a street. (See the exceptions under sections 332-224, 332-226 and 332-227.) 
(b)  Improvements. Standards for improvements are as follows: 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section and sections 332-167(b), 332-223 and 332-229, the construction documents shall include all of the following items: road pavement, stand-up curb and gutter, sidewalk curb ramps and landings, proposed or potential sidewalks and passing spaces, water lines, fire hydrants, sanitary sewer lines, manholes, laterals, storm drainage facilities, street signs, streetlights, utility easements, drainage easements, corner clips, monuments, and other appropriate items. 
(2)  Except as otherwise specified, the city engineer shall have authority to waive one or more of the items listed in subsection (b)(1) of this section if, and only if, the item does not need to be constructed because the item already exists or because such construction would be contrary to good engineering practice. 
(3)  All items included in the construction documents shall be designed in accordance with good engineering practices acceptable to the city engineer and the public utilities board. 
(4)  The subdivider shall provide at his expense the proper size of utilities improvements as outlined in this subsection for his subdivision. If the planning and zoning commission, in cooperation with the city engineer and the public utilities board, believes that the lines need to be larger to provide for future growth of other subdivisions, the public utilities board shall pay for the difference in cost in order to get the larger lines. 
(5)  The minimum width of the pavement shall be 32 feet back to back of curb. If it is deemed by the planning and zoning commission that such street shall carry through traffic and therefore needs to be wider, the subdivider shall pay for the 32 feet, including curb and gutter, and the city shall pay for whatever additional width it deems necessary for good planning and future growth. If such street may have traffic heavier than residential traffic with through traffic, the subdivider shall pay for the thickness as outlined in the schedule for pavement of streets for residential streets, and the city shall pay for any additional thickness that is deemed desirable. 
(6)  This subsection shall be applicable to any dedicated or prescriptive street right-of-way which abuts the outside boundary of the proposed subdivision and which provides ingress to any parcel of the subdivision in accordance with the following: 
a.  If the subdivision is a minor plat, the only applicable pavement standards for such abutting right-of-way shall be as follows: 
1.  Compacted caliche at least four inches deep and at least 20 feet wide complying with state specifications; or 
2.  Equivalent standards acceptable to the city engineer. 
b.  If the subdivision is not a minor plat, the only applicable pavement standards for such abutting right-of-way shall be as follows: 
1.  Hot mix asphalt concrete at least two inches deep and 24 feet wide plus prime coat and/or tack coat plus caliche base course at least six inches deep and at least 28 feet wide plus subbase course at least six inches deep and at least 32 feet wide, with all of such adhering to state specifications; or 
2.  Equivalent standards acceptable to the city engineer. 
c.  Before final plat approval, the applicant shall show that: 
1.  Such abutting right-of-way already met applicable standards; 
2.  The applicant has already improved such abutting right-of-way to applicable standards; or 
3.  The applicant has promised to improve such abutting right-of-way to applicable standards and has provided a cash deposit or letter of credit acceptable to the city engineer and city attorney for 100 percent of the cost of meeting applicable standards. If any such promised improvements are not completed by the applicant during the first year after plat approval, the city shall use those financial guarantees to make such improvements during the second year after plat approval. 
(7)  If either the public utilities board or a utility district provides trunk lines for sanitary sewer and water lines to the subdivision property line in accordance with rules established by such entity, such proposed subdivision inside the city's jurisdiction shall have public water and shall connect with the sanitary sewer system in accordance with the rules and regulations established by both such entity and the city engineer. If the public utility board or a utility district refuses for any reason to provide such trunk lines to the applicant, the applicant may seek to apply for the exception provided in section 332-223. 
(c)  Bonds. Bonds shall be given as follows: 
(1)  The subdivider must give a good and sufficient performance bond for the proper construction of such streets and alleys and all improvements in accordance with this chapter. The bond must be executed by some surety company authorized to do business in the state and will be made payable to the city and conditioned that the subdivider will construct streets within such subdivision and improvements in accordance with plans and specifications and in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The bond shall be in an amount equal to $50.00 for each linear foot of street in the section of the subdivision to be developed. It is the intent of this subsection to allow a subdivider to develop the subdivision by sections, and the subdivider is required only to give bond for the streets and improvements in the section which will be developed immediately; however, the subdivider will be required to give a good and sufficient performance bond to the city for the proper construction of the streets and improvements in any other section of the subdivision which may be developed at a later date in accordance with any final plat which may be approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(2)  If expense will be incurred by the city in extending either water or sewer or storm sewer trunk lines to serve the subdivision, the subdivider must furnish the following: 
a.  A written estimate, signed by the city manager, of the total expense which will be incurred by the city in extending either water or sewer or storm sewer trunk lines to serve the subdivision. 
b.  A performance bond for the subdivider's development of the proposed subdivision. The bond shall be made payable to the city and conditioned that the subdivider will develop the proposed subdivision in accordance with the terms of his final plat and the minimum subdivision requirements. The bond shall be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the total expense set forth in the estimate which will be incurred by the city in extending either water or sewer or storm sewer trunk lines to serve the subdivision. The bond shall be either from a surety company holding a permit from the state to act as surety or from some other surety acceptable to the city. 
(3)  If a required performance bond amounts to less than $50,000.00, the applicant may submit either such bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in a form acceptable to the city attorney and city engineer. 
(d)  As-built plans. The subdivider must, in writing, agree to present to the city reproducible complete as-built plans for all paving, drainage structures, water lines and sewer lines within 30 days after completion of such improvements.

The contract shall be approved by the city attorney and the dedication accepted by the city parks and recreation board. 
(i)  All costs of dedication, including the title survey and land survey, pre-existing taxes, recording fees, and other dedication costs shall be paid by the developer. 
(j)  The following shall be excluded from the calculation for the parkland dedication requirement: 
(1)  Wetlands or resacas which would require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of fill or dredge material shall not be accepted as satisfaction of parkland dedication requirements. 
a.  Wetlands or resacas which shall not be accepted as satisfaction of the parkland dedication requirement may be donated as a gift to the city for use as recreational open space. 
(2)  Any land where proposed storm water drainage features will be incorporated. This is to include storm water retention ponds, swails, and other engineered drainage features. 
(Ord. No. 2010-1479-B, pt. 1, 4-20-2010)

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Cross reference- Planning and development, ch. 320. 

Sec. 332-286. - Purpose. 
    The objectives of this division are to: 
(1)  Encourage flexibility in design and permit a greater diversity of building types and lotting arrangements; 
(2)  Promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic arrangement of buildings, vehicular and pedestrian access, land use and utilities; 
(3)  Preserve existing landscape features and amenities and utilize such features in a proper manner; 
(4)  Allow increased usable and suitably located open space, recreation facilities and other public or private common facilities; and 
(5)  Provide a program of operation and maintenance of all such facilities and improvements for the common use of occupants within the planned development. 
(Ord. No. 90-1211, § 95, 3-13-1990) 
Sec. 332-287. - Concept plan. 
(a)  Generally. A developer or owner of land proposing a planned development (PD) is required to submit a concept plan for all the land under his ownership or control prior to subdividing the land or any portion of the land. Property partly developed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this division derives (March 13, 1990) may qualify as a planned development provided the developer's concept plan for the undeveloped remainder also includes the existing improvements. This concept plan, when approved by the planning commission, constitutes a guide which the planning commission will refer to in the subsequent review of plats that cover all or portions of the land contained within the overall concept plan. Should the developer's future plans change, such changes are to be disclosed to the city by submitting a revised concept plan for planning commission review and approval. 
(b)  Requirements and submissions. Requirements and submissions for the concept plan are as follows: 
(1)  A filing fee of $50.00 plus $5.00 per acre shall be submitted with the concept plan. 
(2)  Fifteen copies of the concept plan shall be submitted to the city for review at least two weeks before the date at which planning commission review is desired. The concept plan should show the following information: 
a.  Name of proposed development if known, which cannot be a duplicate of any other name used within the city's jurisdiction, and the names of owners of property adjoining the tract as disclosed by the most recent ad valorem tax record. 
b.  If practical, a sheet size of 24 inches by 36 inches is preferred. 
c.  Location or vicinity map to show location of the tract within the city or the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
d.  North arrow pointing to the top of the sheet if practical. 
e.  Date; each revision to bear a new date. 
f.  If practical, a scale of one inch equals 100 feet is preferred. 
g.  Property boundary lines to scale and the acreage of the land. 
h.  Existing structures: the approximate locations of all existing structures within the tract. 
i.  Existing features: all existing streets, parking areas, easements, public utilities, drainageways, high banks of watercourses, resacas and other significant physical features or developments both within the tract and within 100 feet of it. 
j.  Flood hazard areas, approximated from flood insurance rate maps. 
k.  Proposed features: the approximate location of proposed streets, parking areas, easements, public utilities, storm drainage outfalls, high banks of watercourses. 
l.  Areas proposed to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved for parks; parkways; compensating open space; and private, public, or semipublic facilities. 
m.  Other information: If known and where applicable, show the location of proposed blocks and lots, reserves, building setback lines, footprints of buildings, number of stories and proposed usage. 
(3)  A set of covenants, restrictions, conditions and reservations shall be filed with the concept plan if the plan proposes any common areas, compensating open space, recreational facilities, private streets or private alleys. The covenants and restrictions shall: 
a.  Provide an association of lot owners charged with the responsibility of promoting the recreation, health, safety and welfare of the association members. 
b.  Provide for the improvement and maintenance of the compensating open space, private streets, alleys, or parking areas, or other private improvements. 
c.  Empower the association to levy assessments for maintenance costs and, in general, enforcing the covenants, restrictions, conditions, and reservations affecting the property. 
d.  Outline design standards to ensure a quality appearance of the proposed development. 
Upon final platting, the assessments levied shall be a continuing lien on the property against which each such assessment is made. The proposed set of covenants, restrictions, conditions, and reservations shall be reviewed by the city to ensure conformance with this division and shall be recorded at the time of final platting. 
(c)  Action by planning commission. All concept plans require approval from the planning commission. Following review of the concept plan, the planning commission shall, within 30 calendar days of the filing date, take one of the following actions: 
(1)  Approve the concept plan as submitted; 
(2)  Conditionally approve the concept plan as submitted, with the reasons for the conditional approval stated in writing and signed by the chairman of the planning commission; 
(3)  Disapprove the concept plan as submitted, with the reasons for such disapproval stated in writing and signed by the chairman of the planning commission. 
Commission action shall be noted on copies of the concept plan, with one copy returned to the developer. Failure of the planning commission to act within 30 days from the date the plan was submitted to the city will cause the plan to be deemed approved. Commission approval of the concept plan authorizes the developer to file a preliminary plat, final plat or development site plan. Conditional approval requires submitting an amended concept plan and additional information as specified by the planning commission for approval. If additional information is required, the information may be submitted concurrently with the preliminary or final plat. Should the developer or subdivision fail to file a preliminary plat, final plat, or development site plan within one year of planning commission approval of the concept plan, approval of such concept plan shall terminate upon written notice to the developer, subdivider, or owner. The developer, subdivider, or owner may request in writing a one-year extension specifying the reason why a preliminary plat, final plat, or development site plan has not been filed. 
(Ord. No. 90-1211, § 96, 3-13-1990) 
Sec. 332-288. - Guidelines. 
(a)  The purpose of the guidelines in this subsection is to establish a general checklist for preparing and reviewing planned development proposals.

Departures from these requirements may be considered for approval or disapproval by the planning commission or on appeal by the city commission. The guidelines are as follows: 
(1)  Project size. The project size shall be a minimum of five acres, or less if approved by the planning commission. 
(2)  Minimum access. Minimum access to a planned development shall be 50 feet on a dedicated street. 
(3)  Public streets. Public streets shall meet city standards for right-of-way, paving width, pavement thickness, curb and gutter.

Dead-end private streets must be terminated by a circular cul-de-sac having a paving radius of not less than 40 feet or a T-type or L-type turnaround as shown in appendix A to Ordinance No. 90-1211. Private streets are to be designated as "private" on the plat. 
(5)  Driveways. Private drives shall meet city standards for curb cuts, if the intersecting street is curbed, and widths. 
(6)  Alleys. No alleys are required, but if constructed they shall meet city standards. For private alleys, the easement line may be coterminous with the edge of the pavement. Private alleys are to be designated as "private" on the plat. 
(7)  Lot size. A lot may have a gross area of not less than 1,500 square feet with the minimum width not less than 20 feet. 
(8)  Compensating open space. Where a proposed lot will have a gross area less than 3,000 square feet, compensating open space must be established and provided within the final plat boundary. The amount of compensating open space required per platted lot must be no less than the difference between 3,000 square feet and the gross area of the lot. Areas for compensating open space shall be designated on the plan or plat and are restricted to landscaping and recreational uses only. Furthermore, such areas shall be in reasonable proximity to lotted areas and shall be usable for its intended purpose. 
(9)  Building setbacks. A minimum ten-foot setback is required along the planned development boundaries except where adjacent to existing public streets, in which case a minimum 20-foot setback is required. 
(10)  Parking. On-street parking is prohibited along private streets with pavement widths of less than 28 feet.

    The Subdivider covenants that the wastewater collection system will be constructed as shown in the Plans and as provided for through the plat approval process so that the residents of the lots of the Subdivision may receive wastewater treatment service from the Utility. Upon completion of the wastewater collection system and upon its approval and acceptance by the Utility, the Subdivider will convey to the Utility all right and title to the wastewater collection system. 
[Insert the following paragraph if the Utility imposes any fees for connection of individual lots to the Utility's wastewater collection and treatment system:] 
    The Subdivider has paid the Utility the sum of $_____ which sum represents the total costs of tap fees, capital recovery charges, and other fees associated with connecting the individual lots in the Subdivision to the Utility's wastewater collection and treatment system.

Recitals: 
3. Subdivider is the owner of the land included in the proposed final subdivision plat of the subdivision, as shown in City's File Number F-_______ (the Subdivision) and more particularly described by the metes and bounds description attached and incorporated into this Agreement as Exhibit A (the Property); and 
4. Subdivider seeks authorization from the City to subdivide the Property in accordance with the requirements imposed by Texas statute and the City's ordinances, regulations, and other requirements; and 
5. City ordinances require the completion of various improvements in connection with the development of the Subdivision to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the community and to limit the harmful effects of substandard subdivisions; and 
6. The purpose of this Agreement is to protect the City from the expense of completing subdivision improvements required to be installed by the Subdivider; and 
7. This agreement is authorized by and consistent with state law and the City's ordinances, regulations, and other requirements governing development of a subdivision. 
IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing recitals and the mutual covenants, promises, and obligations by the parties set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows: 
Subdivider's Obligations: 
8. Improvements. 
The Subdivider agrees to construct and install, at Subdivider's expense, all subdivision improvements required to comply with City orders, ordinances, regulations, and policies governing subdivision approval, specifically including without limitation those improvements listed on Exhibit B attached and incorporated by reference into this Agreement (collectively, the Improvements, any one of which is an Improvement). All Improvements shall be constructed in conformity to the City's requirements, procedures, and specifications, pursuant to construction plans, permits, and specifications approved by the City prior to commencement of construction, and subject to inspection, certification, and acceptance by the City. 
9. Completion. 
Unless a different time period is specified for a particular Improvement in Exhibit B, construction of all the Improvements shall be completed no later than three years after the Effective Date (the Completion Date); provided, however, that if the Subdivider or the Issuer delivers to the City no later than the Completion Date a substitute Letter of Credit satisfying the criteria established by Paragraph 11 and which has an expiration date no earlier than one year from the Completion Date, then the Completion Date shall be extended to the expiration date of that substitute Letter of Credit or any subsequent substitute Letter of Credit provided in accordance with this Paragraph. Upon completion of each of the Improvements, the Subdivider agrees to provide to the City a complete set of construction plans for the Improvements, certified "as built" by the engineer responsible for preparing the approved construction plans and specifications. 
10. Warranty. 
The Subdivider warrants the Improvements constructed by Subdivider or Subdivider's agents, contractors, employees, tenants, or licensees will be free from defects for a period of one year from the date the City accepts the dedication of a completed Improvement or group of Improvements (the Warranty Period), as such Improvement or group of Improvements is separately identified and listed on Exhibit B, except the Subdivider does not warrant the Improvements for defects caused by events outside the control of the Subdivider or the Subdivider's agents, contractors, employees, tenants, or licensees. The Subdivider agrees to repair any damage to the Improvements before and during the Warranty Period due to private construction-related activities. As a condition of the City's acceptance of dedication of any of the Improvements, the City may require the Subdivider to post a maintenance bond or other financial security acceptable to the City to secure the warranty established by this Agreement. If the Improvements have been completed but not accepted, and neither the Subdivider nor Issuer is then in default under this Agreement or the Letter of Credit, at the written request of the Subdivider or the Issuer the City shall complete, execute, and deliver to the Issuer a reduction letter documenting that the Stated Amount has been reduced to an amount equal to the face amount of the maintenance bond or other financial security acceptable to the City. 
11. Security. 
To secure the performance of Subdivider's obligations under this Agreement, Subdivider agrees to provide adequate financial guarantees of performance in the form of a surety bond acceptable to the City, a cash deposit to be held by the City in escrow, or an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of _____ Dollars ($_____) (the Stated Amount), which amount is the estimated total cost of constructing each of the Improvements as shown on Exhibit B. If a letter of credit is provided pursuant to this Agreement, it shall be in a standard form acceptable to the City, shall have an expiration date no earlier than one year from the date of its issuance, and shall be issued by a financial institution having a rating equivalent to the minimum acceptable rating established under the City's financial-institution-rating system in effect at the time the initial letter of credit is issued pursuant to this Agreement (the Issuer). During the term of this Agreement and subject to the terms of Paragraph 22 of this Agreement, the City may revise the standard form letter of credit it reasonably considers acceptable and necessary to secure the performance of Subdivider's obligations under this agreement. A letter of credit satisfying the criteria of this Paragraph (and any substitute or confirming letter of credit) is referenced to in this agreement as the "Letter of Credit." 
12. Reduction In letter of credit. 
After the acceptance of any Improvement, the amount which the City is entitled to draw on the Letter of Credit shall be reduced by an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Quoted cost of the accepted Improvement, as shown on Exhibit B. Upon completion of an Improvement, at the written request of Subdivider or Issuer, and if neither the Subdivider nor Issuer is then in default under this agreement or the Letter of Credit, the City shall complete, execute, and deliver to the Issuer a reduction letter verifying the acceptance of the Improvement and documenting that the Stated Amount has been reduced by stating the balance of the Stated Amount remaining after the reduction required by the first sentence of this Paragraph. No later than 60 days after its receipt of a written request to reduce the Stated Amount submitted by the Subdivider or the Issuer, the City shall determine the Estimated Remaining Cost and shall complete, execute, and deliver to the Issuer a reduction letter documenting that the Stated Amount has been reduced to the Estimated Remaining Cost if the City determines the Stated Amount exceeds the Estimated Remaining Cost. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the City shall not be required to authorize reductions in the Stated Amount more frequently than every 90 days. As used in this Paragraph, "Estimated Remaining Cost" means the amount the City estimates to be the cost of completing all Improvements which are incomplete as of the time of such estimate. 
City's Obligations: 
13. Inspection and certificate. 
The City agrees to inspect Improvements during and at the completion of construction and, if completed in accordance with the standards and specifications for such Improvements, to certify the Improvements as being in compliance with City standards and specifications. The inspections and certifications will be conducted in accordance with standard City policies and requirements. The Subdivider grants the City, its agents, employees, officers, and contractors an easement and license to enter the Property to perform such inspections as it deems appropriate. 
14. Notice of defect. 
The City will provide timely notice to the Subdivider. Whenever inspection reveals that an Improvement is not constructed or completed in accordance with the standards and specifications for health or safety, and the notice of defect includes a statement explaining why the defect creates such immediate and substantial harm, the cure period may be shortened to no less than five days and the City may declare a default under this Agreement if not satisfied that the defect is cured after the cure period. Any cure period should be reasonable in relation to the nature of the default. 
15. Use of proceeds. 
The City will disburse funds drawn under the Letter of Credit only for the purposes of completing the Improvements in conformance with the City's requirements and specifications for the Improvements, or to correct defects in or failures of the Improvements. The Subdivider has no claim or rights under this Agreement to funds drawn under the Letter of Credit or any accrued interest earned on the funds. All funds obtained by the City pursuant to one or more draws under the Letter of Credit shall be maintained by the City in an interest bearing account or accounts until such funds, together with accrued interest thereon (the Escrowed Funds), are disbursed by the City. The City may disperse all or portions of the Escrowed Funds as Improvements are completed and accepted by the City, or in accordance with the terms of a written construction contract between the City and a third party for the construction of Improvements, Escrowed Funds not used or held by the City for the purpose of completing an Improvement or correcting defects in or failures of an Improvement, together with interest accrued thereon, shall be paid by the City to the Issuer of the Letter of Credit no later than 60 days following the City's acceptance of the Improvement or its decision not to complete the Improvement using Escrowed Funds, whichever date is earlier. 
16. Return of excess escrowed funds. 
No later than 60 days after its receipt of a written request from the Subdivider or the Issuer to return Excess Escrowed Funds to the Issuer, the City shall disburse to the Issuer from the Escrowed Funds all Excess Escrowed Funds. For purposes of this Paragraph, "Excess Escrowed Funds" means the amount of Escrowed Funds exceeding one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost of constructing Improvements the City intends to construct but which have not been accepted, as such cost is shown on Exhibit B. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this Paragraph, the City shall not be required to disburse Excess Escrowed Funds more frequently than every 90 days. 
17. Cost participation by City. 
If the City and Subdivider agree the City will participate in the expense of installing any of the Improvements, the respective benefits and obligations of the parties shall be governed by the terms of a Community Facilities Construction Agreement executed by the parties thereto, and the terms of that agreement shall control to the extent of any inconsistency with this Agreement. 
18. Conditions of draw on security. 
The City may draw upon any financial guarantee posted in accordance with Paragraph 11 upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: 
(a)  Subdivider's failure to construct the Improvements in accordance with Paragraph 8 of this Agreement; 
(b)  Subdivider's failure to renew or replace the Letter of Credit at least forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration date of the Letter of Credit; 
(c)  Subdivider's failure to replace or confirm the Letter of Credit if the Issuer fails to maintain the minimum rating acceptable to the City, in accordance with Paragraph 11 of this Agreement; or 
(d)  Issuer's acquisition of the Property or a portion of the Property, through foreclosure or an assignment or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure. 
The City shall provide written notice of the occurrence of one or more of the above events to the Subdivider, with a copy provided to the Issuer. Where a Letter of Credit has been provided as the financial guarantee, with respect to an event described by subparagraph (a), the City shall provide notice to the Subdivider and the Issuer of the specific default and the notice shall include a statement that the City intends to perform some or all of Subdivider's obligations under Paragraph 8 for specified Improvements if the failure is not cured. The notice with respect to a default under subparagraph (a) shall be given no less than 20 days before presentation of a draft on the Letter of Credit, unless, in the reasonable opinion of the City, the failure creates an immediate and substantial harm to the public health or safety, in which case the notice shall state why the failure creates an immediate and substantial harm to the public health or safety, and shall be given no less than five days before presentation of a draft on the Letter of Credit. In the event of a draw based on subparagraph (a), the City shall be entitled to draw in the amount it considers necessary to perform Subdivider's obligations under Paragraph 8, up to the amount allocated according to Exhibit B for any Improvement it states its intent to construct or complete in accordance with the standards and specifications for such improvement. The subdivider hereby grants to the City, its successors, assigns, agents, contractors, and employees, a nonexclusive right and easement to enter the Property for the purposes of constructing, maintaining, and repairing such Improvements. Where a Letter of Credit has been provided as the financial guarantee, with respect to an event described by subparagraphs (b), (c), or (d), the notice shall be given no less than 20 days before presentation of a draft on the Letter of Credit. In lieu of honoring a draft based on an event described in subparagraphs (b) or (c), the Issuer or the Subdivider may deliver to the City a substitute Letter of Credit if the event is described by subparagraph (b) or a substitute or confirming Letter of Credit if the event is described by subparagraph (c). If the Issuer has acquired all or a portion of the Property through foreclosure or an assignment or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, in lieu of honoring a draft based on an event described in subparagraph (d), the Issuer may deliver to the City a substitute or confirming Letter of Credit. 
19. Procedures for drawing on the letter of credit. 
The City may draw upon the Letter of Credit in accordance with Paragraph 18 by submitting a draft to the Issuer in compliance with the terms of the Letter of Credit governing such draft. The Letter of Credit must be surrendered upon presentation of any draft which exhausts the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit. The City may not draft under a Letter of Credit unless it has substantially complied with all its obligations to the Issuer under this Agreement and has properly completed and executed the draft in strict accordance with the terms of the Letter of Credit. 
Other Provisions: 
20. Measure of damages. 
The measure of damages for breach of this Agreement by the Subdivider is the reasonable cost of completing the Improvements in conformance with the City's requirements, procedures, and specifications. For Improvements upon which construction has not begun, the estimated cost of the Improvements shown on Exhibit B will be prima facie evidence of the minimum cost of completion; however, neither that amount or the amount of the Letter of Credit establishes the maximum amount of the Subdivider's liability. 
21. Remedies. 
The remedies available to the City, the Subdivider, and Issuer under this Agreement and the laws of Texas are cumulative in nature. 
22. Provisions for the benefit of issuer. 
The provisions of Paragraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 36 of this Agreement for the benefit of the Issuer may not be modified, released, diminished, or impaired by the parties without the prior written consent of the Issuer. 
23. Third party rights. 
No person or entity who or which is not a party to this Agreement shall have any right of action under this Agreement, nor shall any such person or entity other than the City (including without limitation a trustee in bankruptcy) have any interest in or claim to funds drawn on the Letter of Credit and held in escrow by the City in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Issuer shall have a right of action to enforce any provision of this Agreement where the Issuer is specifically named as a beneficiary of such provision pursuant to Paragraph 22. 
24. Indemnification. 
The Subdivider hereby expressly agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless from and against all claims, demands, costs, and liability of every kind and nature, including reasonable attorney's fees for the defense of such claims and demands, arising from any breach on the part of Subdivider of any provision in this Agreement, or from any act or negligence of Subdivider or Subdivider's agents, contractors, employees, tenants, or licensees in the construction of the Improvements. The Subdivider further agrees to aid and defend the City if the City is named as a defendant in an action arising from any breach on the part of Subdivider of any provision in this Agreement, or from any act of negligence of Subdivider or Subdivider's agents, contractors, employees, tenants, or licensees in the construction of the Improvements, except where such suit is brought by the Subdivider. The Subdivider is not an employee or agent of the City. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Subdivider does not agree to indemnify and hold the City harmless from any claims, demands, costs, or liabilities arising from any act or negligence of the City, its agents, contractors, employees, tenants, or licensees. 
25. No waiver. 
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be deemed or constitute a waiver of any other provision, nor will it be deemed or constitute continuing waiver unless expressly provided for by a written amendment to this Agreement; nor will the waiver of any default under this Agreement be deemed a waiver of any subsequent defaults of the same type. The failure at any time to enforce this Agreement or covenant by the City, the Subdivider, or the Issuer, their heirs, successors or assigns, whether any violations thereof are known or not, shall not constitute a waiver or estoppel of the right to do so. 
26. Attorney's fees. 
Should either party or the Issuer, to the extent Issuer is named as specific beneficiary, be required to resort to litigation to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party, plaintiff or defendant, shall be entitled to recover its costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and expert witness fees, from the other party. If the court awards relief to both parties, each will bear its own costs in their entirety. 
27. Assignability. 
The benefits and burdens of this Agreement are personal obligations of the Subdivider and also are binding on the heirs, successors, and assigns of the Subdivider. The Subdivider's obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned without the express written approval of the City. The City's written approval may not be withheld if the Subdivider's assignee explicitly assumes all obligations of the Subdivider under this Agreement and has posted the required security. The City agrees to release or reduce, as appropriate, the Letter of Credit provided by the Subdivider if it accepts substitute security for all or any portion of the Improvements. The City, in its sole discretion, may assign some or all of its rights under this Agreement, and any such assignment shall be effective upon notice to the Subdivider and the Issuer. 
28. Expiration. 
This Agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the approval of the proposed final plat of the Subdivision or if the Subdivision is vacated by the Subdivider. 
29. Notice.

30. Severability. 
If any part, term, or provision of this Agreement is held by the courts to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability shall not affect the validity of any other part, term, or provision, and the rights of the parities will be construed as if the part, term, or provision was never part of this Agreement. 
31. Personal jurisdiction and venue. 
Personal jurisdiction and venue for any civil action commenced by either party to this Agreement or the Issuer, whether arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the Letter of Credit, will be deemed to be proper only if such action is commenced in District Court for Cameron County, Texas, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Brownsville Division.

Sec. 338-109. - Indemnity of city. 
(a)  Any permit, license, or agreement accepting rights under this article automatically contains the indemnity contained in this section. 
(b) These definitions apply to the indemnity provisions of this section: 
    Indemnified claims mean all loss, cost, liability, or expense, directly or indirectly arising out of acts or omissions of any person other than an indemnitee that give rise to assertions of indemnitee liability under this section, whether or not the person is a party to this agreement. Indemnified claims include attorneys' fees and court costs and include claims arising from property damage and from personal or bodily injury, including death. 
    Indemnitees mean the City of Brownsville its elected officials, officers, employees, agents, and other representatives, collectively, against whom an indemnified claim has been asserted. 
    Indemnitor means petitioner. 
(c)  Indemnitor must indemnify indemnitees, individually and collectively, from all indemnified claims. 
(d)  If indemnitor and one or more indemnitees are finally adjudged to be jointly liable for indemnified claim, indemnitor need not further indemnify the so-adjudged indemnitees from liability arising from the indemnitees' adjudicated share of liability. But despite allegations of indemnitee negligence, indemnitor must nevertheless defend all indemnitees until final adjudication. Indemnitor may not recover sums previously spent defending or otherwise indemnifying the indemnitee who has been adjudged to be negligent and must continue to indemnify other indemnitees. 
(e)  There are no third-party beneficiaries of this indemnity other than the category of people and entities included within the definition of indemnitees. 
(f)  Indemnitor must promptly advise the city in writing of any indemnified claim and must, at its own cost, investigate and defend the indemnified claim. Whether or not the city is an indemnitee as to a particular indemnified claim, the city may require indemnitor to replace the counsel indemnitor has hired to defend indemnitees. The city may also require indemnitor to hire specific-named counsel for so long as the named counsel's hourly rates do not exceed the usual and customary charges for counsel handling sophisticated and complex litigation in the locale where the suit is pending. No such actions release or impair indemnitor's obligations under this indemnity paragraph, including its obligation to pay for the counsel selected by city. Regardless of who selects the counsel, the counsel's clients are indemnitees, not indemnitor. 
(g)  In addition to the indemnity required under this section, each indemnitee may, at its own expense, participate in its defense by counsel of its choosing without relieving or impairing indemnitor's obligations under this indemnity paragraph. 
(h)  Indemnitor may not settle any indemnified claim without the consent of the city, whether or not the city is an indemnitee as to the particular indemnified claim, unless (A) the settlement will be fully funded by indemnitor and (B) the proposed settlement does not contain an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any indemnitee. The city's withholding its consent as allowed in the preceding sentence does not release or impair indemnitor's obligations of this indemnity paragraph. Even if the city is not an indemnitee as to a particular indemnified claim, indemnitor must give city at least 20 days' advance written notice of the details of a proposed settlement before it becomes binding. Any settlement purporting to bind an indemnitee must first be approved by city council. 
(i)  Nothing in this section waives governmental immunity or other defenses of indemnitees under applicable law. 
(j)  If, for whatever reason, a court refuses to enforce this indemnity as written, and only in that case, the parties must contribute to any indemnified claim five percent by the indemnitees and 95 percent by the indemnitor. Indemnitor need look only to the city for indemnitees' five percent if the city is an indemnified party as to a particular indemnified claim. 
(k)  This section controls whether or not petitioner's agreement with the city so provides. This section controls even if the agreement provides otherwise, unless an ordinance expressly states that city council intends to override this section as to the particular use by the particular petitioner. 
(l)  Entities that may not lawfully grant indemnities or may not lawfully be required to do so by the city do not grant the indemnity provided for in this section by accepting rights under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2018-1387-C, pt. I, 5-1-2018) 
Sec. 338-110. - Disclaimers. 
(a)  All other provisions of chapter 338 of the City Code of Brownsville, Texas, shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect unless expressly amended by this article. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to authorize the installation of macro wireless towers and related equipment and facilities, nor the installation on poles of wireless equipment and facilities designed for macro wireless towers. 
(c)  The use of rights-of-way under this article does not include a license to install and operate wires and facilities to provide landline broadband backhaul transmission service, whether provided by a third-party provider, applicant, or a corporate affiliate of applicant. Any entity that provides landline broadband backhaul transmission service must have independent legal authorization to use public rights-of-way outside this article. 
(d)  Should any article, section, part, paragraph, sentence, phrase, clause, or word of this article, for any reason be held illegal, inoperative, or invalid, or if any exception to or limitation upon any general provision herein contained be held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective, the remainder shall, nevertheless, stand effective and valid as if it had been enacted and ordained without the portion held to be unconstitutional or invalid or ineffective. 
(e)  Should V.T.C.A., Chapter 284 be held unconstitutional as a result of City of Brownsville, et al. v. State of Texas, et al., No. D-1-GN17-004766, 353rd Dist. Ct. Travis County , after any permit or permits have been issued by operation of V.T.C.A., Chapter 284, any entity that has received such a permit will be responsible for the removal or modification of any installed node(s) and/or pole(s) found by the City to be inconsistent with any applicable municipal land use regulations. Also, any entity receiving a permit under V.T.C.A., Chapter 284 will be obligated to pay just compensation for the use of public right-of-way should that statute be held to be void. 
(f)  The publishers of the City Code of Brownsville, Texas are authorized to amend said Code to reflect the changes adopted herein and to correct typographical errors and to index, format and number paragraphs to conform to the existing code.

Sec. 348-962. - Intent. 
    This section includes a statement of intent, indicating the nature of the special and substantial public interest involved and the objectives to be promoted by special standards and/or procedures inside each overlay district. 
(11)  The O11 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961(a); 
b.  Provide temporary regulations pending determination of new public policy for public or private development inside such district when there is an overriding public necessity justifying such interim district; and 
c.  Ensure that such development is in accord with established public policy and will not have an adverse effect on the general welfare. 
(21)  The O21 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961(a); and 
b.  Encourage mixed-use development or increased flexibility by making the zoning cumulative and thereby allowing certain uses which would not ordinarily be allowed in the base zoning classification. 
(31)  The O31 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961(a); and 
b.  Prohibit new development involving the uses listed in section 348-1031 (1) and (2) where such development would be inappropriate due to one or more factors such as the following: 
1.  Location inside a floodprone area. 
2.  Proximity to existing or proposed hazardous-cargo transportation route. 
3.  Proximity to existing or proposed incompatible land use such as industrial park, wastewater treatment facility, or airport. 
4.  Proximity to existing or proposed aircraft flight path. 
(32)  The O32 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961(a); and 
b.  Prohibit new development involving the uses listed in section 348-1032 (1) and (2) where such development would be inappropriate due to one or more factors such as the following: 
1.  Location inside a floodprone area. 
2.  Proximity to existing or proposed hazardous-cargo transportation route. 
3.  Proximity to existing or proposed incompatible land use such as industrial park, wastewater treatment facility, or airport. 
4.  Proximity to existing or proposed aircraft flight path. 
(33)  The O33 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961 (a); and 
b.  Discourage certain mixed-use development by allowing fewer uses than would ordinarily be allowed in the base zoning classification. 
(41)  The O41 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961(a); and 
b.  Encourage three-story residential buildings. 
(51)  The O51 overlay district is intended to: 
a.  Be consistent with section 348-961(a); and 
b.  Encourage tourism.

(71)  The O71 (resaca) overlay district is intended to help protect the quality of life in and near those resacas that are particularly sensitive to development, especially where there is a potential for uses which may not be entirely compatible with each other. 
(91)  The O91 (limited-rezone) overlay district is intended to discourage the frequent filing of rezoning applications in areas where the official zoning atlas reflects a well-established zoning trend/policy. 
(93)  The O93 (limited-specific-use) overlay district is intended to discourage the frequent filing of specific-use-ordinance applications in areas where the official zoning atlas reflects a well-established zoning trend/policy. 
(100)  The O100 overlay district is intended to provide additional accommodations in terms of professional office use within its boundaries. 
(ENT)  The ENT overlay district is intended to promote the revitalization of downtown Brownsville by designating a downtown entertainment overlay district and encouraging the development of entertainment facilities or venues.

Sec. 348-1411. - Purpose. 
(a)  This section provides for certain uses that, because of their unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent land uses, are not permitted in certain zoning districts as a matter of right but which may, under the right set of circumstances and conditions, be acceptable in certain specific locations. These uses shall be permitted only through the issuance of a specific use permit by the city commission after ensuring that the use can be appropriately accommodated on the specific property and that it meets the area district requirements; that it can be constructed and operated in a manner which is compatible with the surrounding land uses and overall character of the community; and that the public interest, health, safety, and general welfare will be promoted. 
(b)  No inherent right exists to receive a specific use permit. Such permit must be approved under a specific set of circumstances and conditions. Further, each application and situation is unique. Mere compliance with the generally applicable requirements may not be sufficient to obtain approval, and additional measures and conditions may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. Specific use permits are authorized by V.T.C.A. Local Government Code §§ 211.005 through 211.007. 
(Ord. No. 2016-235.85, § pt. 2, 8-16-2016) 
Sec. 348-1412. - Definition. 
    The provisions of this section apply to any application for approval of a specific use permit, excluding all permits established in chapter 300, article III, division 2 of this Code. Specific or conditional uses are those uses generally compatible with the land uses permitted by right in a zoning district, but that require individual review of their location, design and configuration; imposition of conditions to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location; and compliance with the area district requirements within a given zoning district. A specific use permit shall be required for all conditional uses as established in article IV of this chapter, with the exception of conditional uses for which conditions are already established under the applicable use district and required for approval. Further, all specific use permits shall be issued to the owner and abide by the term limits established in section 348-1421. Specific use permits shall not run with the land unless they meet the term limits established in section 348-1421.

Sec. 348-1489. - Statement of purpose. 
    The City of Brownsville has had ordinances written and passed to protect and utilize the city's historic resources, since 1971 With the adoption of the city's comprehensive plan in 2009, the city reaffirmed its commitment to these resources. The plan indicates the city should develop a comprehensive preservation plan to aid in the protection and redevelopment of historic properties and establish goals and strategies for preservation, rehabilitation, economic development and tourism expansion. 
    The implementation of the objectives of this article are a critical part of the city's long-term strategic objectives. The economic, environmental, and downtown portions as well as the urban design smart growth principles that underlie the comprehensive plan all rely on the resiliency and strength of the Historic District (HD); this connection cannot be overstated. 
    The following goals, objectives and policies have largely been a part of the ordinances since their inception and are re-affirmed here: 
(a)  The declaration that as a matter of public policy the protection, enhancement, preservation, rehabilitation, and use of the city's historic resources is a public necessity and required in the interest of the culture, education, prosperity, and general welfare of the people of the city; and 
(b)  The provision of long-term regulations for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the city's historic resources and districts that represent or reflect elements of the city's cultural, economic, political, social, and architectural history; and 
(c)  The assurance that development and regulation is in accord with established public policy and will protect and enhance the city's historical architectural resources and attractions for the benefit of residents, tourists, and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business and industry to strengthen the economy of the city; and 
(d)  The promotion of the use of historic districts and use of the city's historic resources for the education, pleasure, and welfare of the people of the city; and 
(e)  The protection, enhancement, and perpetuation of historic architectural resources which represent or reflect distinctive and important elements of the city, the state, and the Rio Grande Valley in terms of architectural, archeological, cultural, social, economic, ethnic, and political history and develop appropriate settings for such places; and 
(f)  To safeguard the city's historic and cultural heritage as embodied and reflected in historic landmarks and designated historic resources by appropriate regulations; and 
(g)  To stabilize and improve property values in such locations; and 
(h)  To foster knowledge of and civic pride in the beauty and accomplishments of the city's past; and 
(i)  To strengthen the economy of the city; and 
(j)  To strengthen civic pride through neighborhood preservation; and 
(k)  Promote the use of historic resources for the culture, prosperity, education, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the city and visitors to the city; and 
(l)  To establish the highest urban design standards for public property including public buildings and public spaces in the HD so the public commitment to quality design and preservation encourages and inspires by example a corresponding commitment by the private sector.

Sec. 348-1502. - Ad valorem tax incentives and the historic preservation plan. 
    The city has had tax incentives for historic buildings in place since the early 1980s. These tax incentives have proven effective in encouraging historic preservation. The incentives have been supported by the various taxing entities that access taxes on property owners in the HD. The existence of this component of the historic preservation plan encourages socio-economic diversity and stabilizes and lifts property values. 
(a)  Ad valorem tax component of the historic preservation plan. Taxable designated historic resources may qualify for ad valorem property tax relief as described in section 94-57 of this Code. 
(b)  Listing in the historic preservation plan. The recipients of the tax relief described in section 94-57 are determined annually by listing in the ad valorem component of the city's historic preservation plan.

(2)  The HPDRB may direct the HPO to request that the owner of a designated historic resource keep and provide the HPDRB on an annual basis accurate information, including receipts, cancelled checks, invoices, and other relevant information, detailing the record of expenditures towards the preservation, restoration, and/or objects at the designated historic resource, for the HPDRB. 
(3)  If the HPO finds that any property (appears to be out of compliance this chapter) then the HPO shall report to the HPDRB on the condition of said property. HPDRB shall make a finding of compliance or noncompliance and direct the HPO to notify the owner of noncompliance and specify a compliance period not to exceed 60 days. The monitoring of all designated historic resources by the HPO and the HPDRB shall take place on a regular basis. The HPO shall notify the owner of record of any historic resource with an object or a structure in need of repair and make recommendations to the property owner about how to accomplish such maintenance and repair in a proper and efficient manner. 
(4)  If the HPO finds that the historic resource is structurally unsound or in imminent danger of becoming structurally unsound he or she shall notify the owner of record by certified mail of such facts and specify the needed repairs and/or maintenance to remedy these conditions and provide a date upon which such repairs must be completed, not to exceed 60 days. Such written notification shall extend to and include other work items if there are reasonable grounds to indicate that the resource is undergoing widespread deterioration and, thus, architectural detailing and elements of the resource are being destroyed. 
(5)  If necessary repairs to the designated historic resource are not completed pursuant to the needed repairs specified to the owner, the HPO shall report on conditions at the resource to the HPDRB and recommend that that the resource be deleted (blocked) from inclusion in the ad valorem taxation component of the historic preservation plan. 
(6)  If the HPDRB agrees with the recommendation of the HPO, then the HPDRB shall have the authority to amend the current historic preservation plan and remove said resource from the ad valorem tax incentive list. 
(7)  Any owner of a historic resource blocked from participation in the ad valorem taxation component of the historic preservation plan adopted by the city commission pursuant to this section shall still have to comply with all other subsections of this section, including prohibitions against demolition by neglect (section 348-1526) and demolition of such a resource without first obtaining valid permission from the city.

Sec. 348-1520. - Certificates of appropriateness (COA). 
(a)  Definition and guidelines for granting. 
(1)  The purpose of a certificate of appropriateness (COA) is to help maintain, return or enhance the lost or diminished architectural significance of Brownsville's tangible past. A COA is required for any project requiring a building permit that is located in the HD or that pertains to a locally-designated landmark located anywhere in the city. This includes alterations, additions, demolitions, or relocations within the HD or new construction in the HD. 
(2)  If a COA is granted, it may be granted with provisions and conditions. Conceptual approval may be granted for general design ideas and principles (such as scale and setback). 
(3)  In previous ordinance versions this was also referred to as a Class A permit (section 348-1701) and is described as the required administrative permit for alterations of an historic resource. 
(b)  Grounds for the granting. The granting of a COA shall be under the guidelines of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, guidelines adopted by the city commission, and the guidelines contained herein, the respective knowledge of the HPDRB and it shall be the burden of the owner to so prove that any alteration is in compliance with such standards. The following guidelines are inserted here as a reference: 
(1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or resource and its environment or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
(2)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
(3)  All buildings, structures, objects and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
(4)  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, object or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
(5)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object, or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
(6)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. If replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence, rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
(7)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(8)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project. 
(9)  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
(10)  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
(c)  Compliance with permit. A person shall not alter a local landmark or a site within the city limits without complying with the COA. The applicant may consult with the planning department, the HPO, or the HPDRB before submitting an application and during the review process. 
(d)  Application. Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a COA under this division, the owner shall file an application for a certificate with the HPO. The application should be accompanied by: 
(1)  Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; 
(2)  Address of the property if different from owner's address; 
(3)  Elevation drawings of the proposed changes, including site plan, sections and floor plans if applicable; 
(4)  Samples and specific description of materials to be used; 
(5)  If the proposal includes signs or lettering, a scale drawing showing the type of lettering to be used, all dimensions and colors, a description of materials to be used, method of illumination if any, and a plan showing the sign's location on the property; and 
(6)  Any other information which the HPO may deem necessary in order to visualize the proposed work; 
(e)  Role of the HPO. It is the role of the HPO to assist whenever possible any citizen of Brownsville in making decisions, designing and in general complying with the historic preservation ordinances and guidelines.

Sec. 348-1523. - Relocation of a structure into or out of the historic district. 
(a)  No development that requires the relocation of a historic building, object, or structure that is located to be located in or removed from the HD shall occur until both a COA has been granted and all other applicable sections of the city Code have been met. 
(b)  In considering whether to recommend approval or disapproval of a certificate application to relocate a building, object or structure into or out of the HD, the HPDRB shall be guided by the following considerations: 
(1)  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting; 
(2)  Whether there are definite plans for the area that will be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be; 
(3)  Whether the building, structure, or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; 
(4)  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, object, or structure. 
(5)  Balancing the contribution of the property to the character of the HD with the special merit of the application.

(Ord. No. 2015-1606, 12-1-2015) 
Sec. 348-1524. - Demolition. 
(a)  Intention of this section. This article is intended to provide long-term regulation for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the city's historic sites, historic resources and historic clusters that represent elements of the city's cultural, economic, political, social, and architectural history, inside the HD. 
    Since 1971 the city has had preservation ordinances to ensure that development occurs in accord with established public policy and that it will protect and enhance the city's historic/architectural resources for the benefit of residents, tourists, and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business and industry, strengthening the economy of the city. 
    Demolition of an historic structure constitutes an irreplaceable loss to the quality and character of the city. Accordingly, these procedures provide criteria to prevent unnecessary damage to the quality and character of the city's historic district character while, at the same time, balancing these interests against the property rights of landowners. 
    This section is also meant to ensure that the city's historic preservation ordinances effectively safeguard areas and sites of historical significance and to ensure that: 
(1)  These resources are not seriously endangered by ill-advised repairs and shoddy construction of inferior quality and appearance and by wholesale alterations that are incompatible with their preservation and enjoyment; 
(2)  These areas and sites are not diminished by relocation or demolition of designated historic resources which destroy or lessen the architectural context of the district or clusters of structures within the district; and 
(3)  The owners of historic resources shall not be denied reasonable use of their property. 
(b)  These ordinances are meant to promote city's heritage and are designed for the education, pleasure, and welfare of the citizens. One or more of the following characteristics may be of significance when considering demolitions. 
(1)  Character, interest or value as part of the historic development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the city, state, or county. 
(2)  Location as the site of a significant historic event. 
(3)  Identification with a person who significantly contributed to the cultural and development of the city. 
(4)  Contribution to the city's economic, social, or historical context 
(5)  Portrayal of the environment of a group of people in an era of history characterized by a distinctive architectural style. 
(6)  Embodiment of distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or specimen. 
(7)  Identification as the work of an architect or master builder whose individual work has influenced the development of the city. 
(8)  Embodiment of elements of architectural design, detail, materials or craftsmanship which represent a significant architectural innovation. 
(9)  Relationship to other distinctive buildings, sites, or areas which are eligible for preservation according to a plan based on historic, cultural, or architectural motif. 
(10)  Unique location of singular physical characteristics representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood, community or the city. 
(11)  Archaeological value in that it has produced or can be expected to produce data affecting theories of historic or prehistoric interest. 
(c)  Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to any application for demolition in the HD. No development that constitutes the demolition or partial demolition, substantial alteration, or relocation of a building, object, or structure in the HD shall occur until a COA for demolition has been approved and a permit therefor has been granted by the buildings department and all other applicable sections of the city Code and state law have been met. 
(1)  Historic resource. No certificate shall be issued for demolition of an historic resource as defined in section 348-1502, unless the applicant demonstrates clear and convincing evidence supporting an unreasonable economic hardship on the applicant. If an applicant fails to prove unreasonable economic hardship, the applicant may provide to the HPDRB additional information regarding loss of integrity and/or significance as provided in subsection (c) in order to receive an HPDRB recommendation for a certificate for demolition. 
(2)  Public safety hazards and emergency securing measures. Except in cases of imminent danger to public safety, health, or welfare. No federal, state or local resource nor any structure located within the historic district may be demolished in whole or in part as a hazard to public safety, or for any reason whatsoever until the HPO has been notified by the appropriate municipal official that an order for such demolition is being prepared, and the HPDRB has had 60 days to have an opportunity to discuss with city officials the feasibility of emergency measures to secure the structure in such a manner as to preclude the possibility of injury to the public. If there is any city ordinance that conflicts with this article, this article shall take precedence. 
(d)  Unreasonable economic hardship. 
(1)  Generally. The HPDRB shall be guided in its decision to grant or deny a demolition permit for a given structure in the HD by balancing the historic, architectural, cultural and/or archaeological value of the site against the merit of the proposed replacement project and its potential to contribute to the HD. The HPDRB shall not consider or be persuaded to find unreasonable economic hardship based on the presentation of circumstances or items that are not unique to the property in question (i.e., the current economy). 
(2)  Burden of proof. When a claim of unreasonable economic hardship is made, the owner must provide evidence that: 
a.  The owner cannot make reasonable beneficial use of or realize a reasonable rate of return on a structure or site, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible, unless the proposed demolition or relocation is allowed; 
b.  The structure and property cannot be reasonably adapted for any other feasible use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable rate of return; and 
c.  The owner has failed to find a purchaser or tenant for the property during the previous two years, despite having listed the property on the MLS, or for sale by owner with proof of advertising and or other substantive proof of effort to sell the property during that period. 
d.  The evidence of unreasonable economic hardship introduced by the owner may, where applicable, include proof that the owner's affirmative obligations to maintain the structure or property make it impossible for the owner to realize a reasonable rate of return on the structure or property. 
(3)  Criteria. The public benefits obtained from retaining the cultural resource must be analyzed and duly considered by the HPDRB. 
As evidence that an unreasonable economic hardship exists, the owner may submit the following information to the HPDRB by affidavit: 
a.  For all structures and property: 
i.  The past and current use of the structures and property; 
ii.  The name and legal status (e.g., partnership, corporation) of the owners; 
iii.  The original purchase price of the structures and property; 
iv.  The assessed value of the structures and property according to the two most recent tax assessments; 
v.  The amount of real estate taxes on the structures and property for the previous two years; 
vi.  The date of purchase or other acquisition of the structures and property; 
vii.  Principal balance and interest rate on current mortgage and the annual debt service on the structures and property, if any, for the previous two years; 
viii.  All appraisals obtained by the owner or applicant within the previous two years in connection with the owner's purchase, financing or ownership of the structures and property; 
ix.  Any listing of the structures and property for sale or rent price asked and offers received; 
x.  Any consideration given by the owner to profitable adaptive uses for the structures and property; 
xi.  Any replacement construction plans for proposed improvements on the site; 
xii.  Financial proof of the owner's ability to complete any replacement project on the site, which may include but not be limited to a performance bond, a letter of credit, a trust for completion of improvements, or a letter of commitment from a financial institution; and 
xiii.  The current fair market value of the structure and property as determined by a qualified appraiser. 
xiv.  Any property tax exemptions claimed in the past five years. 
b.  For income-producing structures and property: 
i.  Annual gross income from the structure and property for the previous two years; 
ii.  Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years; and 
iii.  Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years. 
c.  In the event that the HPDRB determines that any additional information described above is necessary in order to evaluate whether an unreasonable economic hardship exists, the HPDRB shall notify the owner. Failure by the owner to submit such information to the HPDRB within 15 days after receipt of such notice, which time may be extended by the HPDRB, may be grounds for denial of the owner's claim of unreasonable economic hardship. 
When a low-income resident homeowner is unable to meet the requirements set forth in this section, then the HPDRB, at its own discretion, may waive some or all of the requested information and/or request substitute information that an indigent resident homeowner may obtain without incurring any costs. If the HPDRB cannot make a determination based on information submitted and an appraisal has not been provided, then the HPDRB may request that an appraisal be made by the city. 
(e)  Loss of significance. An applicant may provide to the HPDRB information which may show a loss of significance in regards to the subject of the application in order to receive HPDRB of approval of the demolition. 
    If, based on the evidence presented, the HPDRB finds that the structure or property is no longer historically, culturally, architecturally or archeologically significant it may make a recommendation for approval of the demolition. In making this determination, the HPDRB must find that the owner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the structure or property has undergone significant and irreversible changes which have caused it to lose the historic, cultural, architectural or archeological significance, qualities or features which qualified the structure or property for such designation. Additionally, the HPDRB must find that such changes were not caused either directly or indirectly by the owner, and were not due to intentional or negligent destruction or a lack of maintenance rising to the level of a demolition by neglect. 
    The HPDRB shall not consider or be persuaded to find loss of significance based on the presentation of circumstances or items that are not unique to the property in question (i.e., the current economic climate). 
    For property located within a historic district, the HPDRB shall be guided in its decision by balancing the contribution of the property to the character of the HD with the special merit of the proposed replacement project. 
(f)  Documentation and strategy. 
(1)  Applicants that have received a COA regarding demolition may be required to document buildings, objects, sites or structures which are intended to be demolished with photographs and provide them to the HPO. 
(2)  Applicants may be required to prepare for the HPO a salvage strategy for reuse of building materials deemed valuable by the HPO for other preservation and restoration activities. 
(3)  Applicants that have received an approval of a COA regarding demolition shall be permitted to receive a demolition permit without additional board action on demolition, following the board's recommendation of a certificate for new construction. Permits for demolition and construction shall be issued simultaneously if requirements for new construction are met, and the property owner provides financial proof of his ability to complete the project. 
(4)  When the board recommends approval of a certificate for buildings, objects, sites, structures designated as historic, or for resources in the historic district, permits shall not be issued until all plans for the site have received approval from all appropriate city boards, commissions, departments and agencies. Permits for parking lots shall not be issued, nor shall an applicant be allowed to operate a parking lot on such property, unless such parking lot plan was approved as a replacement element for the demolished object or structure. 
(g)  Issuance of permit. When the board recommends approval of a COA regarding demolition of buildings, objects, sites, or structures in historic districts or historic sites that have been determined to be contributing, permits shall not be issued until all plans for the site have received approval from all appropriate city boards, commissions, departments and agencies. Once the replacement plans are approved a fee shall be assessed for the demolition based on the approved replacement plan square footage. The fee must be paid in full prior to issuance of any permits and shall be deposited into a city account directed by the HPO for the benefit and or rehabilitation of local historic resources including the prevention of demolition by neglect (section 348-1523(c)(3)). 
Fees shall be as follows and are in addition to any fees charged by the building department: 
0-2,500 square feet = $1,500.00 
2,501-10,000 square feet = $4,000.00 
10,001-25,000 square feet = $10,000.00 
25,001-50,000 square feet = $20,000.00 
Over 50,000 square feet = $30,000.00 
(h)  The HPO may use administrative approval for applications for demolition permits for non-contributing minor outbuildings within the HD such as carports, detached garages, sheds, and greenhouses determined by the HPO to not possess historical or architectural significance either as a stand-alone building or structure, or as part of a complex of buildings or structures on the site.

(Ord. No. 2015-1606, 12-1-2015) 
Secs. 348-1528-348-1530. - Reserved. 
Sec. 348-1531. - Signs and billboards. 
    The intent of this section is to regulate all exterior signs and permanent interior window signs placed for exterior observance; to establish limitations on signs to ensure that they are appropriate to the neighborhood, building or use to which they are meant and are adequate, but not excessive, for their intended purpose as a means of communication without adverse impact on the visual character of the area; to ensure that signs are compatible with their surroundings; to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment of the historic districts; to minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property; to avoid visual clutter that is potentially harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety, property values, and community appearance; and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations. The historic design guidelines are intended to supplement signage and billboard regulations contained in this article and chapter 328 of the city Code. The historic design guidelines should be reviewed and applied in conjunction with this chapter and chapter 328 of the city Code, however, in the case of a conflict the more strict regulation or guideline shall control unless a specific exception has been granted by the city commission. In an effort to promote both historic preservation and environmental awareness, applicants are encouraged to submit ideas to the office of historic preservation and to seek consultation therein. 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  All signage within the HD or on an historic resource shall conform to all city codes and must have approval of the HPO prior to installation. Permits must be obtained following issuance of a COA. No signs shall be painted, constructed, erected, remodeled, refaced, relocated, expanded or otherwise altered until it has been approved and a permit has been obtained from the HPO. 
(2)  Signs should respect and respond to the historic character and period being preserved. 
(3)  The name of a business, or information pertaining to a business, may be changed through the administrative approval process if the sign conforms to the provisions of this section, and if the color, size, and style of lettering, and illumination of the sign remain the same. 
(4)  Special consideration should be given to the character of the sign itself proposed in the application, and whether the proposed sign has inherently historic characteristics which may fall outside of the guidelines presented below but which would contribute to the HD, landmark or area for which it is being proposed. Additionally, when reviewing applications for signage the HPO and the HPDRB shall consider the visual impact on nearby historic resources. 
(5)  Memorials, markers, naming rights of public property and recognition of charitable donations given to the city, as well as all non-profits are covered by this article. 
(b)  Sign definitions. Most sign definitions may be found in Sec. 328-7; additionally: sign means any object, device, display, structure, description, figure, painting, drawing, message, plaque, placard, poster, or thing or any part thereof, situated outdoors or indoors, that is designed or used to advertise, inform, identify, display, direct, or attract attention to anything by any means, including words, letters, figures, design, symbols, fixtures, colors, illumination or projected images. The foregoing enumeration of signs shall not be considered to be exclusive. The term "sign" shall include all other devices or structures as may reasonably be included under it; whether attached or unattached. 
(c)  Proportion of signs. For all signage, width and height must be in proportion to the facade, respecting the size, scale and mass of the facade, building height, and rhythms and sizes of window and door openings. The building facade shall be considered as part of an overall sign program and the sign shall be subordinate to the overall building composition. Additionally, signs should respect and respond to the character and/or period of the area in which they are being placed. As a general rule of thumb, the sign should not exceed one square foot of signage per linear foot of building frontage. In this case, corner buildings would count total linear feet fronting each street. 
(d)  Number and size of signs. 
(1)  Number and size. The HPDRB shall be guided in its decisions by the total number of businesses or services per building and the percentage of floor space occupied by each business or service. Notwithstanding the above, signs may not exceed the maximum size and height limitation for signage contained in chapter 328. The applicant is strongly advised to coordinate his signage plan with signage plans of other building tenants. It is also recommended that the building owner or their agent develop a master signage plan or signage guidelines for the total building or property. If a property has an approved master signage plan on file with the office of historic preservation, applications for signage may be approved administratively at the discretion of the HPO provided that they comply with such master signage plan. 
(2)  Channel letter signs. For channel letter signs, the sign area shall be the smallest rectangle that will encompass the limits of the writing, including spaces between the letters. Each advertising message shall be considered separately. 
(3)  Building identification signs. An additional building identification sign may be placed on a building with multiple tenants, if the building name is not the same as the business(s) housed within and such sign is approved as provided for in this section. This type of sign is to identify a building as a destination and shall not be included in the total allowable signage area. 
(e)  Allowable signs not included in the total signage area. 
(1)  Information signs of a public or quasi-public nature identifying or locating a hospital, public building, college, parking area, historic area or district, major tourist attraction or similar public or quasi-public activity; and also including signs identifying restrooms or other facilities relating to such places or activities. Signs approved under this category shall not be included in the total allowable signage per structure. 
(2)  Incidental signs, including signs designating business hours, decals, street numbers, credit card acceptance and the like provided that the signs are not freestanding, the total of all such signs shall not exceed four square feet for each business, and the signs are non-illuminated. 
Incidental signs shall not be included in the total allowable signage per structure. 
(f)  Pedestrian menu boards and sandwich boards. Pedestrian menu boards shall not exceed two square feet. Notwithstanding provisions of chapter 328, sandwich boards are permitted in the HD as on premises signs provided permitting requirements of chapter 328 are met. Permanently displayed menus may be properly installed inside the business' window or in an approved wall-mounted or freestanding display case adjacent to the business entrance. The name of the establishment may not be displayed on the menu board if the business has other signage installed on the premises. It is permissible for the name of the restaurant to be placed on the actual menu. The established logo of a business is considered a sign. All items listed on a menu board must be placed within the border of the menu board or within the display case. There may be no more than one pedestrian menu board per establishment unless there are two primary entrances to a building on different facades, in which case a pedestrian menu board for each entrance may be approved. 
(g)  Noncommercial speech signs. Noncommercial speech signs including but not limited to public service announcements may be erected in the HD following approval provided all regulations in this article are met. The maximum size of a noncommercial speech sign shall be eight square feet, and it shall not be illuminated. 
(h)  Prohibited signs. The following types of signs shall be prohibited within the HD. However, any sign designated as a contributing sign or structure by the HPO shall not be prohibited unless or until such designation is revoked. 
(1)  Billboards, junior billboards, portable signs, and advertising benches shall not be permitted within the HD; 
(2)  Any sign placed upon a building, object, site, or structure in any manner so as to disfigure, damage, or conceal any window opening, door, or significant architectural feature or detail of any building; 
(3)  Any sign which advertises commercial off-premises businesses, products, activities, services, or events unless otherwise allowed in this article; 
(4)  Any sign which does not identify a business or service within the HD or historic landmark unless otherwise allowed in this article; 
(5)  Any non-contributing sign which is abandoned or damaged beyond 50 percent of its replacement value, including parts of old or unused signs. All remnants such as supports, brackets and braces must also be removed; 
(6)  Any attachment to an already affixed sign which does not meet the provisions of the city Code; 
(7)  Pole signs; 
(8)  Revolving signs or signs with a kinetic component; 
(9)  Any sandwich board which conflicts with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or which disrupts or interferes with pedestrian or other traffic; and 
(10)  Any sign which consists of pennants, ribbons, spinners or other similar moving devices, such as feather flags. 
(11)  Any sign, except official notices and advertisements, which is nailed, tacked, posted or in any other manner attached to any utility pole or structure or supporting wire, cable, or pipe; or to any tree on any street or sidewalk or to public property of any description. 
(12)  Moored balloons or other floating signs that are tethered to the ground or to a structure. 
(13)  Digital and/or LED lit signs, including electronically energized animated signs and changeable signs. When Digital and/or LED lit signs are permitted the HPO may impose additional restrictions on illumination and/or size to ensure that the character of the sign is harmonious with the character of the structure and neighborhood on which it is to be placed. Digital and/or LED lit signs are allowed if they meet at least one of the following requirements: 
a.  Dimmable illuminated signs with and enclosed light source; 
b.  Dimmable illuminated signs with an indirect light source; and 
c.  In cases of natural disaster or emergency. 
(i)  Installation. Signs, posters, decals or advertisements may not be affixed, tacked, nailed, pasted, or taped to any portion of a building, object, resource or structure in a manner that will cause irreversible damage or loss, or is considered inappropriate under any applicable guidelines utilized by the office of historic preservation. 
(j)  Hardship cases. 
(1)  Whenever the location, topography or configuration of any lot is such as will cause a hardship by the limitations placed on the signs permitted by this article due to sight distances, existing vegetation, location of buildings on adjacent lots, and/or the topography of the parcel, approval may be granted to either allow additional signage, or to increase the amount of building mounted sign area by not more than 25 percent. 
(2)  No additional signage shall be approved unless it is found that approval of the proposed application will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the area will not be changed by the granting of additional signage. 
(3)  Any additional signage approval shall be limited to the applicant only, and shall not apply to any future tenant or business. 
(k)  Nonconforming status. Any legally erected sign which, by reason of revisions to this chapter, no longer complies with its provisions, shall be awarded nonconforming status upon review by all necessary city departments. Such permission will not pass to subsequent occupants, owners, lessees, etc., of such premises. 
(l)  Violations. The violations provisions set forth in sections 328-27 through 328-33 of this Code shall apply. The HPO shall have the same authority of the code officers/inspectors to issue citations and stop work orders as set out in sections 328-30 and 328-31. 
(1)  Dilapidated signs. Signs shall be maintained in good working condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance. Signs and components thereof shall be maintained in good repair, free of rust, peeling, flaking, fading, broken or cracked panels, and broken or missing letters. All signs, components, supports and their surroundings shall be kept free of all sign materials, weeds, debris, trash, and other refuse. The HPO and the building department may give written notice to remove or repair, within 30 days, any sign which shows gross neglect or which is dilapidated. Failure to comply shall be considered a violation of this chapter. Additionally, whether the sign has been designated a contributing structure shall be taken into account when evaluating the condition of the sign. 
(2)  Abandoned signs. A sign, including its supporting structure or brackets, shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located when the business which it advertises is no longer on the premises and such sign has been determined to be abandoned. Such sign, if not removed within 30 days from the determination of abandonment by such business shall be considered to be in violation of this chapter, and shall be removed at the owner's expense. This does not include signs that are currently approved as contributing structures.

GMS ANNUAL RATE INCREASE 
2001-2002 
data furnished by 
Department of Labor Bureau of Statistics 
Dallas, TX (214/767-6970) 
COB-GMS contract calls for automatic annual rate increase based on the percentage of annual increase from August 2000 to August 2001 of the "Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners & Clerical Workers (all items); National Average." (CPI-W) 
RATE INCREASE COMPUTATION FORMULA 
CPI (August 2001) minus CPI (August 2000) divided by CPI (August 2000) = percentage of increase. 
ACTUAL FORMULA APPLICATION 2001-2002 INCREASE 
CPI (August 2000) = 169.3 (revised) 
CPI (August 2001) = 173.8 
173.8 minus 169.3 divided by 169.3 = 2.658% rounded to 2.7% 
Formula for Computing 
Additional Landfill Expenses 
Landfill increase times tonnage = Extra Expenses $3.00 times $45,989.97 Tons = $137,969.91  
Formula for Re-Capture 
of 
Additional Landfill Charges 
Pub Income 100% Minus city Franchise  16% Minus PUB billing   3% Net to GMS 81%  
Additional Landfill Charges divided by 81% = Additional Gross Income needed to re-capture Landfill increase 
$137,969.91 divided by 81% = $170,333.22 needed for recapture 
$170,333.22 as percentage of PUB Income = % of increase to rates charged customers. 
$170,333.22 divided by $3,741,830.49 = 4.55 rounded to 4.5% Increase.
