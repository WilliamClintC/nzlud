The purpose of this article is to establish formal procedures for the conduct of city council meetings. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.020 Meeting dates and times.

(1) Regular Meetings. Regular city council meetings are held on the second Tuesday of each month in the city council chambers at Normandy Park City Hall, 801 SW 174th Street, Normandy Park, Washington. Regular meetings start at 7:00 p.m. and will adjourn no later than 10:00 p.m. To continue past this time of adjournment, a majority of the council must concur.

(2) Cancellation. A regular meeting may be canceled by a majority vote of the city council at the previous meeting before said meeting. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.030 Quorum.

At all meetings of the council, a majority of the council (four members, or five members for budget items and appropriations) constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, but a lesser number may adjourn from day to day or until the time of the next regular meeting and may compel the attendance of absent members in such a manner and under such penalties as the city council shall prescribe. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.040 Presiding officer.

(1) Presiding Officer. The presiding officer at all meetings of the council is the mayor, and in the absence of the mayor, the mayor pro tempore will act in that capacity. If both the mayor and mayor pro tempore are absent, the next ranking member shall act in that capacity.

(2) Obligations of Presiding Officer. The presiding officer shall:

(a) Preserve order and decorum in the council chambers;

(b) Observe and enforce all rules adopted by the council;

(c) Decide all questions on order, in accordance with these rules, subject to appeal by any councilmember;

(d) Recognize all questions on order, in accordance with these rules, councilmembers in the order in which they request the floor, giving every councilmember who wishes an opportunity to speak. The presiding officer, as a councilmember, shall have only those rights, and shall be governed in all matters and issues by the same rules and restrictions as other councilmembers; and

(e) From time to time, appoint councilmembers to serve on ad hoc committees. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.050 Council seating.

The presiding officer and six elected councilmembers sit facing the public with the presiding officer seated in the middle. The mayor will determine city council seating arrangements. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.060 Council meeting scheduled on holiday.

In the event a city-recognized holiday falls on the second Tuesday, the council meeting shall be moved to the following day. The city council may, at any time, add or change a meeting date and time by a majority vote of the council and proper notification to the media. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.070 Recording proceedings.

The city clerk shall maintain an account of all proceedings of the council in accordance with the statutory requirements, and proceedings shall be entered into a minute book constituting the official record of the council. Council meeting minutes can be corrected but shall not be revised without a majority affirmative vote of the council at a regularly scheduled council meeting. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.080 Broadcasting.

Regular meetings may be cablecast live on NPTV-21 and via streaming video/audio on the city website. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.090 Meeting order.

(1) Placing Items on the Agenda. An item may be placed on a council meeting agenda, in advance of posting an agenda, by any of the following methods:

(a) By majority vote of the council;

(b) By council consensus;

(c) By any three councilmembers;

(d) By the city manager;

(e) By a council committee; or

(f) By the mayor.

(2) Call to Order. The presiding officer calls the meeting to order.

(3) Roll Call. The city clerk will call the roll and announce the attendance of councilmembers and indicate any councilmember who is not in attendance and whether or not the councilmember has submitted a reason for the absence. An excused absence requires notice to the city clerk prior to 5:00 p.m. on the date of the meeting. A majority vote is required to excuse any councilmember absence.

(4) Pledge of Allegiance. Councilmembers, and at times invited guests, lead the flag salute.

(5) Agenda Item Order. The presiding officer may, with the concurrence of the councilmembers, take agenda items out of order.

(6) Approval of the Agenda. A majority vote is required for approval of the agenda.

(7) Formal Proclamations and Special Presentations.

(a) A proclamation is defined as an official announcement made by either the city council or the mayor. Council proclamations are defined as those noncontroversial events which have a major citywide impact. Council proclamations shall be publicly read at a council meeting, and whenever possible, presented to a representative of the event during the council meeting.

(b) Mayor’s proclamations are defined as those noncontroversial events which are requested by a special interest group. Mayor’s proclamations are signed by the mayor and forwarded to a representative of the event or special interest group.

(c) The mayor and city manager shall determine if a proclamation request is for a council proclamation or a mayor’s proclamation.

(d) Controversy is defined as a dispute, especially a lengthy and public one, between sides holding opposing views.

(e) Special presentations include, but are not limited to, retirements, commendations and recognition by the mayor and city council.

(8) Public Communications.

(a) This is the place on the agenda when the public is invited to speak for approximately three minutes about an issue of concern or interest not already scheduled for public hearing during the meeting. Public communications will not be permitted on pending quasi-judicial matters which will come before the city council later in the same meeting or at a future meeting.

(b) Speakers are requested to complete a “Public Comment Form” which provides their name, address, agency or group represented, and the issue they wish to comment on, and their position on the subject.

(c) Complaints, concerns, or questions are encouraged to be referred to the city manager.

(9) Group Testimony to Council.

(a) Speakers are also requested to complete a “Public Comment Form” which provides their name, address, agency or group represented, the item they wish to testify on, and their position on the subject.

(b) At the appropriate time, speakers are requested by the presiding officer to step up to the podium, give their name and address for the record, and asked to limit their remarks to approximately three minutes. (Council prefers lengthy testimony to be submitted at least a week prior, so council has a chance to fairly consider the comments.) All remarks will be addressed to the council as a whole. Any person making personal, impertinent, or slanderous remarks, or who becomes boisterous, threatening, or personally abusive while addressing the council, may be requested to leave the meeting.

(c) The presiding officer and city manager have the authority to preserve order at all meetings of the council, to cause the removal of any person from any meeting for disorderly conduct and to enforce the rules of the council. The presiding officer and city manager may command assistance of any police officer of the city to enforce all lawful orders to restore order at any meeting. If order cannot be restored, the procedures set forth in the Open Public Meetings Act, RCW 42.30.050, may be used.

(10) Public Hearings, Closed Record Proceedings and Appeals.

(a) The public hearing is a formal opportunity for citizens to give their views for consideration in the legislative or policy decision-making process. In addition, public hearings are required on quasi-judicial actions which determine the legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties.

(b) The following procedures shall be adhered to during hearings on:

(i) Legislative/Information Gathering.

(B) If a speaker purports to speak for an organization, club or others so as to lead council to believe that a number of persons support a position, such person shall state how that position was developed by the group.

(C) Comments should be limited to three minutes for each individual or five minutes if representing the official position of a recognized organization.

(D) The presiding officer may allow additional time for receipt of written testimony when needed.

(E) The city clerk shall be the official timekeeper.

(ii) Quasi-Judicial Hearing Body before Which the Hearing Was Held.

(A) When the city council considers a quasi-judicial matter in a closed record proceeding or appeal, no new evidence may be presented except on matters related to the conflict of interest or appearance of fairness challenge to a councilmember. Oral argument shall be based solely on the record before the planning commission, hearing examiner or other quasi-judicial hearing body before which the hearing was held.

(B) If a quasi-judicial proceeding or appeal is on the agenda, the parties will be informed by the city attorney as to what state law permits for comments.

(C) Quasi-judicial hearings will be conducted in conformance to procedures outlined in the city ordinances such as the Land Use Procedures Code, Chapter 18.150 NPMC.

(D) Presentations will be limited as set forth in subsections (10)(c)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, except that the presiding officer shall ask the rest of the councilmembers if they have any comments or questions before the presenter is excused.

(E) If comments are provided in writing, it is encouraged that such written comments be filed with the city clerk by 1:00 p.m. of the Wednesday preceding the regular meeting. If written comments are given at the meeting, the presenter should provide 11 copies for the council and staff.

(11) Continued Business or Old Business. This part of the agenda consists of those items that were continued or not finished from a previous agenda and second readings of ordinances. Discussion or debate by the council may be held at this time. Councilmembers shall decide whether to amend the ordinance, direct staff to further review the ordinance, refer to council study session or approve or disapprove the ordinance for adoption.

(12) New Business.

(a) New business items include the introduction or first reading of ordinances, and staff reports on those items. Discussion or debate by the council may be held at this time. Councilmembers shall decide whether to amend the ordinance, direct staff to further review the ordinance, refer to council study session or approve or disapprove the ordinance for second reading.

(b) New business items also include a presentation of new proposals by councilmembers for brief discussion. They can include policy changes, new laws, regulations and resolutions. Action is typically not taken on items at this time.

(c) When an ordinance is brought forward for first reading, the city manager, or designee, presents information on a proposed new city law or practice, or a change to an existing law or practice. Council then sets a date for second reading.

(13) Mayor, Council and City Manager Reports. The mayor, council, and the city manager make special announcements or provide updates on current issues or items of council interest at this time.

(14) Consent Agenda. These are routine items voted on by a single motion. Typical items include payment of bills, awarding contracts, adoption of resolutions, and meeting minutes. Any councilmember may move an item to new or continued business for discussion and a vote.

(15) Adjournment. With no further business to come before the council, the mayor adjourns the meeting. Roll call votes will only be taken if requested by a councilmember or as required by law. The official meeting minutes will always reflect a vote on each action item. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.100 Study sessions and workshops.

At the discretion of council, special meetings are held on the fourth Tuesday from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and adjourning no later than 10:00 p.m. To continue past 10:00 p.m., a majority of the council must concur. A notice of the time, place and purpose of such special meeting will be posted pursuant to the requirements as set forth in RCW 42.30.080 or subsequent amendments thereto. During these meetings, items needing in-depth discussion are introduced and reviewed. It is not typical to take a formal action during a study session or workshops. These meetings are open to the public, but no public comment is taken during the discussion of a specific agenda item, unless there is a posted public hearing. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.110 Executive sessions.

An executive session is a council meeting that is closed except to the council, city manager and authorized staff members and/or consultants authorized by the city manager. The public is excluded from attendance. Executive sessions may be held during any council meeting and will be announced by the mayor. Before convening an executive session, the council will make a motion to announce the purpose of the meeting, cite the related state statute, and the anticipated time when the session will be concluded. Should the session require more time, a public announcement shall be made that the meeting is being extended. Executive sessions may be held in accordance with the provisions of the Washington State Open Public Meetings Act. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.120 Other special meetings.

(2) Notice. Notice of every special meeting shall be given in writing to every councilmember, to the city manager, to the city attorney, and to all local news media representatives who have on file with the city clerk a request for such notices. The notice shall be delivered personally, by email, or otherwise, so as to be received at least 24 hours before the meeting. The notice shall state the place and time of the meeting and the business to be conducted. The council shall not make final disposition of any matter not included in the notice. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).


2.02.130 Agenda preparation.

When disqualification of a member or members results, or would result, in the inability of the council to act on a matter on which it is required by law to take action, any member who is absent or who is disqualified under the Appearance of Fairness Doctrine may subsequently participate, provided such member first shall have reviewed all materials and listened to all recordings of the proceedings in which the member did not participate.

(4) Vacancies. Vacancies are advertised so that any interested citizen may submit an application. Preference will be given to citizens of the city of Normandy Park, but applications from residents living outside of the corporate boundaries also receive consideration. Councilmembers are encouraged to solicit applications from qualified citizens. Applications are available from the city clerk’s office. (Ord. 942 § 1, 2016).

2.48.010 Relationship to Public Records Act.

This chapter sets forth the city’s rules and regulations to locally implement the Public Records Act codified at Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.020 Public records officer.

The city clerk shall serve as the city’s public records officer and records custodian for all records other than those maintained by the police department. The police chief or his or her designee shall serve as the public records officer and records custodian for police department records. Contact information for the city clerk and police records officer will be made available to the public in a manner reasonably calculated to provide notice thereof, such as posting at City Hall or on the city’s Internet website. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.030 Maintenance of records.

All substantive and procedural rules of general applicability, including but not limited to ordinances and resolutions of the city council, minutes of the regular meetings of the city council, statements of general policy, and all public contracts, deeds, easements and leases shall be indexed and maintained by the city clerk. All police department records will be indexed and maintained by the police chief or his or her designee. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.040 Index of public records – Findings.

(1) The Public Records Act generally requires all public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of all public records.

(2) RCW 42.56.070(4) provides that an agency need not maintain such an index if to do so would be unduly burdensome, but the agency must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome or would interfere with agency operations.

(3) The city is comprised of numerous departments, their divisions and subdivisions, many if not all of which maintain separate databases and/or systems for the indexing of records and information.

(4) Because the city has records which are diverse, complex and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems, formats and/or databases, it would be unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a current index of all records. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.050 Index of public records – Order.

Based upon the findings set forth in NPMC 2.48.040, and pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(4), the city council orders the following:

(1) The city is not required to maintain an all-inclusive index of public records due to the undue burden and near-impossibility of maintaining such an index.

(2) The city will make available for inspection and/or copying all public records, including any indexes that are maintained by the city as set forth in NPMC 2.48.030, except to the extent that such records are exempt from public disclosure. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.060 Disclosure of public records.

Unless exempt from disclosure under this chapter or other law, public records shall be made available for inspection and copying in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.070 Procedure for inspection or copying.

(1) All persons desiring to obtain police department records shall submit their request in writing to the police chief or his or her designee on forms provided by the police department. All persons desiring to inspect or obtain a copy of any public record other than a police department record shall submit their request in writing to the city clerk. To facilitate the records disclosure process, the city clerk shall create and avail for public use a standard request form to be completed by each requester and which contains the following information:

(a) The name of the requester;

(b) The calendar date of the request;

(c) An accurate description of the record(s) requested;

(d) A statement confirming that the requester will not use any list of individuals provided by the city for commercial purposes;

(e) A statement indicating whether the requester desires to inspect or receive copies of the requested record(s);

(f) The mailing address and/or telephone number of the requester, as well as the requester’s preferred contact method; and

(g) The signature of the requester.

(2) Reasonable assistance as may be necessary to help a requester locate particular records shall be provided either by the city clerk, by the police chief or his designee in the case of police records, or by the city department maintaining the records; provided, that the provision of such assistance shall not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the city clerk, the department, or the assisting employee.

(3) Except to the extent required or authorized by law, the city shall not distinguish among persons requesting records. Persons requesting records shall not be required to provide information as to the purpose for the request, except to establish whether the inspection or copying would violate Chapter 42.56 RCW or other statute or ordinance that exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records to certain persons and/or for specified purposes. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.075 Access to public records.

Disclosure of public records shall be governed by the following procedures:

(1) Public records shall be made available without disrupting essential functions of the office. Any city employee who believes that such essential functions would be interrupted by a request for public records shall consult with the city manager.

(2) Retrieval of records from any off-premises storage facility maintained by the city shall occur no more frequently than once per calendar week.

(3) Duplicate, carbon copy or other secondary records are to be dealt with in the same manner as the original or primary copy.

(4) With respect to photocopying that will occur at City Hall, prearrangement for copies of records is recommended so that the request may be accommodated within staff work schedule. Photocopying which cannot be completed at City Hall will be forwarded to an outside facility of the city’s choosing. The requester will be billed for such services at the city’s cost.

(5) Production of transcripts and reproduction of taped or digital recordings shall be completed in a manner that does not disrupt essential functions of the city. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.080 Processing public records requests.

(1) Responses to requests for public records shall be made promptly pursuant to Chapter 42.56 RCW. Within five business days of receiving a written request for a record, the city clerk (or the police chief or his or her designee in the case of police department records) shall:

(a) Provide the record; or

(b) Acknowledge that the city has received the request and (i) provide a reasonable estimate of the time the city will require to respond to the request, or (ii) request a more accurate clarification of the request from the requester; or

(c) Deny the public record request in whole or in part.

(2) Public records may be made available on a partial or installment basis as records that are part of a larger set of requested records are assembled or made ready for public inspection or copying. Additional time to respond to a request may be based upon the need to clarify an accurate description of the request, to locate and assemble the information requested, to notify third persons or agencies affected by the request, or to determine whether any of the information requested is exempt. If a public records request is unclear, the city clerk (or the police chief or his or her designee in the case of police department records) may ask the requester to clarify what information the requester is requesting. If the requester fails to clarify the request, the city need not further respond to or process the request.

(3) If the city clerk (or the police chief or his or her designee in the case of police department records) determines that the document is exempt in part but can be made available after deletion or redaction of exempt portions, the request shall be granted; provided, that such exempt portions shall first be deleted or redacted. If the city clerk or police chief or designee determines to deny the request, in whole or in part, a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial shall be provided to the requester; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the city to disclose portions of a requested document if the entire document is exempt from disclosure. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.085 Review of denials of public records requests.

(1) Upon any denial of a request for a public record, the requester may initiate administrative review of the decision by submitting a written objection to the city clerk or to the police chief or his or her designee in the case of police department records. Upon receipt of any such written objection, the city clerk or the police chief or his or her designee shall refer the matter to the city manager who shall recommend affirming or reversing the original denial. The city shall thereupon provide a written response to the requester within two business days following the original denial. Such written response shall constitute the city’s final decision with respect to any written objection submitted by a requester.

(2) Administrative remedies shall not be considered exhausted until the city has provided a written response pursuant to subsection (1) of this section or until the close of the second business day following the requester’s submission of a written objection, whichever occurs first. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.090 Exemptions.

The city adopts by reference the exemptions from public disclosure contained in Chapter 42.56 RCW, including any future amendments thereto or recodification thereof, along with any other express or implied exemption or exception to the Public Records Act provided by law, including but not limited to those exemptions set forth in Exhibit C to “Public Records Act for Washington Cities and Counties,” Municipal Research and Services Center, Report No. 61, July 2006, a copy of which shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.100 Reimbursement for copying costs.

(1) No fee shall be charged for the inspection of public records.

(2) Any person who requests a copy of any public record shall pay to the city clerk a copying charge. The copying charges for public records, including but not limited to photocopies, maps, photographs including slides, audio recordings, video tape recordings and diskettes shall be established by city council resolution; provided, that if the fee for a particular category of public record has not been specifically established by city council resolution, the amount of the fee shall be the maximum amount permissible by law and necessary to enable full recoupment of the city’s actual expenses incurred in reproducing the record. Nothing herein shall be construed to apply to accident reports pursuant to RCW 46.52.085, which shall be provided to requesters at the city’s actual cost.

(3) The city may charge all costs directly incident to shipping such public records, including but not limited to the cost of any postage and/or delivery charges and the cost of any container or envelope pursuant to RCW 42.56.070(7).

(4) The city may, at its discretion, require the requester to deposit a sum in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of providing copies in response to a request. If the records are made available on a partial or installment basis, the city may charge for each part of the request as it is provided. If an installment of a records request is not paid for or reviewed within 20 days after the city provides notice of availability of the installment, the city shall not be obligated to fulfill the balance of the request. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.110 Model rules and administrative procedures.

The city may, in its discretion, follow the Public Records Act Model Rules codified at Chapter 44-14 WAC on file at the city clerk’s office. Upon recommendation of the city clerk, the city manager may issue additional administrative procedures for the implementation of this chapter. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).


2.48.120 Misuse of public records – Penalty.

Any person who intentionally and unlawfully removes, alters, mutilates, destroys, disorganizes, conceals, erases, obliterates or falsifies any public record shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 843 § 1, 2009).

4.09.010 Overview, application and review process.

The city and applicant for a franchise and other permits associated with the deployment of small wireless facilities face challenges in coordinating applicable legislative and administrative processes under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. A franchise for the use of the city’s right-of-way is a form of contract which requires approval by the city council. Permits to exercise the rights granted under such a franchise and to install small wireless facilities on private property are considered in a parallel, consolidated administrative process. FCC regulation provides safe harbor time periods as well as completeness requirements which apply to all approvals relating to a small wireless facility deployment. Time limitations governing the process are triggered by the applicant’s submittal of applications for the deployment. Accordingly, all parts of an application for a master permit to deploy small wireless facilities must be considered in order to determine completeness. Applicants are encouraged and expected to provide all related applications in one submittal.

(1) Application Process. The director is authorized to establish franchise and other application forms to gather the information required by these ordinances from applicants and to determine the completeness of the application process as provided herein.

(a) Franchise. The process typically begins with and depends upon approval of a franchise for the use of the public right-of-way to deploy small wireless facilities if any portion of the applicant’s facilities are to be located in the right-of-way. The application for a franchise is designated as Part A of the application. An applicant with a valid franchise for the deployment of small wireless facilities in the city may proceed to apply for a small wireless facilities permit and related approvals (Parts B and C). An applicant at its option may utilize phased development. Because franchises are required by federal law to be competitively neutral, the city has established a franchise format for use by all right-of-way users. The format contains the basic requirements for the use of right-of-way. Consideration of the franchise application is a legislative act of the city council. Consideration by the city council shall run parallel with other necessary administrative approvals and approval or possession of a franchise is a requirement for any small wireless facility deployment seeking to use the public right-of-way.

(b) Small Wireless Facility Permits. Part B of the application process requires specification of all small wireless facility components and their sites. Each component shall be described in detail as provided in these ordinances. Any request for deviation, whether minor or significant, from adopted city standards shall be set forth in the application.

(c) Associated Permit(s). Part C of the application shall attach all associated permits such as applications or checklists required under the critical areas, shorelines or SEPA ordinances. Applicants for deployment of small wireless facilities in city design districts or underground areas shall provide a concealment plan as provided herein in NPMC 18.42.110(6).

(d) Construction in the Right-of-Way. Small wireless facilities installed pursuant to an approved master permit (both a franchise and a small wireless facility permit) or a small wireless facility permit approved separately for an existing franchisee may proceed to install the approved specific facilities by complying with the requirements contained in Chapter 10.48 NPMC; provided, however, that an approved small wireless permit to install small wireless facilities in the public right-of-way shall authorize entry into the public right-of-way to install the approved facilities if acted upon within 60 days of approval by email or written notification to the director.

(e) Later Discovered Deviations. Recognizing that each utility pole represents a unique environment for the installation of small wireless facilities, if a deviation, whether minor or significant, is required from the standards of this chapter in order to install a small wireless facility on any structure, and such deviation was not approved as part of the master permit or small wireless facility permit process, an application shall be filed for the amendment of the initial small wireless facility permit. Administrative review of the request for deviation shall be processed as provided herein. Such an amended application shall be considered a new application and completeness, review and all time periods shall commence anew.

(f) Leases. A wireless service provider who wishes to attach to any utility pole or other structure or building owned by the city shall include an application for a lease(s) as a component of its application. The director is authorized to administer a lease review process, develop an application form and approve leases in the form approved for general use by the city council for any utility pole or other structure in the right-of-way, including a new utility pole or structure. The installation shall conform to the standards adopted in NPMC 18.42.110 or with an approved minor deviation. Leases for the use of other public property, buildings or facilities including any park land or facility shall be submitted to the city council for approval. Any approval identified in the initial application process shall be considered by the city council in conjunction with its consideration of the franchise. Applications submitted at later dates shall be considered by the director or the city council as provided herein under a separate review process.

(2) Completeness. Any and all parts of an application for the deployment of small wireless facilities including but not limited to franchise, small wireless facility permits and all associated permits shall be submitted at one time in order that their completeness may be considered. An applicant seeking to phase deployment of a small wireless facilities system may identify the intended phasing in the franchise application process. Franchisees with a valid franchise to deploy small wireless facilities may apply for a small wireless permit for the deployment of initial or additional phases of a small wireless facility deployment at any time subject to the commencement of a new completeness review time period for permit processing.

(3) Safe Harbors. The FCC, 47 CFR 1.6003, has established presumptively reasonable time periods for review of facilities for the deployment of small wireless facilities. The city shall make every reasonable effort consistent with any conflicting provisions of state or federal law, and the preservation of the city’s health, safety and aesthetic environment to comply with these time periods to the fullest extent possible. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017).


4.09.020 Application.

Applicants shall apply using the city’s franchise application form and submit a fee deposit as provided in NPMC 4.08.040 and the city’s fee resolution. The fee deposit level shall be set by the director of community development (“director”). The director is charged with administration of small wireless deployments and other wireless communication review processes established under this chapter and Chapters 4.10 and 18.42 NPMC. Service providers seeking to utilize the city’s right-of-way for small wireless deployments shall specify geographic boundaries for the small wireless deployment described in the application. Phased development is permitted, and an applicant is encouraged to specify at least the initial small wireless deployment in its small wireless permit application.

In addition to the requirements of Chapter 4.08 NPMC, the following information shall be provided by all applicants for a small wireless permit. Existing franchisees who seek to utilize a small wireless deployment to expand, assist or implement an existing franchise shall provide the information as a part of a small wireless permit application for small wireless deployment.

(1) Designation of Facilities. The application shall provide specific locational information including GIS coordinates of all facilities to the extent known and specify whether and where small wireless facilities are to be located on existing utility poles including city-owned light standards included in the definition of utility pole, or will utilize replacement utility poles, new poles, towers, and/or other structures. Conduit and/or ground-mounted equipment necessary for and intended for use in the deployment shall also be specified regardless of whether the additional facilities are to be constructed by the applicant or leased from a third party. Detailed schematics and visual renderings of the facilities shall be provided by the applicant. Failure to provide sufficient detail may result in a later finding of a significant change in the facility if significant elements of the facility were not shown on the originally approved franchise exhibit. Failure to include significant elements may also result in the requirement that new or undocumented elements complete the approval processes detailed in this chapter and in Chapter 18.42 NPMC.

(2) The director may approve, deny or conditionally approve all or any portion of the sites proposed in the small wireless permit application.

(3) An application for a small wireless permit which contains an element which is not exempt from SEPA review shall simultaneously apply under Chapter 43.21C RCW and Chapter 13.12 NPMC.

(4) RF Certification. The applicant shall submit a sworn affidavit signed by an RF engineer with knowledge of the proposed project affirming that the small wireless deployment will be compliant with all FCC and other governmental regulations in connection with human exposure to radio frequency emissions for every frequency at which the small wireless facility and associated wireless backhaul will operate. An existing franchisee applying for a small wireless permit for small wireless deployment shall provide an RF certification for all facilities included in the deployment which are to be installed by the franchisee. If facilities necessary to the small wireless deployment are to be provided by a third party, the right-of-way use permit to deploy such facilities shall be contingent on submittal of an RF certification by the third party for such facilities and the requirement that such third party obtain a franchise. If such facilities will emit RF emissions, this additional RF certification shall address the cumulative impact of the RF emissions and certify compliance with federal requirements and the initial franchise following installation. The applicant shall immediately remove any facilities that exceed FCC RF emissions requirements. A modification of the facility by an eligible facilities request requires a new RF certification.

(5) Regulatory Authorization. Applicants for a small wireless permit for the facilities shall provide proof of FCC and other regulatory approvals required to provide the service(s) or utilize the technologies sought to be installed. See also NPMC 4.08.030(2)(j) for rules and application submittals for small wireless facilities that seek to attach or replace city-owned utility poles and other structures.

(6) Completeness – Franchise and Small Wireless Applications. The director or his/her designee shall review an application for completeness and notify in writing the applicant by the tenth day after submission whether the application is complete by clearly and specifically identifying missing documents or information; provided, however, that an applicant may consent to a different completeness review period. The review process and any tolling of the applicable presumptively reasonable review period shall occur in compliance with 47 CFR 1.6003. No application shall be deemed complete without the fee deposit set by the director. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017).


4.09.030 Review process.

The following provisions relate to applications for a franchise which seeks to utilize small wireless facilities or small wireless permit for small wireless deployments.

(1) Review of Facilities. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant shall be governed by the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 253 and 332 and applicable case law. Applicants for franchises and the small wireless permits as well as all permits and approvals consolidated with such applications for review shall be treated in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner with other service providers utilizing supporting infrastructure which is functionally equivalent; that is, service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement or cumulative impacts. Franchise and small wireless permit review under this chapter shall neither prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services.

(2) Concealment. Upon application for a small wireless permit or for facilities designated within a franchise, the city will permit small wireless deployment on existing utility poles conforming to the city’s generally applicable aesthetic, design and concealment standards. See NPMC 18.42.110. Accordingly, small wireless facilities installed pursuant to this concealment authorization may not be expanded pursuant to an eligible facilities request when the director determines that such expansion would defeat the concealment elements of the facilities. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 981 § 3, 2018; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017).


4.09.040 Public notice.

The city shall provide notice of a complete application for a small wireless permit on the city’s website with a link to the application. This notice requirement shall also apply to existing franchisees applying for a small wireless deployment. The notice shall include an email contact and telephone number for the applicant to answer citizen inquiries. This notice is for the public’s information and is not a part of any hearing nor subject to any land use appeal process. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017).


4.09.050 Small wireless permit and minor deviations.

(1) The director shall review applications for small wireless permits for small wireless deployments. The director may authorize minor deviations in the small wireless permit from the dimensional design and concealment technologies referenced in the exhibits to the franchise or design standards.

(2) Deviations in the dimensions, height, or volume of small cell facilities, which are necessary to conform the facilities to the requirements of the pole owner, provide adequate safety clearances or address similar technical issues, may be approved as minor deviations; provided, that the deviations do not cause the facility as revised to exceed the definition of a small wireless facility. Replacement of components of an existing, approved small wireless facility which do not exceed the volumetric limitations for a small wireless facility may also be approved as deviations. Provided, however, that in each instance the new or revised facilities do not defeat the concealment features set by the city’s generally applicable small wireless aesthetic, design and concealment standard or a specific concealment plan adopted pursuant to Chapter 18.42 NPMC.

(3) The decision of the director to approve a small wireless permit with a minor deviation, if any, shall be final and is not subject to appeal under city code or further legislative review. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 981 § 5, 2018; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017. Formerly 4.09.060).


4.09.060 Wireless communication and small wireless deployment facility approvals and processes.

Approval of a franchise, small wireless permit and/or other approval referenced in this chapter are conditioned on the following requirements:

(1) Comply with applicable design or concealment standards.

(2) Obtain the written approval of the owner of any utility pole for the installation of its facilities on such utility pole. Approval of a franchise does not authorize attachment to city-owned utility poles or other structures.

(3) Unless specifically provided for in a franchise, obtain a lease from the city to utilize the city’s ground space for the installation of any new pole, a replacement utility pole over 60 feet or to locate any new ground-based structure, base station or other attendant equipment on city right-of-way, city property or for attachment to or replacement of a city-owned utility pole or structure.

(4) Comply with all city construction standards and state and federal codes when operating in the right-of-way and obtain a required permit to enter the right-of-way.

(5) Replacement Utility Pole – Street Lighting. With the express permission of the city, a new utility pole may be permitted in the form of a new street light standard. The design of the street light standard shall be in accordance with adopted city construction standards or approved by the director by a small wireless permit. Wherever technologically feasible, all equipment and cabling shall be internal to the replacement street lighting standard.

(6) Small wireless facilities approved pursuant to this chapter shall be considered as an outright permitted use when located within the right-of-way. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017. Formerly 4.09.080).


4.09.070 Additional review procedures.

Wireless communication facilities in shoreline management zones or critical areas are subject to review as provided in Chapter 13.12 NPMC and NPMC Title 16; provided, that, while Chapter 16.20 NPMC generally prohibits wireless communication facilities, small wireless may be approved as a shoreline conditional use. (Ord. 990 § 2, 2019; Ord. 959 § 2, 2017. Formerly 4.09.090).

(1) Application Review. “Eligible facilities request” is defined in NPMC 18.42.040.

(a) Application. The director shall prepare and make publicly available an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for the city to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification.

(b) Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request pursuant to this chapter, the director shall review such application to determine whether the application qualifies as an eligible facilities request.

(c) Time Frame for Review. Within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this chapter, the director shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this section.

(2) Tolling of the Time Frame for Review. The 60-day review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement by the director and the applicant or in cases where the director determines that the application is incomplete. The time frame for review of an eligible facilities request is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications. 

(a) To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the director shall provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application.

(b) The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant makes supplemental submission in response to the director’s notice of incompleteness.

(c) Following a supplemental submission, the director will notify the applicant within 10 days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this sub-section. Second or subsequent notice of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 

(3) Determination That Application Is Not an Eligible Facilities Request. If the director determines that the applicant’s request does not qualify as an eligible facilities request, the director shall deny the application. To the extent additional information is necessary, the director may request such information from the applicant to evaluate the application under other provisions of this chapter and applicable law.

(4) Failure to Act. In the event the director fails to approve or deny a request for an eligible facilities request within the time frame for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the director in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. 

(5) Remedies. Both the applicant and the city may bring claims related to Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act to any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 959 § 4, 2017). 


4.10.030 Collocation.

Collocations that are not considered eligible facilities requests shall be processed within 90 days of receipt of a complete application. The director will notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of an application whether it is complete or if additional information is required. The term “collocation” shall not apply to the initial placement of a small cell facility on a utility pole or on any other base station or tower that was not constructed for the sole or primary purpose of an FCC-licensed antenna and its associated facilities. (Ord. 959 § 4, 2017). 


4.10.040 New wireless communication facilities.

New wireless communications facilities shall be processed within 150 days of receipt of a complete application. The director will notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of an application whether it is complete or if additional information is required. (Ord. 959 § 4, 2017).

It is the intended purpose of this chapter to recognize the importance and benefits of freedom of expression to a democratic society. Experience has shown, however, that sexually oriented business establishments, as defined herein, are detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Sexually oriented business establishments are historically linked with organized crime, prostitution, narcotics, and other unlawful and criminal activity. These activities often lead to the development of public nuisances, including moral nuisances. Therefore, the licensing and operation of sexually oriented business establishments should be regulated and monitored through the system of licensing and operating regulations contained in this chapter. (Ord. 822 § 2, 2008).


4.14.020 Scope.

This chapter governs the licensing and operation of all sexually oriented business establishments within the city. The location and siting of sexually oriented business establishments may also be governed by other city regulations. Compliance with this chapter is required in addition to compliance with any other applicable city regulations and is not a substitute therefor. (Ord. 822 § 2, 2008).

A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall: 

(1) Permit the franchisee to engage in the business of operating a cable system and providing cable service within the city;

The city shall be allowed the opportunity to ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain further information from whatever source. A refusal by an applicant to cooperate or provide requested information is sufficient grounds for the city to deny an application. 

(3) Upon receipt of an application for an initial franchise and after obtaining any additional information the city in its sole discretion deems appropriate from any source, a hearing shall be scheduled to allow public comment. At the hearing, the city council shall receive public comment regarding the following:

(b) Whether the applicant appears to have adequate legal, financial and technical qualifications and capabilities to build, operate and maintain a cable system in the city; 

(c) Whether the applicant has any conflicting interests, either financial or commercial, that will be contrary to the interests of the city;

(Ord. 792 § 10, 2007).


4.16.100 Use of rights-of-way. 

For the purposes of operating and maintaining a cable system in the city, a franchisee may place and maintain within the rights-of-way such property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the cable system. Prior to construction of the cable system in the rights-of-way, the franchisee shall procure all necessary permits, pay all applicable fees in connection therewith and comply with all applicable laws, regulations, resolutions and ordinances, including, but not limited to, land use and zoning requirements.

Scheduled interruptions that the cable operator anticipates will last more than four hours shall occur during periods of minimum use of the cable system as reasonably determined by the cable operator.

The cable operator shall issue a credit or refund to a customer within 30 business days after the close of the billing cycle following the return of the equipment and request for disconnection. If a customer was required to provide a deposit, that deposit must be returned with any interest accrued on the deposit. 

(6) Treatment of Property. 

(a) Removal or trimming of trees and shrubs in the right-of-way will be subject to the regulations of the city.

9.02.020 Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study of the City of Normandy Park (FIS),” with accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM), all dated May 16, 1995, and all future updates, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this title. The flood insurance study and maps are on file at City Hall, 801 SW 174th Street, Normandy Park, WA 98166. (Ord. 739 § 2, 2004; Ord. 594 § 1, 1994; Ord. 507 § 2(a), 1989).


9.02.030 Compliance/penalties.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this title and other applicable regulations. Any structure or land hereafter constructed, located, extended, converted or altered in violation of this chapter may be deemed a public nuisance. Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of these requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of the requirements set forth herein shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both for each violation, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy such violation. (Ord. 507 § 2(b), 1989).


9.02.040 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easement, covenants or deed restrictions.

(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted to the city under state statutes. (Ord. 507 § 2(d), 1989).


9.02.060 Warning and disclaimer of liability.

The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create any legal liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 507 § 2(e), 1989).

(k) The costs of providing government services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges. (Ord. 924 § 2(B), 2015; Ord. 833 § 3, 2009; Ord. 507 § 4(a), (b), 1989).


9.02.140 Conditions for variances.

(1) Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be granted shall be for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size continuous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below base flood level, provided that the variance criteria listed above have been fully considered.

(2) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places of the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedure set forth in this section.

(3) Variances shall not be granted within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(4) Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(5) Variances shall only be granted upon:

(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;

(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or a victimization of the public or conflict with the existing local laws or ordinances.

(6) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that such variances pertain to a physical piece of property; such variances being not personal in nature and do not pertain to a structure, inhabitants thereof, or economic or financial circumstances.

(7) Variances may be granted for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have a load damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except NPMC 9.02.130(2)(b), and otherwise complies with the general standards of this chapter.

(8) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 507 § 4(c), 1989).

Article V. Provisions For Flood  Hazard Protection


9.02.150 General standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

(1) Anchoring.

(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.

(b) All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).

(2) Construction Material and Methods.

(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

(b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(c) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

(3) Utilities.

(a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;

(b) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and

(c) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to such systems or contamination from such systems during flooding.

(4) Subdivision Proposals.

(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flooding;

(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and

(d) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development that contain at least 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

(5) Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study or from another authoritative source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 739 § 5, 2004; Ord. 507 § 5(a), 1989).


9.02.160 Specific standards.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in NPMC 9.02.020 or 9.02.090, the following provisions are required:

(1) Residential Construction.

(a) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation.

(b) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(i) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.

(2) Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

(a) Be floodproofed so that below one foot above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

(b) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effect of buoyancy;

(c) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the local administrator as required by NPMC 9.02.070(3);

(d) Nonresidential structures that are elevated, but not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in subsection (1)(b) of this section;

(e) Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to one foot above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level).

(3) Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones A1 – 30, AH, and AE on the community’s FIRM shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is to or above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of NPMC 9.02.150(1). (Ord. 739 § 6, 2004; Ord. 507 § 5(b), 1989).


9.02.170 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in NPMC 9.02.020 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new constructions, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

(2) Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for:

(a) Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure that do not increase the ground floor area; and

(b) Repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(i) Before the repair, reconstruction, or repair is started; or

(ii) If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places may be excluded in the 50 percent.

(3) If subsection (1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of NPMC 9.02.150 and 9.02.160. (Ord. 739 § 7, 2004; Ord. 507 § 5(c), 1989).


9.02.180 Wetlands management.

To the maximum extent possible, each development subject to this chapter shall avoid the short- and long-term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands, especially those activities which limit or disrupt the ability of the wetland to alleviate flooding impacts. The following process shall be implemented for such development:

(1) Review proposals for development within base floodplains for their possible impacts on wetlands located within the floodplain.

(2) Ensure that development activities in or around wetlands do not negatively affect public safety, health, and welfare by disrupting the ability of the wetland to reduce flood and storm drainage.

(3) Request technical assistance from the Department of Ecology in identifying wetland areas. Existing wetland map information from the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) may be used in conjunction with the area’s FIRM to prepare an overlay zone indicating critical wetland areas deserving special attention. (Ord. 507 § 5(d), 1989).


9.02.190 Coastal high hazard area.

Located within areas of special flood hazard, established in NPMC 9.02.020, are coastal high hazard areas, which are designated as Zones V1 – V30, VE and/or V. These areas have special flood hazards associated with high velocity waters from surges and therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in this chapter, the following provisions shall also apply:

(1) All new allowable construction and substantial improvement in Zones V1 – V30 and VE (V if base flood elevation data is available) shall be elevated on pilings and columns so that:

(a) The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the piling or columns) is elevated to or above the base flood level; and

(b) The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of subsection (1)(a) and (1)(b) of this section.

(2) Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures in zones V1 – 30 and VE, and whether or not such structures contain a basement. The local administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.

(3) All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide.

(4) Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse, displacement or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. For the purposes of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and no more than 20 pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls that exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet the following conditions:

(a) Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

(b) The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).

(5) If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. Such space shall not be used for human habitation.

(6) Manufactured homes must comply with all provisions in subsections (1) through (5) of this section.

(7) Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings.

(8) Prohibit manmade alteration of sand dunes that would increase potential flood damage. (Ord. 739 § 8, 2004; Ord. 507 § 5(e), 1989).


9.02.200 Encroachment.

The cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. (Ord. 507 § 5(f), 1989).

12.28.060 Charges in lieu of assessment.

Certain tracts of land benefited by the sewer improvement under L.I.D. 66-SS-1 contained land area grossly in excess of the area requirements of the city building code as a building site which lots did not appear to be of sufficient size to authorize subdivision into additional legal building sites, and such tracts which did not appear to be of sufficient area to permit subdivision were assessed only for general facility benefits on an area basis together with special benefits to the extent of building sites clearly permissible under the zoning regulation at the time of confirming the assessment roll. The owner or user of any parcel of land thereafter subdivided from such a tract, or authorized as a building site by the action of the hearing examiner* in granting a variance from the city zoning regulations, as a condition of obtaining a building permit and a permit to hook onto and use the city public sewer, shall pay a charge in lieu of assessment, equal to the difference in amount which was assessed for the area of the newly authorized building site and the amount of the assessment which would have been levied against such site had it been a legal building lot at the time of confirming the assessment roll of the said local improvement district. (Ord. 189 § 2, 1967; Ord. 168 § 14, 1965).

*Code reviser’s note: Ordinances 783 and 831 replaced the board of adjustment with the hearing examiner position.


12.28.061 Latecomer charges in lieu of assessment.

Owners of property which has not been assessed for benefits accruing from sewer improvements established in a local improvement district or by a developer’s extension (under Chapter 12.32 NPMC) shall, as a condition of connection to the public sewer, pay a latecomer charge in lieu of assessment, which shall be computed by application of the formula utilized in computing assessments within the L.I.D. for the cost of the public sewer or by a similar computation to determine such property’s share of the burden of recovering the developer’s cost for the extension. (Ord. 275 § 3, 1974).


12.28.062 Latecomer charges for sewer connection.

Owners of properties seeking to connect to the city’s sewer system shall pay, prior to such connection, in addition to the assessment and connection fee as required by this chapter, a latecomer charge representing their pro-rata share of the prior cost of the system, which charge shall be computed as follows:

(1) Property located within the boundaries of Local Improvement District 62-SS-1 or any other local improvement district existing as of the date of requested connection shall pay a sum equal to that portion of the monthly service charge paid by owners of similar property which is attributable to repayment of sewer treatment plant bonds and sewer construction bonds, multiplied by the number of months from commencement of such monthly service charge until the month immediately preceding the month during which latecomer connection is made.

(2) Property located outside the boundaries of Local Improvement District 62-SS-1 or any other local improvement district shall pay the sum as indicated in subsection (1) of this section and, in addition thereto, a sum equal to the special assessments which would have been levied by the local improvement district against the latecomer’s property if the property had been located within the boundaries of the local improvement district at the time the district was formed, and including a charge based upon the current Seattle Consumer Price Index from the year 1967; provided, that such sum shall not exceed the estimated special assessments which would be levied against the latecomer’s property if a new local improvement district was formed. The determination of the estimated special assessments shall be made by the city manager based upon current cost data obtained from the sewer district operating the system to which the latecomer will be connected.

(3)  All funds derived from the above charges shall be deposited into the 403 sewer revenue trust fund in an effort to forestall the need for future rate increases. (Ord. 329 § 1, 1978).

(6) To compute and bill the land developer for an area assessment based on a charge of one cent a square foot for all property except public streets within the plat or subdivision as the land developer’s contribution to the cost of city’s general sewer facilities. The area assessment paid by the land developer is not to be considered as a construction cost;

(7) To compute the value of an assessable unit for assessment or distribution portion of total costs of the local collection system installed by the land developer both within and without the area of the plat or subdivision, using a zone and termini, or a modified zone and termini method to determine the total number of assessable units in the plat or subdivision;

(8) To restrict other parties from connecting to the facility installed by the land developer until the city has collected a charge in lieu of assessment, in cash, from the requesting parties;

(9) To reimburse the land developer for the cost of his sewer extension through remitting to the developer for a period not to exceed 10 years, or until the sooner reimbursement of charges collected by the city from users who did not contribute to the original cost of such sewer facility on the following basis:

(a) The property of the party requesting service through connection to a developer’s extension shall be charged for general facilities on an area basis and for local facilities benefiting the property connected to the developer’s extensions by using the value of an assessable unit computed as per subsection (7) of this section to determine the local portion of the assessment. The area assessment shall be computed on the basis of one cent a square foot. The local assessment will be divided between the developer and the city on 90-10% basis with the developer receiving the 90 percent share to reimburse the developer for the cost of the facilities benefiting the land of others who may be served by connections to said facilities and who did not make a full contribution to the original cost of such sewer facilities.

(b) The city shall share sums charged and collected in lieu of assessments to reimburse the land developer for the extension according to the agreed formula during the 10-year period from the date of acceptance of the sewer system by the city or until such reimbursement is completed within such period. Thereafter, all revenue from such charges in lieu of assessments shall be retained by the city.

13.08.005 Purposes.

The council finds this chapter is necessary in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for the comprehensive management of surface and stormwater and erosion control, especially that which preserves and utilizes the many values of the city’s natural drainage system including open space, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and education. The council also finds that the city of Normandy Park should conduct programs to reduce flooding, erosion, and sedimentation; prevent and mitigate habitat loss; enhance groundwater recharge; and prevent water quality degradation through the implementation of comprehensive and thorough permit review, construction inspection, enforcement, and maintenance in order to promote the effectiveness of the requirements contained in this chapter.

In addition, the purpose of this chapter is to protect the city’s surface and groundwater quality by providing minimum requirements for reducing and controlling the discharge of contaminants. The city council recognizes that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or through the collective impact of many small discharges. Therefore, this chapter prohibits the discharge of contaminants into surface and stormwater and groundwater in accordance with Chapter 90.48 RCW, and outlines preventive measures to restrict contaminants from entering such waters. These measures include the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) by the residents and businesses of the city.

Furthermore, the Normandy Park city council finds this chapter necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of Normandy Park and the integrity of the city’s resources for the benefit of all by: minimizing or eliminating water quality degradation; preserving and enhancing the suitability of waters for recreation, fishing, and other beneficial uses; and preserving and enhancing the aesthetic quality and biotic integrity of the water. The city council recognizes that implementation of this chapter is required under the Federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. In meeting the intent of the Clean Water Act the city council also recognizes the importance of maintaining economic viability while providing necessary environmental protection and believes this chapter helps achieve both goals. (Ord. 955 § 2 (Exh. 2), 2017; Ord. 805 § 2, 2008).


13.08.010 Scope.

Compliance with the standards in this chapter and the adopted stormwater management manual does not necessarily mitigate all probable and significant environmental impacts to aquatic biota. Fishery resources and other living components of aquatic systems are affected by a complex set of factors. While employing a specific flow control standard may prevent stream channel erosion or instability, other factors affecting fish and other biotic resources (such as increases in stream flow velocities) are not directly addressed by the stormwater management manual. Thus, compliance with this manual should not be construed as mitigating all probable and significant stormwater impacts, and additional mitigation may be required to protect aquatic biota in streams and wetlands. Stricter regulations imposed by other laws, ordinances, and rules shall still pertain. (Ord. 955 § 2 (Exh. 2), 2017; Ord. 805 § 2, 2008).


13.08.020 Definitions.

The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this chapter:

“AKART” is an acronym for “all known, available, and reasonable methods of prevention, control, and treatment.” AKART shall represent the most current methodology that can be reasonably required for preventing, controlling, or abating the pollutants associated with a discharge. The concept of AKART applies to both point and nonpoint sources of pollution.

“Applicant” means a property owner or a public agency or public or private utility which owns a right-of-way or other easement or has been adjudicated the right to such an easement pursuant to Chapter 8.12 RCW, or any person or entity designated or named in writing by the property or easement owner to be the applicant, in an application for a development proposal, permit or approval.

“Arterial” means a road or street primarily for through traffic. The term generally includes roads or streets considered collectors. It does not include local access roads which are generally limited to providing access to abutting property.

“Basin” means a drainage area that drains either to Miller Creek, Normandy Creek, Walker Creek, Arrow Lake, Des Moines Creek, or the drainage areas that drain directly to Puget Sound.

“Basin plan” means a plan and all implementing regulations and procedures including, but not limited to, capital projects, public education activities and land use management adopted by ordinance, resolution, interlocal agreement, or other law for managing surface and stormwater management facilities and features within individual subbasins.

“Best management practices (BMPs)” means the best available and reasonable physical, structural, managerial, or behavioral activities, that when used singly or in combination eliminate or reduce the contamination of surface and/or groundwater.

“Bioretention” means an engineered facility that treats stormwater by passing it through a specified soil profile, and either retains or detains the treated stormwater for flow attenuation. Refer to the Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington (SWMMWW), Chapter 7 of Volume V for bioretention BMP types and design specifications.

“Certified erosion and sediment control lead (CESCL)” means an individual who has current certification through an approved erosion and sediment control training program that meets the minimum training standards established by the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) (see BMP C160 in the Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington (SWMMWW)). A CESCL is knowledgeable in the principles and practices of erosion and sediment control.

(e) Any project which includes land-disturbing activities which expose more than 120 square feet of soil. Routine landscape maintenance practices outside critical areas and ongoing gardening and farming activities shall be excluded from drainage review unless the drainage patterns are substantially modified.

(2) Type of Drainage Review. The drainage review for any proposed project shall be targeted to the scope of the project’s size, type of development and potential for impacts to the regional surface water system to facilitate preparation and review of project applications. If drainage review for a proposed project is required, the city shall determine which of the following drainage reviews apply as specified herein or in the stormwater design manual:

(a) Small-site drainage review; or

(b) Full drainage review. Use the flow charts in Figures 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 in Volume I of the SWMMWW to determine which of the minimum requirements apply.

(3) Exemptions. The provisions of this section do not apply to any development or improvement described in subsection (1)(a) or (d) of this section with a building footprint or impervious surface, or both, less than a total of 120 square feet. This exemption may be used once in any 12-month period, limited to a lifetime maximum percentage of impervious surface lot coverage as follows:

(a) Zones R-5 and R-7.2: 60 percent maximum lot coverage;

(b) Zone R-12.5: 50 percent maximum lot coverage;

13.08.050 Drainage plan – Requirements.

(1) Minimum Requirements. Every permit application with drainage review must meet each of the following requirements, which are described in detail in the 2012 Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington. Small single-family residential projects with less than 10,000 square feet of total impervious surfaces and less than 5,000 square feet of existing plus new and replaced hard surfaces may be able to use the City of Normandy Park Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual for project planning, design, and submittal purposes. Projects that do not meet the criteria for use of the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual shall use the flow charts in Figures 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 in Volume I of the SWMMWW to determine which of the minimum requirements apply. Redevelopment projects shall mitigate the impacts from existing impervious surfaces and new plus replaced hard surfaces to the extent practicable, and as required by the appropriate stormwater management manual.

(a) Requirement No. 1 – Preparation of Stormwater Site Plans. All projects shall prepare a stormwater site plan for city review. The city of Normandy Park requires the retention of native vegetation, minimization of impervious surfaces and use of LID techniques for on-site management of stormwater runoff to the extent feasible. Stormwater site plans shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the applicable stormwater or drainage manual.

(b) Requirement No. 2 – Construction Stormwater Pollution Prevention. All projects shall comply with construction stormwater pollution prevention and erosion control as required by the manual utilized. All proposed projects that will clear, grade, or otherwise disturb the site shall provide erosion and sediment control that prevents, to the maximum extent practical, the transport of sediment from the site to drainage facilities, water resources and adjacent properties. For projects that are not eligible for planning and approval under the requirements of the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual the following requirements apply:

(i) A construction stormwater pollution plan (SWPPP) is required for all projects which result in 2,000 square feet or more of new plus replaced hard surface area, or which disturb 7,000 square feet or more of land.

(ii) Projects below those thresholds are not required to prepare a construction SWPPP, but must consider all of the elements listed below for construction SWPPPs and develop controls for all elements that pertain to the project site.

(iii) General Requirements. The SWPPP shall include a narrative and drawings. All BMPs shall be clearly referenced in the narrative and marked on the drawings. The SWPPP narrative shall include documentation to explain and justify the pollution prevention decisions made for the project. Each of the 13 elements listed below must be considered and included in the SWPPP unless site conditions render the element unnecessary and the exemption from that element is clearly justified in the narrative of the SWPPP.

Clearing and grading activities for developments shall be permitted only if conducted pursuant to an approved site development plan (e.g., subdivision approval) that establishes permitted areas of clearing, grading, cutting, and filling. These permitted clearing and grading areas and any other areas required to preserve critical or sensitive areas, buffers, native growth protection easements, or tree retention areas, shall be delineated on the site plans and the development site.

The SWPPP shall be implemented beginning with initial land disturbance and until final stabilization. Sediment and erosion control BMPs shall be consistent with the BMPs contained in Chapter 4 of Volume II of the SWMMWW.

Seasonal Work Limitations. From October 1st through April 30th, clearing, grading, and other soil disturbing activities may only be authorized if silt-laden runoff will be prevented from leaving the site through a combination of the following:

(A) Site conditions including existing vegetative coverage, slope, soil type and proximity to receiving waters; and

(B) Limitations on activities and the extent of disturbed areas; and

(C) Proposed erosion and sediment control measures.

The following activities are exempt from the seasonal clearing and grading limitations:

(A) Routine maintenance and necessary repair of erosion and sediment control BMPs;

(B) Routine maintenance of public facilities or existing utility structures that do not expose the soil or result in the removal of the vegetative cover to soil; and

(C) Activities where there is 100 percent infiltration of surface water runoff within the site in approved and installed erosion and sediment control facilities.

Construction Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) Elements.

(A) Preserve Vegetation/Mark Clearing Limits.

(I) Before beginning land disturbing activities, including clearing and grading, clearly mark all clearing limits, sensitive areas and their buffers, and trees that are to be preserved within the construction area.

(II) Retain the duff layer, native top soil, and natural vegetation in an undisturbed state to the maximum degree practicable.

(B) Establish Construction Access.

(I) Limit construction vehicle access and exit to one route, if possible.

(II) Stabilize access points with a pad of quarry spalls, crushed rock, or other equivalent BMPs, to minimize tracking of sediment onto public roads.

(III) Locate wheel wash or tire baths on site, if the stabilized construction entrance is not effective in preventing tracking sediment onto roads.

(IV) If sediment is tracked off site, clean the affected roadways thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently as necessary (for example, during wet weather). Remove sediment from roads by shoveling, sweeping, or pick up and transport the sediment to a controlled sediment disposal area.

(V) Conduct street washing only after sediment is removed in accordance with subsection (1)(b)(iii)(B)(IV) of this section.

(VI) Control street wash wastewater by pumping back on site, or otherwise prevent it from discharging into systems tributary to waters of the state.

(C) Control Flow Rates.

(I) Protect properties and waterways downstream of development sites from erosion and the associated discharge of turbid waters due to increases in the velocity and peak volumetric flow rate of stormwater runoff from the project site.

(II) Where necessary to comply with subsection (1)(b)(iii)(C)(I) of this section, construct stormwater retention or detention facilities as one of the first steps in grading. Assure that detention facilities function properly before constructing site improvements (e.g., impervious surfaces).

(III) If permanent infiltration ponds are used for flow control during construction, protect these facilities from siltation during the construction phase.

(D) Install Sediment Controls.

(I) Design, install, and maintain effective erosion controls and sediment controls to minimize the discharge of pollutants.

(II) Construct sediment control BMPs (sediment ponds, traps, filters, etc.) as one of the first steps in grading. These BMPs shall be functional before other land disturbing activities take place.

(III) Minimize sediment discharges from the site. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment controls must address factors such as the amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site.

(IV) Direct stormwater runoff from disturbed areas through a sediment pond or other appropriate sediment removal BMP, before the runoff leaves a construction site or before discharge to an infiltration facility. Runoff from fully stabilized areas may be discharged without a sediment removal BMP, but must meet the flow control performance standard in subsection (1)(b)(iii)(C)(I) of this section.

(V) Locate BMPs intended to trap sediment on site in a manner to avoid interference with the movement of juvenile salmonids attempting to enter off-channel areas or drainages.

(VI) Where feasible, design outlet structures that withdraw impounded stormwater from the surface to avoid discharging sediment that is still suspended lower in the water column.

(E) Stabilize Soils.

(I) Stabilize exposed and unworked soils by application of effective BMPs that prevent erosion. Applicable BMPs include, but are not limited to: temporary and permanent seeding, sodding, mulching, plastic covering, erosion control fabrics and matting, soil application of polyacrylamide (PAM), the early application of gravel base on areas to be paved, and dust control.

(II) Control stormwater volume and velocity within the site to minimize soil erosion.

(III) Control stormwater discharges, including both peak flow rates and total stormwater volume, to minimize erosion at outlets and to minimize downstream channel and stream bank erosion.

(IV) Soils must not remain exposed and unworked for more than the time periods set forth below to prevent erosion:

• During the dry season (May 1st through September 30th): seven days;

• During the wet season (October 1st through April 30th): two days.

(V) Stabilize soils at the end of the shift before a holiday or weekend if needed based on the weather forecast.

(VI) Stabilize soil stockpiles from erosion, protect with sediment trapping measures, and where possible, locate away from storm drain inlets, waterways and drainage channels.

(VII) Minimize the amount of soil exposed during construction activity.

(VIII) Minimize the disturbance of steep slopes.

(IX) Minimize soil compaction and, unless infeasible, preserve topsoil.

(F) Protect Slopes.

(I) Design and construct cut-and-fill slopes in a manner to minimize erosion. Applicable practices include, but are not limited to, reducing continuous length of slope with terracing and diversions, reducing slope steepness, and roughening slope surfaces (for example, track walking).

(II) Divert off-site stormwater (run-on) or groundwater away from slopes and disturbed areas with interceptor dikes, pipes and/or swales. Off-site stormwater should be managed separately from stormwater generated on the site.

(III) At the top of slopes, collect drainage in pipe slope drains or protected channels to prevent erosion.

• Temporary pipe slope drains must handle the peak volumetric flow rate calculated using a 10-minute time step from a Type 1A, 10-year, 24-hour frequency storm for the developed condition. Alternatively, the 10-year one-hour flow rate predicted by an approved continuous runoff model, increased by a factor of 1.6, may be used. The hydrologic analysis must use the existing land cover condition for predicting flow rates from tributary areas outside the project limits. For tributary areas on the project site, the analysis must use the temporary or permanent project land cover condition, whichever will produce the highest flow rates. If using the Western Washington Hydrology Model to predict flows, bare soil areas should be modeled as “landscaped area.”

(IV) Place excavated material on the uphill side of trenches, consistent with safety and space considerations.

(V) Place check dams at regular intervals within constructed channels that are cut down a slope.

(G) Protect Drain Inlets.

(I) Protect storm drain inlets made operable during construction so that stormwater runoff does not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or treated to remove sediment.

(II) Clean or remove and replace inlet protection devices when sediment has filled one-third of the available storage (unless a different standard is specified by the product manufacturer).

(H) Stabilize Channels and Outlets.

(I) Design, construct, and stabilize all on-site conveyance channels to prevent erosion from the following expected peak flows:

• Channels must handle the peak volumetric flow rate calculated using a 10-minute time step from a Type 1A, 10-year, 24-hour frequency storm for the developed condition. Alternatively, the 10-year, one-hour flow rate indicated by an approved continuous runoff model, increased by a factor of 1.6, may be used. The hydrologic analysis must use the existing land cover condition for predicting flow rates from tributary areas outside the project limits. For tributary areas on the project site, the analysis shall use the temporary or permanent project land cover condition, whichever will produce the highest flow rates. If using the Western Washington Hydrology Model to predict flows, bare soil areas should be modeled as “landscaped area.”

(II) Provide stabilization, including armoring material, adequate to prevent erosion of outlets, adjacent stream banks, slopes, and downstream reaches at the outlets of all conveyance systems.

(I) Control Pollutants.

(I) Design, install, implement and maintain effective pollution prevention measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants.

(II) Handle and dispose of all pollutants including waste materials and demolition debris that occur on site in a manner that does not cause contamination of stormwater.

(III) Provide cover, containment, and protection from vandalism for all chemicals, liquid products, petroleum products, and other materials that have the potential to pose a threat to human health or the environment. On-site fueling tanks must include secondary containment. Secondary containment means placing tanks or containers within an impervious structure capable of containing 110 percent of the volume contained in the largest tank within the containment structure. Double-walled tanks do not require additional secondary containment.

(IV) Conduct maintenance, fueling and repair of heavy equipment and vehicles using spill prevention and control measures. Clean contaminated surfaces immediately following any spill incident.

(V) Discharge wheel wash or tire bath wastewater to a separate on-site treatment system that prevents discharge to surface water, such as closed-loop recirculation or upland application, or to the sanitary sewer, with city approval.

(VI) Apply fertilizers and pesticides in a manner and at application rates that will not result in loss of chemical to stormwater runoff. Follow manufacturers’ label requirements for application rates and procedures.

(VII) Use BMPs to prevent contamination of stormwater runoff by pH modifying sources. The sources for this contamination include, but are not limited to: bulk cement, cement kiln dust, fly ash, new concrete washing and curing waters, waste streams generated from concrete grinding and sawing, exposed aggregate processes, dewatering concrete vaults, concrete pumping and mixer washout waters.

(VIII) Adjust the pH of stormwater if necessary to prevent violations of water quality standards.

(IX) Assure that washout of concrete trucks is performed off site or in designated concrete washout areas only. Do not wash out concrete trucks onto the ground, or into storm drains, open ditches, streets, or streams. Do not dump excess concrete on site, except in designated concrete washout areas. Concrete spillage or concrete discharge to surface waters of the state is prohibited.

(X) Obtain written approval from Ecology before using chemical treatment other than CO2 or dry ice to adjust pH.

(J) Control De-Watering.

(I) Discharge foundation, vault, and trench de-watering water, which has similar characteristics to stormwater runoff at the site, into a controlled conveyance system before discharge to a sediment trap or sediment pond.

(II) Discharge clean, nonturbid de-watering water, such as well-point groundwater, to systems tributary to or directly into surface waters of the state, as specified in subsection (1)(b)(iii)(H) of this section provided the de-watering flow does not cause erosion or flooding of receiving waters. Do not route clean de-watering water through stormwater sediment ponds. Note that “surface waters of the state” may exist on a construction site as well as off site; for example, a creek running through a site.

(III) Handle highly turbid or otherwise contaminated de-watering water separately from stormwater.

(IV) Other treatment or disposal options may include:

(i) Infiltration.

(ii) Transport off site in vehicle, such as a vacuum flush truck, for legal disposal in a manner that does not pollute state waters.

(iii) Ecology-approved on-site chemical treatment or other suitable treatment technologies.

(iv) Sanitary or combined sewer discharge with city approval, if there is no other option.

(v) Use of a sedimentation bag that discharges to a ditch or swale for small volumes of localized de-watering.

(K) Maintain BMPs.

(I) Maintain and repair all temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control BMPs as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function in accordance with BMP specifications.

(II) Remove all temporary erosion and sediment control BMPs within 30 days after achieving final site stabilization or after the temporary BMPs are no longer needed.

(L) Manage the Project.

(I) Phase development projects to the maximum degree practicable and take into account seasonal work limitations.

(II) Inspection and Monitoring. Inspect, maintain, and repair all BMPs as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function.

(III) Maintaining an Updated Construction SWPPP. Maintain, update, and implement the SWPPP.

(IV) Projects that disturb one or more acres must have site inspections conducted by a certified erosion and sediment control lead (CESCL). Project sites disturbing less than one acre may have a CESCL or a person without CESCL certification conduct inspections. By the initiation of construction, the SWPPP must identify the CESCL or inspector, who must be present on site or on-call at all times.

(M) Protect Low Impact Development BMPs.

(I) Protect all bioretention and rain garden BMPs from sedimentation through installation and maintenance of erosion and sediment control BMPs on portions of the site that drain into the bioretention and/or rain garden BMPs. Restore the BMPs to their fully functioning condition if they accumulate sediment during construction. Restoring the BMP must include removal of sediment and any sediment-laden bioretention/rain garden soils, and replacing the removed soils with soils meeting the design specification.

(II) Prevent compacting bioretention and rain garden BMPs by excluding construction equipment and foot traffic. Protect completed lawn and landscaped areas from compaction due to construction equipment.

(III) Control erosion and avoid introducing sediment from surrounding land uses onto permeable pavements. Do not allow muddy construction equipment on the base material or pavement. Do not allow sediment-laden runoff onto permeable pavements or base materials.

(IV) Pavements fouled with sediments or no longer passing an initial infiltration test must be cleaned using procedures from the local stormwater manual or the manufacturer’s procedures.

(V) Keep all heavy equipment off existing soils under LID BMPs that have been excavated to final grade to retain the infiltration rate of the soils.

(c) Requirement No. 3 – Source Control of Pollutants. Source control BMPs prevent stormwater from coming in contact with pollutants. They are a cost-effective means of reducing pollutants in stormwater and, therefore, should be a first consideration in all projects. All multifamily residential, commercial, and industrial projects shall implement source control BMPs. Source control BMPs shall be selected, designed, and maintained in accordance with Volume IV of the adopted version of the SWMMWW.

(d) Requirement No. 4 – Preservation of Natural Drainage Systems and Outfalls. Natural drainage patterns shall be maintained, and discharges from the project site shall occur at the natural location, to the maximum extent practicable. The manner in which runoff is discharged from the project site shall not create any adverse impacts to downhill properties or drainage systems or downstream receiving waters as specified in the discharge requirements of the applicable stormwater or drainage manual. All outfalls require energy dissipation.

(e) Requirement No. 5 – On-Site Stormwater Management. Projects shall employ on-site stormwater management BMPs to infiltrate, disperse, and/or retain stormwater runoff on site to the maximum extent feasible without causing flooding or erosion impacts. Projects that are eligible for planning and approval under the requirements of the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual are required to utilize LID techniques for management of stormwater on site. Projects that are not eligible for planning and approval under the requirements of the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual are required to comply with the following. The application for proposed projects shall include an analysis of potential off-site drainage impacts associated with development of the proposed site and proposed BMPs for stormwater management including control of flows, runoff conveyance, and off-site discharge as required by the applicable stormwater or drainage manual. The requirements of an LID site analysis required for all projects that are not eligible to plan and permit under the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual are provided in subsection (6) of this section. Stormwater discharges shall match developed discharge durations to predeveloped durations for the range of predeveloped discharge rates from eight percent of the two-year peak flow to 50 percent of the two-year peak flow. Projects that must meet Requirement No. 7 shall match flow durations between eight percent of the two-year flow through the full 50-year flow.

Proposed projects that do not qualify for planning and permitting under the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual shall provide water quality treatment facilities to treat polluted surface and stormwater runoff generated by projects that meet the following criteria.

(i) Projects in which the total of pollution-generating hard surfaces (PGHS) is 5,000 square feet or more in a threshold discharge area of the project; or

(ii) Projects in which the total of pollution-generating pervious surfaces (PGPS) – not including permeable pavements – is three-quarters of an acre or more in a threshold discharge area, and from which there will be a surface discharge in a natural or manmade conveyance system from the site.

Treatment-Type Thresholds.

(A) Oil Control. Treatment to achieve oil control applies to projects that have “high-use sites.” High-use sites are those that typically generate high concentrations of oil due to high traffic turnover or the frequent transfer of oil. High-use sites include:

(I) An area of a commercial or industrial site subject to an expected average daily traffic (ADT) count equal to or greater than 100 vehicles per 1,000 square feet of gross building area;

(II) An area of a commercial or industrial site subject to petroleum storage and transfer in excess of 1,500 gallons per year, not including routinely delivered heating oil;

(III) An area of a commercial or industrial site subject to parking, storage or maintenance of 25 or more vehicles that are over 10 tons gross weight (trucks, buses, trains, heavy equipment, etc.);

(IV) A road intersection with a measured ADT count of 25,000 vehicles or more on the main roadway and 15,000 vehicles or more on any intersecting roadway, excluding projects proposing primarily pedestrian or bicycle use improvements.

(B) Phosphorus Treatment. The requirement to provide phosphorous control is determined by the city (e.g., through a lake management plan), or the Department of Ecology (e.g., through a waste load allocation). The city may have developed a management plan and implementing ordinances or regulations for control of phosphorus from new/redevelopment for the receiving water(s) of the stormwater drainage. The city can use the following sources of information for pursuing plans and implementing ordinances and/or regulations:

(I) Those water bodies reported under Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act, and designated as not supporting beneficial uses due to phosphorous;

(II) Those listed in Washington State’s nonpoint source assessment required under Section 319(a) of the Clean Water Act due to nutrients.

(C) Enhanced Treatment. Except where specified below under subsection (1)(f)(ii)(D) of this section, Basic Treatment, enhanced treatment for reduction in dissolved metals is required for the following project sites that: (I) discharge directly to fresh waters or conveyance systems tributary to fresh waters designated for aquatic life use or that have an existing aquatic life use; or (II) use infiltration strictly for flow control – not treatment – and the discharge is within one-quarter mile of a fresh water designated for aquatic life use or that has an existing aquatic life use:

Industrial project sites;

Commercial project sites;

Multifamily project sites; and

High AADT roads as follows:

Within urban growth management areas:

• Fully controlled and partially controlled limited access highways with annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts of 15,000 or more;

• All other roads with an AADT of 7,500 or greater.

Any areas of the above-listed project sites that are identified as subject to basic treatment requirements (below) are not also subject to enhanced treatment requirements. For developments with a mix of land use types, the enhanced treatment requirement shall apply when the runoff from the areas subject to the enhanced treatment requirement comprises 50 percent or more of the total runoff within a threshold discharge area.

(D) Basic Treatment. Basic treatment is required in the following circumstances:

(I) Project sites that discharge to the ground, unless:

1) The soil suitability criteria for infiltration treatment are met (see Chapter 3, Volume III of the SWMMWW), and alternative pretreatment is provided (see Chapter 6,Volume V of the SWMMWW); or

2) The project site uses infiltration strictly for flow control – not treatment – and the discharge is within one-quarter mile of a phosphorus sensitive lake (use a phosphorus treatment facility); or

3) The project site is industrial, commercial, multifamily residential, or a high AADT road (consistent with the enhanced treatment-type thresholds listed above) and is within one-quarter mile of a fresh water designated for aquatic life use or that has an existing aquatic life use (use an enhanced treatment facility);

(II) Residential projects not otherwise needing phosphorus control as designated by USEPA, the Department of Ecology, or by the city;

(III) Project sites discharging directly (or indirectly through a municipal separate storm sewer system) to basic treatment receiving waters (Appendix I-C of the SWMMWW);

(IV) Project sites that drain to fresh water that is not designated for aquatic life use, and does not have an existing aquatic life use; and project sites that drain to waters not tributary to waters designated for aquatic life use or that have an existing aquatic life use;

(V) Landscaped areas of industrial, commercial, and multifamily project sites, and parking lots of industrial and commercial project sites that do not involve pollution-generating sources (e.g., industrial activities, customer parking, storage of erodible or leachable materials, wastes or chemicals) other than parking of employees’ private vehicles. For developments with a mix of land use types, the basic treatment requirement shall apply when the runoff from the areas subject to the basic treatment requirement comprises 50 percent or more of the total runoff within a threshold discharge area.

Treatment Facility Sizing. Size stormwater treatment facilities for the entire area that drains to them, even if some of those areas are not pollution-generating, or were not included in the project site threshold decisions (Section 3 of Appendix I of the Western Washington Phase II Municipal Stormwater Permit) or the treatment threshold decisions of this minimum requirement.

Water Quality Design Storm Volume: The volume of runoff predicted from a 24-hour storm with a six-month return frequency (a.k.a. six-month, 24-hour storm). Wetpool facilities are sized based upon the volume of runoff predicted through use of the Natural Resource Conservation Service curve number equations in Chapter 2 of Volume III of the SWMMWW, for the six-month, 24-hour storm. Alternatively, when using an approved continuous runoff model, the water quality design storm volume shall be equal to the simulated daily volume that represents the upper limit of the range of daily volumes that account for 91 percent of the entire runoff volume over a multi-decade period of record.

Water Quality Design Flow Rate.

(I) Preceding Detention Facilities or When Detention Facilities Are Not Required. The flow rate at or below which 91 percent of the runoff volume, as estimated by an approved continuous runoff model, will be treated. Design criteria for treatment facilities are assigned to achieve the applicable performance goal (e.g., 80 percent TSS removal) at the water quality design flow rate. At a minimum, 91 percent of the total runoff volume, as estimated by an approved continuous runoff model, must pass through the treatment facility(ies) at or below the approved hydraulic loading rate for the facility(ies).

(II) Downstream of Detention Facilities. The water quality design flow rate must be the full two-year release rate from the detention facility.

Treatment Facility Selection, Design, and Maintenance. Stormwater treatment facilities shall be:

(I) Selected in accordance with the process identified in Chapter 4 of Volume I, and Chapter 2 of Volume V of the SWMMWW;

(II) Designed in accordance with the design criteria in Volume V of the SWMMWW; and

(III) Maintained in accordance with the maintenance schedule in Volume V of the SWMMWW.

Additional Requirements. The discharge of untreated stormwater from pollution-generating hard surfaces to groundwater must not be authorized by the city, except for the discharge achieved by infiltration or dispersion of runoff through use of on-site stormwater management BMPs in accordance with Chapter 5, Volume V and Chapter 7, Volume V of the SWMMWW; or by infiltration through soils meeting the soil suitability criteria in Chapter 3 of Volume III of the SWMMWW.

(g) Requirement No. 7 – Flow and Flow Duration Control. Projects must provide flow and flow duration control to reduce the impacts of stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces and land cover conversions. The requirement below applies to projects that discharge stormwater directly, or indirectly through a conveyance system, into one of the city’s lakes, wetlands, creeks, streams or other natural drainage systems. The applicant must apply on-site LID stormwater management techniques to the extent feasible. Flow control BMP design will be based on continuous hydrologic modeling analysis. The design will assure that flows will approximate, but in no case exceed, durations ranging from 50 percent of the two-year to the 50-year peak flow.

Thresholds. When assessing a project against the following thresholds, consider only those impervious, hard, and pervious surfaces that are subject to this minimum requirement as determined in the SWMMWW.

Projects that are not eligible for planning and approval under the Small Project Drainage Requirements and Technical Guidance Manual and exceed one of the following thresholds are required to achieve the standard flow control requirement for western Washington.

(i) Projects in which the total of effective impervious surfaces is 10,000 square feet or more in a threshold discharge area; or

(ii) Projects that convert three-quarter acre or more of vegetation to lawn or landscape, or convert two and one-half acres or more of native vegetation to pasture in a threshold discharge area, and from which there is a surface discharge in a natural or manmade conveyance system from the site; or

(iii) Projects that through a combination of hard surfaces and converted vegetation areas cause a 0.10-cubic-foot-per-second (cfs) increase or greater in the 100-year flow frequency from a threshold discharge area as estimated using the Western Washington hydrology model or other approved model and one-hour time steps (or a 0.15-cfs increase or greater using 15-minute time steps). The 0.10-cfs (one-hour time steps) or 0.15-cfs (15-minute time steps) increase should be a comparison of the post-project runoff to the existing condition runoff. For the purpose of applying this threshold, the existing condition is either the preproject land cover, or the land cover that existed at the site as of a date when the city first adopted flow control requirements into code or rules.

Standard Flow Control Requirement. Stormwater discharges shall match developed discharge durations to predeveloped durations for the range of predeveloped discharge rates from 50 percent of the two-year peak flow up to the full 50-year peak flow. The predeveloped condition to be matched shall be a forested land cover unless:

(i) Reasonable, historic information is available that indicates the site was prairie prior to settlement (modeled as “pasture” in the Western Washington hydrology model); or

(ii) The drainage area of the immediate stream and all subsequent downstream basins have had at least 40 percent total impervious area since 1985. In this case, the predeveloped condition to be matched shall be the existing land cover condition. The map in Appendix I-G of the SWMMWW depicts those areas which meet this criterion. Where basin-specific studies determine a stream channel to be unstable, even though the above criterion is met, the predeveloped condition assumption shall be the “historic” land cover condition, or a land cover condition commensurate with achieving a target flow regime identified by an approved basin study.

This standard requirement is waived for sites that will reliably infiltrate all the runoff from hard surfaces and converted vegetation areas.

Western Washington Alternative Requirement. An alternative requirement may be established through application of watershed-scale hydrological modeling and supporting field observations. Possible reasons for an alternative flow control requirement include:

(i) Establishment of a stream-specific threshold of significant bedload movement other than the assumed 50 percent of the two-year peak flow;

(ii) Zoning and land clearing ordinance restrictions that, in combination with an alternative flow control standard, maintain or reduce the naturally occurring erosive forces on the stream channel; or

(iii) A duration control standard is not necessary for protection, maintenance, or restoration of designated and existing beneficial uses or Clean Water Act compliance.

Additional Requirement. Flow control BMPs shall be selected, designed, and maintained in accordance with Volume III of the SWMMWW or an approved equivalent.

(h) Requirement No. 8 – Wetlands Protection. The requirements below apply only to projects whose stormwater discharges into a wetland, either directly or indirectly through a conveyance system.

Thresholds. The thresholds identified in Minimum Requirement No. 6 – Runoff Treatment and Minimum Requirement No. 7 – Flow Control shall also be applied to determine the applicability of this requirement to discharges to wetlands.

Standard Requirement. Projects shall comply with Guide Sheets No. 1 through No. 3 in Appendix I-D of the SWMMWW. The hydrologic analysis shall use the existing land cover condition to determine the existing hydrologic conditions unless directed otherwise by a regulatory agency with jurisdiction.

Additional Requirements. Stormwater treatment and flow control facilities shall not be built within a natural vegetated buffer, except for:

(i) Necessary conveyance systems as approved by the city; or

(ii) As allowed in wetlands approved for hydrologic modification and/or treatment in accordance with Guide Sheet 2 in Appendix I-D of the SWMMWW.

(i) Requirement No. 9 – Basin Planning. If a proposed project is in a designated critical drainage area, or is in an area included in an adopted master drainage plan, basin plan, lake management plan or shared facility plan, then the proposed project shall meet the applicable drainage requirements of the critical drainage area, master drainage plan, basin plan, lake management plan or shared facility plan. Provided the proposed methods of meeting Requirement No. 5, On-Site Stormwater Management, Requirement No. 6, Runoff Treatment, Requirement No. 7, Flow Control and/or Requirement No. 8, Wetlands Protection, demonstrate an equivalent level of treatment, flow control, and/or wetland protection through the construction and use of regional stormwater facilities.

(j) Requirement No. 10 – Operation and Maintenance. Maintenance of all drainage facilities in compliance with the city of Normandy Park maintenance standards is the responsibility of the applicant/property owner as described in the SWMMWW, except those facilities for which Normandy Park is granted an easement or covenant and assumes maintenance and operation as described in this chapter.

An operation and maintenance manual that is consistent with the provisions in Volume V of the SWMMWW for proposed stormwater facilities and BMPs is required. The party (or parties) responsible for maintenance and operation shall be identified in the operation and maintenance manual. For private facilities approved by the city, a copy of the operation and maintenance manual shall be retained on site or within reasonable access to the site, and shall be transferred with the property to the new owner. For public facilities, a copy of the operation and maintenance manual shall be retained in the appropriate department. A log of maintenance activity that indicates what actions were taken shall be kept and be available for inspection by the city.

(2) Engineering Required. All projects, except single-family residential projects with less than 5,000 square feet of total site impervious surface, are required to have a drainage plan prepared by an engineer licensed in the state of Washington. This requirement may be waived by the city engineer for projects with less than 10,000 square feet of total site impervious surface if the project design and conditions indicate a low likelihood of any adverse impacts due to a lack of professional involvement in the design.

(3) Financial Guarantees and Liability. All drainage facilities constructed or modified for projects, except for drainage improvements for single-family residential lots, must comply with the liability requirements of NPMC 13.08.100 and the financial guarantee requirements of NPMC 13.08.105.

(4) Landscaping and Aesthetics. Proposed projects shall incorporate landscape buffers and/or passive recreational features into the design of detention/retention and treatment facilities. The landscaping shall meet the landscaping requirements of the adopted stormwater manual. When possible, retention/detention facilities should be integrated into the project’s design to take advantage of the improved appearance and function of the facility.

(5) Adjustments. Adjustments to the technical requirements contained in an adopted drainage/stormwater manual may be proposed; provided, that the resulting development meets all applicable minimum requirements and conditions of this chapter; and provided, that granting the adjustment shall:

(a) Produce a compensating or comparable result in the public interest; and meet this chapter’s objectives of safety, function, appearance, environmental protection and maintainability based upon sound engineering judgment.

(b) Application of the standard specifications of an adopted manual will deny reasonable use of a property; the best practicable alternative shall be obtained as determined by the city engineer.

(c) Requests for adjustments that may be in conflict with the requirements of any other city of Normandy Park codes, ordinances, resolutions, interlocal agreements, or other laws shall require review and concurrence with those laws.

(d) Requests for adjustments shall be approved by the city engineer. Decisions on adjustments shall be determined within 60 days of receipt of the application. The 60-day review time may be extended if the city requires additional information from the applicant. If an adjustment is denied, the applicant may file for a variance from the requirements of this chapter as outlined in NPMC 13.08.340.

(6) LID Site Analysis Checklist.

(a) The site analysis requirements shall be submitted in addition to all other requirements for development approval for a project and may be submitted prior to the filing of other applications. The administrator may choose to waive certain components required in this section as appropriate based on the feasibility of a project site for LID.

(C) Twenty percent or greater slopes, 10-foot contours.

(D) Elevations shall be at 25-foot intervals.

(ii) A soils report prepared by a licensed geotechnical engineer or licensed engineering geologist. The report shall identify:

(A) Underlying soils on the site utilizing soil pits, soil grain analyses, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (shc) testing to assess infiltration capability on site. The frequency and distribution of soil pits and shc testing shall be adequate to direct placement of the roads, parking lots, and bioretention/rain gardens over those soils.

(B) Documentation of any possible shallow groundwater.

(iii) Preliminary drainage report consistent with the requirements of this code.

(A) Topologic features that may act as natural stormwater storage or conveyance and underlying soils that provide opportunities for storage and partial infiltration.

(B) Depth to groundwater.

(C) Geologic hazard areas and associated buffer.

(iv) A survey of the existing native vegetation cover by a licensed landscape architect, arborist, or qualified biologist identifying any forest areas on the site, species and condition of ground cover and shrub layer, and tree species, and canopy cover.

All drainage facilities constructed or modified for projects, except for private drainage improvements for single-family residential lots, must comply with these liability requirements. Except as specifically exempted herein, all projects shall maintain a general liability policy in an amount not less than $300,000 per individual, $500,000 per occurrence, and $1,000,000 property damage. The city manager may exempt certain projects from this requirement if the project is located entirely on private property and the project requires less than two acres of clearing and grading. (Ord. 955 § 2 (Exh. 2), 2017; Ord. 805 § 2, 2008).


13.08.105 Financial guarantees authorized.

The city is authorized to require all applicants issued permits or approvals under the provisions of this chapter to post financial guarantees consistent with the provisions of this chapter. All drainage facilities constructed or modified for projects, except for private drainage improvements for single-family residential lots, must comply with these financial guarantee requirements.

Except as specifically exempted herein, all projects shall be required to post a financial guarantee in an amount and type approved by the city manager. The city manager may exempt certain projects from this requirement if the project is located entirely on private property and the project requires less than two acres of clearing and grading. Prior to commencing construction, the person constructing a retention/detention or water quality facility shall post a performance surety in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of conforming the construction to the approved drainage plans. After determination by the city that all facilities are constructed in compliance with the approved plans, as-built drawings have been submitted and approved, and a maintenance and defect surety has been posted, the performance surety shall be released. After satisfactory completion of a retention/detention or water quality facility and release of the performance surety by the city, the person constructing such facility shall commence a two-year period of satisfactory maintenance and operation of the facility. A cash bond, to be used at the discretion of the city manager to correct deficiencies in that maintenance affecting public health, safety and welfare, must be posted and maintained throughout the two-year period. In addition, this cash bond shall cover the cost of defects or failures of the retention/detention or water quality facilities through the two-year period. (Ord. 955 § 2 (Exh. 2), 2017; Ord. 805 § 2, 2008).

These include, but are not limited to, adopted design manuals, permit application requirements, checklists and other forms associated with permitting.

(b) The city manager is authorized to develop procedures for applying adopted rules and regulations during the review of permit applications for the development of land. These procedures may also be contained in adopted design manuals.

(2) Inspections. The city manager is authorized to make such inspections and take such actions as may be required to enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(3) Right of Entry. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or monitor for proper function of drainage facilities, or whenever the city manager has reasonable cause to believe that violations of this chapter are present or operating on a subject property or portion thereof, the city manager may, subject to the provisions of this section, enter the premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the city manager by this chapter. Prior to making inspections on private property that is occupied, the city manager shall present identification and city credentials, state the purpose of the inspection, and request entry. If the property is not occupied, the city manager shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the premises or portion thereof and demand entry. If, after making reasonable efforts, the city manager is unable to locate the owner, occupant or other person having charge or control of the property and the city manager has reason to believe that the condition of the property creates an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment, the city manager may enter the property without obtaining permission. In the event that access is denied, or in the event that the city manager is unable to locate the owner, occupant or other person in charge or control of the property and the condition of the property is not an imminent hazard to life, property or the environment, the city manager may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a search warrant authorizing entry for purposes of carrying out the inspections provided for under this section.

(4) Access. Adequate ingress and egress shall be provided to the city manager to inspect, monitor or perform any duty imposed upon the city manager by this chapter. The city manager shall notify the responsible party in writing of failure to comply with this access requirement. Failing to obtain a response within seven days from the receipt of notification, the city manager may order the work required completed or otherwise address the cause of improper access. The obligation for the payment of all costs that may be incurred or expended by the city in causing such work to be done shall thereby be imposed on the person owning the subject property. (Ord. 955 § 2 (Exh. 2), 2017; Ord. 805 § 2, 2008).

(1) The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940; unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

(2) When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.

(3) When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

(4) If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the department of ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the city attorney at the direction of the city manager.

(5) Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the city manager and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement must approve the agreement.

(6) Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal (that is, which agencies require nonexempt licenses). (Ord. 439 § 6(Part 2 § 4), 1984).


13.12.060 Time considerations.

(1) For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or draft EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission.

(2) If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specification, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. (Ord. 439 § 6(Part 2 § 5), 1984).

Article III. Categorical Exemptions and Threshold Determinations


13.12.070 Adverse environmental impact.

This article contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a “probable significant, adverse environmental impact” requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This article also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference, as supplemented in this article:

WAC

197-11-300Purpose of this part;

197-11-305Categorical exemptions;

197-11-310Threshold determination required;

197-11-315Environmental checklist;

197-11-330Threshold determination process;

197-11-335Additional information;

197-11-340Determination of nonsignificance (DNS);

(Ord. 439 § 6(Part 3 § 1), 1984).


13.12.080 Exempt levels established.

(Note: This section is optional. The lowest exempt level in the ranges below apply unless the city raises the level based on local conditions, such as previous DNS’s on the activities or city development codes. The city may raise the level for an exemption to any point up to the maximum specified in WAC 197-11-800(1)(c); once levels are established in this chapter, the city must apply a level to all projects within the geographic area to which the level applies.)

(1) The city establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(b) based on local conditions:

(a) For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i): up to five dwelling units;

(b) For agricultural structures in WAC 197-11-800(l)(b)(ii): up to 10,000 square feet;

(c) For office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii): up to 4,000 square feet and up to 20 parking spaces;

(d) For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800 (1)(b)(iv): up to 20 parking spaces;

(e) For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800 (l)(b)(v): up to 100 cubic yards.

(2) Whenever the city establishes new exempt levels under this section, it shall send them to the Department of Ecology, Headquarters Office, Olympia, WA 98504 under WAC 197-11-800 (1)(c). (Ord. 439 § 6(Part 3 § 2), 1984).


13.12.090 Use of exemptions.

(1) Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal.

The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

(2) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

(3) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that: the city shall not give authorization for any action except as provided in WAC 197-11-050. (Ord. 439 § 6(Part 3 § 3), 1984).


13.12.100 Environmental checklist.

(1) A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.

(2) For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

(3) The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

(a) The city has technical information on a question(s) that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

(b) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 439 § 6(Part 3 § 4), 1984).


13.12.110 Mitigated DNS.

(1) As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the city manager may issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

(2) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(a) Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

(b) Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.

(3) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 15 working days. The response shall:

(a) Be written;

(b) State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS; and

(c) State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.

(4) As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

(5) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

(a) If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a determination of nonsignificance under WAC 197-11-340(2);

(b) If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DN or DS as appropriate;

(c) The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent stormwater runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200 foot stormwater retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

(d) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

(6) Mitigated DNS’s issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), require a 14-day comment period and public notice.

(7) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. 

(8) If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS). 

(9) The city’s written response under subsection (2) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. (Ord. 706 § 1, 2003; Ord. 439 § 6(Part 3 § 5), 1984).

(2) Environmental Impact Statement.

(a) When the city is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS and the city manager determines that the EIS shall be prepared by employees of the city, the city may charge and collect a reasonable fee from any applicant to cover costs incurred by the city in preparing the EIS. The city manager shall advise the applicant(s) of the projected costs for the EIS prior to actual preparation; the applicant shall post bond or otherwise ensure payment of such costs.

(b) The city manager may determine that the city will contract directly with a consultant for preparation of an EIS, or a portion of the EIS, for activities initiated by some persons or entity other than the city, and may bill such costs and expenses directly to the applicant. Such consultants shall be selected by mutual agreement of the city and applicant after a call for proposals. The city may require the applicant to post bond or otherwise ensure payment of such costs.

(c) If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the city manager shall refund any fees collected under subdivisions (a) or (b) of this subsection which remain after incurred costs are paid.

(3) The city may collect a reasonable fee from an applicant to cover the cost of meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the applicant’s proposal.

(4) The city shall not collect a fee for performing its duties as a consulted agency.

(5) The city may charge any person for copies of any document prepared under this chapter, and for mailing the document, in a manner provided by Chapter 42.17 RCW. (Ord. 699 § 2, 2003; Ord. 439 § 6(Part 10 § 3), 1984).

(Ord. 955 § 3 (Exh. 3), 2017; Ord. 555 § 12, 1992).


13.20.130 Operating conditions and standards of performance.

(1) Cuts and fills shall conform to the following provisions unless otherwise approved by the code official:

(a) Slope. No permanent slope, cut or fill surface shall be steeper than two to one (2:1) unless approved by the code official, based upon a geotechnical report prepared by a licensed professional engineer.

(b) Fill Location. Fill slopes shall not be constructed on natural slopes steeper than two to one (2:1).

(c) Preparation of Ground. The ground surface shall be prepared to receive fill by removing vegetation, noncomplying fill, topsoil and unsuitable materials, scarifying to provide a bond with the new fill and, where slopes are steeper than five to one (5:1), and the height is greater than five feet, by benching into sound bedrock or other competent material. The bench under the toe of a fill on a slope steeper than five to one (5:1) shall be at least 10 feet wide. The area beyond the toe of the fill shall be sloped for sheet overflow or a paved drain shall be provided. Where fill is to be placed over a cut, the bench under the toe of the fill shall be at least 10 feet wide but the cut must be made before placing fill and approved by the code official as suitable foundation for fill. Unsuitable soil is soil which, in the opinion of the city engineer is not competent to support other soil or fill, to support structures or to satisfactorily perform the other functions for which the soil is intended.

(d) Erosion-Sedimentation Control. All disturbed areas including faces of cut-and-fill slopes shall be prepared and maintained to control erosion and sedimentation. This control shall consist of those management practices in a Temporary Erosion-Sedimentation Control Plan (TESCP) that meet the standards of the city as approved by the code official. These practices shall be implemented as specified in the plan. Where areas are not subject to erosion, as determined by the code official, such protection may be omitted.

(e) Fill Material. 

(i) Only earthen material which has more than minor amounts of organic material or has rock or similar irreducible material with a maximum dimension greater than 12 inches shall not be buried or placed in fills.

EXCEPTION: The code official may permit placement of larger rock when a professional engineer retained by the applicant devises a method of placement, continuously inspects its placement and approves the fill stability.

(ii) The following conditions shall also apply:

(A) Prior to issuance of the permit, potential rock disposal areas shall be delineated on the grading plan; and

(B) Rock sizes greater than 12 inches in maximum dimension shall be 10 feet or more below grade, measured vertically; and

(C) Rocks shall be placed so as to assure filling of all voids with fines.

(f) Compaction. All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent of maximum density as determined by UBC Standard No. 70-1. Field density shall be determined in accordance with USC Standard No. 70-2 or equivalent as approved by the code official.

(g) Slope. The slope of fill surfaces shall be no steeper than is safe for the intended use. Fill slopes shall be no steeper than two to one (2:1).

(h) Bench Terrace. Benches at least six feet in width shall be back sloped and shall be established at no more than 30-foot vertical intervals to control surface drainage and debris. Swales or ditches on benches shall have a maximum gradient of one percent.

(i) Drainage. Provisions shall be made to prevent any surface water or seepage from damaging the cut face of any excavations or the sloping face of a fill, and to carry any surface waters that are or might be concentrated as a result of a fill or excavation to a natural watercourse or other means as approved by the code official. Erosion of ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of nonerosive downdrains or other devices approved by the code official, and as further specified in Chapter 13.08 NPMC.

(j) Subsurface Drainage. Cut-and-fill slopes shall be provided with subsurface drainage as necessary for stability.

(k) Peak Discharge of Surface Water. Provisions shall be made so as to not generate peak discharge of surface water from the site of more than that equivalent to its preexisting natural condition, in accordance with Chapter 13.08 NPMC.

(l) Access Roads. Roads to grading sites shall be located and maintained to minimize problems of erosion, dust, mud, and traffic circulation.

(m) Hazardous Conditions. Signs warning of hazardous conditions, if such exist, shall be affixed at clearly visible locations.

(n) Fencing. Where required by the code official to protect life, limb and property, fencing shall be closed and locked when the site is not being attended. The fence must be six feet in height and the fence material shall have no horizontal opening larger than two inches.

(o) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1)(o)(i) of this section, areas that have been cleared and graded shall have the soil moisture-holding capacity restored to at least that of the original undisturbed soil native to the site to the maximum extent practicable. The preferred hierarchy of soil protection is as follows: (1) leave native soils undisturbed and protect from compaction; (2) stockpile site duff and topsoil and reapply to site after grading activities; (3) amend existing soil in-place; (4) import topsoil mix.

The soil in any area that has been compacted or that has had some or all of the duff layer or underlying topsoil removed shall be mitigated per the hierarchy listed above for lost moisture-holding capacity. These activities shall take place between May 1st and October 1st unless approved by the director of community planning. Replaced topsoil shall be a minimum of eight inches thick, unless the applicant demonstrates that a different thickness will provide conditions equivalent to the soil moisture-holding capacity native to the site. Replaced topsoil shall have an organic matter content of between eight to 13 percent dry weight and a pH suitable for the proposed landscape plants.

(i) This subsection does not apply to areas that:

(A) Are subject to a state surface mine reclamation permit; or

(B) At project completion are covered by an impervious surface, incorporated into a drainage facility or engineered as structural fill or slope.

(2) All operations, conditions and standards of performance shall be subject to the limitations of the permits. (Ord. 955 § 3 (Exh. 3), 2017; Ord. 804 § 1, 2008; Ord. 720 § 4, 2003; Ord. 555 § 13, 1992).

(b) The wall is placed on a slope of 10 percent or greater.

(c) The wall retains fill over three feet in depth.

(d) The wall height from bottom of footing to top of wall is over four feet.

(2) Setbacks from property lines to retaining walls are required for permitted walls, and recommended for walls not requiring a permit. The minimum setback for retaining walls to the nearest property line is six inches. Standard setbacks are given in Table 1:

Table 1 

	Wall Height	Setback Distance

	Under 3 feet 	1 foot

	3 – 4 feet	2 feet

	4 – 12 feet	Height/2

	Over 12 feet	Additional requirements may apply

(3) Setback Reduction and Elimination. Standard setbacks in Table 1 may be reduced to the minimum setback of six inches or eliminated under the following conditions:

(a) The city determines that the minimum six-inch setback is sufficient under the specific site conditions to avoid impacts to neighboring properties and the public.

(b) A retaining wall between two property owner’s properties is desired by both parties and there is a recorded easement on each side of the retaining wall equal to or larger than the standard setback to each other property owner, or a recorded maintenance agreement is entered into by both parties, or is otherwise provided during plat creation.

(4) Drainage. A wall drain must be provided for all walls over four feet in height.

(5) Landscaping. Walls over eight feet in height require landscaping to obscure large wall area. (Ord. 955 § 3 (Exh. 3), 2017; Ord. 864 § 5, 2010).

Pursuant to RCW 35.92.021, the amount of the rate adjustment shall be determined by the city based upon the cost of the activities to the school district but not to exceed the value of the activity to the stormwater management program. Determination of which activities qualify for the service charge reduction will be made by the city. Reductions in service charges will only be granted to public school districts which provide programs that have been evaluated by the city. The rate adjustment for the school district activity may be applied to any parcel in the service area which is owned or operated by the school district; or

(c) The service charge bill was otherwise not calculated in accordance with this article.

(3) Single-family residential parcels owned by a public benefit nonprofit corporation authorized under RCW 24.03.490 which provide activities or services directly benefiting the public shall be capped at not more than six equivalent residential units; provided, that a request for rate adjustment has been submitted to the city manager.

(4) Appeal of Impervious Surface Area Determination. If a property owner feels that the city erred in classifying a portion of the parcel’s land area as impervious surface, the landowner may submit test data or other information that shows the land area in question is in fact pervious.

(5) The property owner shall have the burden of proving that the rate adjustment sought should be granted.

(6) Decisions on requests for rate adjustments shall be made by the city manager based on information submitted by the applicant within 30 days of the adjustment request except when additional information is needed. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the city’s decision. If an adjustment is granted which reduces the charge for the current year, the applicant shall be refunded the amount overpaid in the current year. Prior to refund, all outstanding fees to the city must be paid in full.

(7) If the city manager finds that a service charge bill has been undercharged, then an amended bill shall be issued which reflects the increase in the service charge. The city may include in the bill the amount undercharged for two previous billing years in addition to the current bill.

(8) Appeals. Any customer or property owner who feels that the surface water drainage service charge for their property has been incorrectly calculated or applied, and/or that credits have not been properly granted may petition, in writing to the city manager, for a review of said calculations, application or credit. If not satisfied with the determination of the city manager, the petitioner may appeal to the city council. Any credits authorized by the appeal process shall only be against billings subsequent to the date the appeal is filed. (Ord. 779 § 3, 2008; Ord. 719 § 4, 2003).

Electrical wiring added to an existing service, feeder, or branch circuit shall not result in an installation that violates the provisions of the code in force at the time the additions were made.

Minor additions, alterations, renovations and repairs to existing mechanical systems shall meet the provisions for new construction, unless such work is done in the same manner and arrangement as was in the existing system, is not hazardous, and is approved by the building official.

Exceptions:

1. Additions constructed under the International Residential Code with less than 500 square feet of conditioned floor area are exempt from the requirements for whole house ventilation systems, IRC Section M1508.

2. Additions or alterations to existing buildings constructed under the International Residential Code, which do not require the construction of foundations, crawlspaces, slabs or basements, shall not be required to meet the requirements for radon protection in IRC Section R327.1 and Appendix F.

If the owner or party in interest, following exhaustion of the rights to appeal, fails to comply with the final order to repair, alter, improve, vacate, close, remove, or demolish the dwelling, building, structure, or premises, the code official may direct or cause such dwelling, building, structure, or premises to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, and closed, removed, or demolished.

The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements; or vacating and closing; or removal or demolition by the building official is authorized to be assessed against the real property upon which such cost was incurred unless such amount is previously paid. Upon certification by the city of the assessment amount being due and owing, the county treasurer shall enter the amount of such assessment upon the tax rolls against the property for the current year and the same shall become a part of the general taxes for that year to be collected at the same time and with interest at such rates and in such manner as provided for in RCW 84.56.020, as now or hereafter amended, for delinquent taxes, and when collected to be deposited to the credit of the general fund of the city. If the dwelling, building, structure, or premises is removed or demolished by the city, the city is authorized to, if possible, sell the materials of such dwelling, building, structure, or premises, and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition, and if there be any balance remaining, it shall be paid to the parties entitled thereto, as determined by the city, after deducting the costs incident thereto.

The assessment shall constitute a lien against the property which shall be of equal rank with state, county and municipal taxes. (Ord. 857 § 13 (Exh. D), 2010).


14.40.180 Stop work order.

(1) Authority. Whenever the code official finds any work regulated by this code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this code or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the code official is authorized to issue a stop work order. Issuance of a notice of violation, infraction or notice and order is not a condition precedent to the issuance of the stop work order.

(2) Issuance. A stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, to the owner’s agent, or to the person doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order and the conditions under which the cited work is authorized to resume.

(3) Emergencies. Where an emergency exists, the code official shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work.

(4) Effect.

(a) The code official is authorized to assess a special investigation fee for the issuance of a stop work order when work has started without the issuance of a permit. The special investigation fee shall be determined in accordance with NPMC 14.05.375(5), Work Commencing Before Permit Issuance.

(b) A stop work order represents a determination that a civil code violation has occurred and that any work or activity that is causing or contributing to the violation on the property where the violation has occurred or is occurring must cease.

(c) A stop work order requires the immediate cessation of the specified work or activity on the named property. Work or activity may not resume unless specifically authorized by the building official or designee.

(d) A stop work order may be appealed to the city of Normandy Park hearings examiner according to the procedures prescribed by NPMC 14.40.170, Means of appeal.

(e) Failure to appeal the stop work order within the applicable time limits renders the stop work order a final determination that the civil code violation occurred and that work was properly ordered to cease.

(f) Failure to comply with the terms of a stop work order subjects the person responsible for code compliance to civil penalties and costs.

(5) Remedy – Civil Penalties. Any person who shall continue any work in or about the structure after having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be subject to penalties as prescribed by law.

(a) In addition to any other judicial or administrative remedy, the code official or designee may assess penalties for the violation of any stop work order as set forth in NPMC 14.40.095(4), Penalties.

(b) Penalties for the violation of any stop work order shall begin to accrue on the first day the stop work order is violated and shall cease on the day the work is actually stopped.

(c) Violation of a stop work order shall be a separate violation from any other civil code violation. Civil penalties assessed create joint and several personal obligations in all persons responsible for code violation. The city of Normandy Park may collect the civil penalties assessed by any appropriate legal means.

(d) In addition to all other remedies, a lien for the value of the civil penalties imposed may be filed against the real property that is subject to compliance with this title. (Ord. 857 § 13 (Exh. D), 2010).

16.04.010 Purpose and responsibility.

(1) The Shoreline Management Act of 1971 was adopted in 1972 (Chapter 90.58 RCW). It is the policy of the state to provide for the management of the shorelines of the state by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses. This policy is designed to ensure the development of these shorelines in a manner which, while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in the navigable waters, will promote and enhance the public interest. This policy contemplates protecting against adverse effects to the public health, the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the waters of the state and their aquatic life, while protecting generally public rights of navigation and corollary rights incidental thereto.

(2) Primary responsibility for shoreline regulation and planning is given to local governments with the Department of Ecology acting in a review and watchdog capacity. Where a local shoreline is part of a designated “shoreline of statewide significance,” as in the case of areas seaward of extreme low tide in Normandy Park, local governments are required to give priority to statewide objectives and goals enumerated in RCW 90.58.020 for that portion of the shoreline so designated. The department, in adopting guidelines for shorelines of statewide significance, and the local government, in developing master programs for shorelines of statewide significance, shall give priority to uses in the following order of preference which:

(a) Recognize and protect the statewide interest over local interests;

(b) Preserve the natural character of the shoreline; 

(c) Result in long-term over short-term benefit;

(d) Protect the resources and ecology of the shoreline;

(e) Increase public access to publicly owned areas of the shorelines;

(f) Increase recreational opportunities for the public; and

(g) Provide for any other element as defined in RCW 90.58.100 deemed appropriate or necessary.

Shoreline master programs (SMPs) serve as standards for implementation of state policy set forth in Chapter 90.58 RCW for regulation of shoreline uses. The master programs articulate local policies and use regulations governing the physical development of land and water resources affecting shorelands. These regulations are in addition to other ordinances, rules and regulations of the city. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.04.020 Area of jurisdiction.

(1) The shoreline area covered by the Normandy Park SMP is approximately three miles along Puget Sound, which is a shoreline of statewide significance (see Appendix A, Map of Shoreline Designations (Figure 1)). The entire shoreline area is designated under five environments: rural residential environment, urban conservancy, beach community, bluff conservancy, and aquatic. The shoreline extends from the Des Moines/Normandy Park city limits on the south to approximately SW 176th Street on the north at the Burien/Normandy Park border. The eastern (shoreward) boundary is 200 feet landward of the ordinary high water mark. The western (seaward) boundary is the minus 100-foot underwater contour (generally, 400 feet seaward of the ordinary high water mark).

(2) In accordance with the 1972 Shoreline Management Act as amended in 2006, that portion of the Normandy Park shoreline area between the extreme low water mark and the minus 100-foot contour (which is permanently underwater) is a publicly owned area of statewide significance where statewide shoreline interests take precedence over local shoreline interests. Extensive tidelands are exposed at low tide all along the Normandy Park shoreline, which are primarily held by private landowners. Marine View Park is city-owned and provides the only public access to those publicly owned shorelands which by definition remain underwater. Private recreational opportunities also exist for property owners living within tract 611750TRCT (referred to as Lot A) at the Normandy Park Cove. 

(3) Unless specifically exempted by statute, all proposed uses and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to Chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act, and this master program, whether or not a permit is required. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.04.030 Compliance in Normandy Park.

(1) Since 1974 the Normandy Park shoreline area has been controlled by the 1973 Normandy Park shoreline master program. The area extending from SW 208th Street to the city of Des Moines has been regulated by the King County Shoreline Master Program of 1977. The overall goal of the SMP is to control and regulate future development as it affects the shoreline area, ensuring that the private sector’s right to use does not infringe upon the public’s right to enjoy and use the shoreline of Puget Sound without having to trespass on private uplands or tidelands. In recognition of the limitations of the natural environment, shoreline development activities and uses are to be regulated in a manner that assures shoreline uses with minimal adverse environmental effects and that preserves unique natural resources and shoreline features having historic, cultural, scientific, and educational value.

(2) The Shoreline Management Act sets forth three primary tasks to be fulfilled by local governments:

(a) Administration of a shoreline permit system for proposed substantial development on wetlands of designated water bodies.

(b) Compilation of a comprehensive inventory which includes a survey of natural characteristics, present land uses, and patterns of property ownership.

(c) Development of a master program to provide an objective guide for regulating the use of shorelines.

(3) The Normandy Park shoreline master program (SMP) refers to the city’s comprehensive plan, zoning code and other development plans and ordinances for which this SMP has relevance. SMP use regulations are, however, a legally separate and stand-alone set of regulations enabled by the Shoreline Management Act of 1971 or as amended thereafter (Chapter 90.58 RCW).

(4) Development within the shoreline area must conform to the city’s general requirements and the SMP. In case of conflict, the stricter requirement applies.

(5) Under the SMP, a permit must be obtained from the city for any proposed substantial development within Normandy Park shoreline.

(6) “Substantial development,” according to the Act, means any development where the total cost or fair market value exceeds $6,400, or the current dollar threshold determined by the state as described in WAC 173-27-040(2)(a), whichever is greater, or any development that would interfere with the normal public use of the water or shorelines.

(7) However, any development which occurs within the city’s shoreline area, as shown in Appendix A, Map of Shoreline Designations (Figure 1), and as defined by the Act, whether it requires a permit or not, must be consistent with the intent of the Act. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.04.040 Citizen involvement.

(1) With assistance from local residents, the current master program was developed between 2009 and 2013 as an update of the previous SMP in order to incorporate shorelines annexed by the city since 1973 and to reflect recent changes in state requirements and community preferences. The program presents a description of natural processes, an enumeration of objectives and policies for shoreline development, designation of shoreline environment(s), use regulations, and provisions for variances, conditional uses, unclassified uses, and updating the SMP.

(2) During a three-year period, the technical advisory committee and the city council reviewed and accepted citizen input to this Normandy Park shoreline master program. Citizen input was solicited and received from local newspaper articles, public meetings, phone calls and discussions with residents by the citizen advisory committee, planning commission, and city council meeting discussions. Based on this participation, it is felt that this resulting SMP represents the wishes of the citizens of Normandy Park within the constraints of existing federal, state, and city laws and regulations. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.04.045 References to plans, regulations or information sources.

Critical areas within the city’s shoreline jurisdiction should be managed and protected to ensure no net loss of ecological functions. When feasible, restore degraded ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes.

Where the critical areas regulations or flood damage prevention regulations conflict with other parts of the SMP, the requirement that most supports the provisions of the SMA as stated in RCW 90.58.020 shall apply, as determined by the shoreline administrator.

(1) The Normandy Park critical areas ordinance, Chapter 18.36 NPMC, is hereby adopted in whole as a part of this program, except the following sections shall not apply within shoreline jurisdiction:

(a) NPMC 18.36.100, Partial exemptions;

(b) NPMC 18.36.120, Reasonable use exception; 

(c) NPMC 18.36.160, Mitigation sequencing;

(d) NPMC 18.36.220, Subdivisions, short subdivisions, planned unit developments and binding site plans;

(e) NPMC 18.36.640(7), Allowed Uses. The following specific activities may be permitted within a habitat conservation area, pond, lake, water of the state, or associated buffer when the activity complies with the following standards and the adopted shoreline master program and all unavoidable impacts are fully mitigated;

(f) NPMC 18.36.530(2)(B)(ii): allows buffer reduction to 10 feet in geologically hazardous areas; and

(g) NPMC 18.36.640(8), Coastal Bulkheads. 

(2) These revisions to the Critical Areas Code apply and supersede Chapter 18.36 NPMC:

(a) NPMC 18.36.110, Single-Family Residence Administrative Exception. When the single-family residence exceptions provisions of NPMC 18.36.110 are utilized for a project proposal, a shoreline variance permit is required.

(b) NPMC 18.36.310(1). Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter and consistent with WAC 173-22-035.

(c) NPMC 18.36.310(2), Wetlands Classification. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Hruby 2014; Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised). Buffer reductions in excess of 25 percent of the standard buffer width require a shoreline variance permit. 

(d) NPMC 18.36.330(3). Buffers on Category IV wetlands will be 40 feet.

(e) NPMC 18.36.330(3)(f) and (g) and 18.36.640(4)(d) and (e). Buffer width reductions will be allowed to no more than 25 percent of the standard buffer width.

(f) NPMC 18.36.330(2)(a). Category III and IV wetlands have no minimum size and no wetlands are exempt from development regulations and this SMP.

(g) NPMC 18.36.340(3)(c)(iii), Decreased Replacement Ratio. The proposed mitigation actions are conducted at least two years in advance of the impact and have been shown to be successful. 

(h) NPMC 18.36.340(6), Selecting Compensation Sites. Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

(i) NPMC 18.36.340(8), Alternative Compensation Projects. 

(i) NPMC 18.36.340(8)(e). Conducting compensation as part of a cooperative process does not reduce or eliminate the required replacement ratios outlined above. 

(ii) NPMC 18.36.340(8)(f). Prior to selling mitigation credits to other parties, the compensation site(s) sponsor must have received all of the required state and federal approvals to sell credits as a mitigation bank or in-lieu fee site.

(3) The following sections of Chapter 9.02 NPMC, Construction in Flood Hazard Areas, are hereby adopted in whole as a part of this program: NPMC 9.02.170 (Floodways) and 9.02.180 (Wetlands management).

(4) The following subsections of the Flood Hazard Reduction, WAC 172-26-221(3)(c), are adopted into this program: 

(a) Allow new structural flood hazard reduction measures in shoreline jurisdiction only when it can be demonstrated by a scientific and engineering analysis that they are necessary to protect existing development, that nonstructural measures are not feasible, that impacts on ecological functions and priority species and habitats can be successfully mitigated so as to assure no net loss, and that appropriate vegetation conservation actions are undertaken consistent with WAC 173-26-221(5).

(b) Place new structural flood hazard reduction measures landward of the associated wetlands, and designated vegetation conservation areas, except for actions that increase ecological functions, such as wetland restoration, or as noted below. Provided that such flood hazard reduction projects be authorized if it is determined that no other alternative to reduce flood hazard to existing development is feasible. The need for, and analysis of feasible alternatives to, structural improvements shall be documented through a geotechnical analysis.

All references to the critical areas ordinance (CAO), Chapter 18.36 NPMC, are for this specific version. Where conflict between this shoreline master program occurs with other regulations, the more restrictive regulation applies. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.04.050 Master program goals.

The city of Normandy Park, by establishing its master program, intends to control and regulate future development as it affects the shoreline area, ensuring that the private sector’s right to use does not infringe upon the public’s right to enjoy and use the shorelines of Puget Sound without having to trespass on private uplands or tidelands. Shoreline development, in recognition of the limitations of the natural environment, will be regulated to assure that shoreline uses preserve the quality of the environment for the benefit of existing and future generations and the public interest. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.04.060 Master program organization.

The shoreline master program is documented in Chapter 16.08 NPMC through Appendix A and contains: Definitions (16.08), Shoreline Environmental Designation (16.12), Master Program Policy Elements (16.16), Use Regulations (16.20), User’s Guide to Program Administration (16.24) and Appendix A: Map of Shoreline Designations (Figure 1). (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).

16.08.110 Community dock.

“Community dock” means structures which abut the shoreline and are used as landing or moorage places for watercraft and which serve up to 10 lots or parcels. Docks serving more than 10 lots are considered marinas. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.08.120 Conditional use.

“Conditional use” means a use, development, or substantial development which is classified as a conditional use or is not classified within the master program. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.08.125 Critical saltwater habitat.

Critical saltwater habitats include all kelp beds, eelgrass beds, spawning and holding areas for forage fish, such as herring, smelt and sandlance; mudflats, intertidal habitats with vascular plants, and areas with which priority species have a primary association. Critical saltwater habitats require a higher level of protection due to the important ecological functions they provide. Ecological functions of marine shorelands can affect the viability of critical saltwater habitats. (WAC 173-26-221(2)(iii)(A)). (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.08.130 Department.

16.08.155 Drift cell.

“Drift cell,” “drift sector,” or “littoral cell” means a particular reach of marine shore in which littoral drift may occur without significant interruption and which contains any natural sources of such drift and also accretion shore forms created by such drift. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.08.160 E.I.S. 

“E.I.S.” means environmental impact statement as provided in Chapter 43.21C RCW. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.08.170 Extreme low water.

“Extreme low water” means the lowest line on the land reached by a receding tide. (Ord. 539 § 2, 1991). 


16.08.175 Fair market value.

“Fair market value” means the expected price at which the development can be sold to a willing buyer. For developments which involve nonstructural operations such as dredging, drilling, dumping, or filling, the fair market value is the expected cost of hiring a contractor to perform the operation or, where no such value can be calculated, the total of labor, equipment use, transportation, and other costs incurred for the duration of the permitted project. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991. Formerly 16.08.180).


16.08.180 Feeder bluff.

“Feeder bluff” means a coastal bluff that, as a result of its natural erosion, delivers sand and gravel to the beach that is subsequently transported by waves and currents along the shoreline to maintain beaches and accretion shoreforms elsewhere within the local drift cell. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.08.185 Fill.

“Fill” means the addition of soil, sand, rock, gravel, sediment, earth retaining structure, or other material to an area waterward of the OHWM, in wetlands, or on shorelands in a manner that raises the elevation or creates dry land. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.08.190 Groins.

“Groins” means wall-like structures built seaward from the shore to build or preserve an accretion beach by trapping littoral sand drift on the updrift side. Generally narrow and of varying lengths, groins may be built along the shore. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.08.200 Height.

“Height” means the distance measured from average grade level to the highest point of a structure; provided, that appurtenances such as television antennas and chimneys shall not be used in calculating height, except where they obstruct the view of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining such shorelines. Temporary construction equipment is excluded from these calculations. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.08.210 Jetties.

“Jetties” means structures generally built singly or in pairs perpendicular to the shore at harbor entrances or river mouths to prevent the shoaling or accretion of littoral sand drift.

16.12.030    Beach community.


16.12.001 Shorelines of statewide significance.

The State of Washington Shoreline Management Act (SMA) designates certain shoreline areas as shorelines of statewide significance. These shorelines are considered important major resources from which all people in the state derive benefit. The SMA states that local shoreline master programs must give preference to uses which favor public and long-term interests of the people of the state. In the city of Normandy Park, only the marine shorelines waterward of extreme low tide are designated shorelines of statewide significance. The lower portions of Miller and Walker Creeks where flow is equal to or exceeds 20 cubic feet per second are “shorelines of the state” and are not “shorelines of statewide significance.” The following policies apply to Normandy Park’s shoreline areas: 

(1) Recognize and protect the statewide interest over local interest. 

(2) Preserve the natural character of the shoreline. 

(3) Result in long-term over short-term benefit. 

(4) Protect the resources and ecology of the shoreline. 

(5) Increase public access to publicly owned areas of the shoreline. 

(6) Increase recreational opportunities for the public on the shoreline. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.12.005 Shoreline environment designation map.

The shoreline designation map, Appendix A, Map of Shoreline Designations (Figure 1), establishes the general locations of each of the shoreline designations within the city of Normandy Park. This map generally illustrates the extent of shoreline jurisdiction, but is only a depiction that will need to be reviewed and determined case-by-case based on the relevant definitions in the SMA. In the event that there are any undesignated shorelines of the state, they will be automatically designated urban conservancy under this SMP. If any part of a proposed development or activity is located within this shoreline designation, the entire proposal must be reviewed for consistency with the city of Normandy Park’s shoreline master program. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.12.010 Rural residential environment.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of the rural residential environment is to restrict intensive development along single-family residential shorelines and to maintain open spaces and opportunities for recreational uses compatible with residential uses. Protection of the natural shoreline environment and its resources is encouraged. 

(2) Criteria for Designation. The rural residential environment designation is an area of low to medium density single-family residential development and some public and private recreational uses. The area is free from intensive development and does not include any multifamily residential, commercial, or industrial development. Planned residential developments may be allowed by the city of Normandy Park. The rural residential environment includes sensitive areas such as steep slopes, eroding bluffs, stream deltas, heavily wooded areas, and flood zones.

(3) Management Policies.

(a) New developments in the rural residential environment should reflect the character of the surrounding area by limiting residential density, providing permanent open space, and by maintaining adequate building setbacks from the water.

(b) Public and private recreational facilities and uses compatible with residential uses should be encouraged.

(c) Water-dependent, water-related, or water-enjoyment recreational activities should be encouraged on publicly owned property.

(d) Public access opportunities should be encouraged to publicly owned shorelines without having to trespass on private upland or tideland properties.

(e) Intensive development such as multifamily residential, commercial, ports, and industrial development should not be permitted.

(f) Low density residential development should be allowed when supporting community facilities such as public sewer, water and power are available.

(g) Residential developments and recreational uses should be located, sited, designed, and maintained to protect and enhance the shoreline environment.

(h) Construction of structural shoreline stabilization should be permitted for bank protection; provided it is designed so that it will not result in significant damage to neighboring properties. New developments should be designed to preclude the need for such stabilization and should be compatible with existing shoreline characteristics and limitations. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.12.015 Aquatic.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of the aquatic shoreline environment designation is to protect, restore, and manage the unique characteristics and resources of shoreline areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark including the shoreline-designated portions of Miller and Walker Creeks, Puget Sound, and adjacent wetlands. This is accomplished by managing water dependent uses and modifications to: 

(a) Preserve/restore ecological functions of the nearshore area; 

(b) Preserve critical saltwater and freshwater habitat; 

(c) Provide public access and recreation opportunities; and

(d) Assure compatibility between shoreland and aquatic uses.

(2) Criteria for Designation. An aquatic shoreline environment designation is assigned to lands waterward of the ordinary high water mark for both saltwater and freshwater bodies of water, including any submerged or intertidal areas. For the city of Normandy Park, this designation applies to the portions of Miller and Walker Creeks and adjacent wetlands that meet the criteria for a shoreline of the state (RCW 90.58.030(2)(f)) and marine areas (Puget Sound) waterward of the ordinary high water mark half the distance to Vashon Island. The aquatic shoreline environment designation includes the water surface together with the underlying lands and the water column. 

(3) Management Policies. 

(a) Shoreline uses and modifications should be compatible with the adjoining shoreline environment and designed and managed to prevent degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions. 

(b) New or reconstructed overwater structures should be allowed only for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration if it can be clearly shown that the cumulative environmental impacts of such structures will not cause significant adverse impacts to protected species. 

(c) The size of new or reconstructed overwater structures should be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use and should support multiple uses. 

(d) All developments and uses on navigable waters or their beds should be located and designed to minimize interference with surface navigation and moorage. 

(e) All developments and uses should consider impacts to public views and access and allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration. 

(f) Restoration opportunities associated with project impacts should be encouraged in the aquatic environment. 

(g) Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical saltwater and freshwater habitats should not be allowed except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020 (Shoreline Management Act), and then only when their impacts are mitigated according to the sequence described in WAC 173-26-201(2)(e) (Environmental Impact Mitigation) necessary to achieve no net loss of ecological functions. 

(h) Shoreline uses and modifications should be designed and managed to prevent degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.12.020 Urban conservancy.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of the urban conservancy shoreline environment designation is to protect and restore ecological functions of open space, floodplains, and other sensitive lands where they exist in urban and developed settings, while allowing a variety of compatible uses. This designation focuses on providing access for the enjoyment of marine and lake shorelines by allowing the development of recreational facilities. 

(2) Criteria for Designation. An urban conservancy environment designation is assigned to areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are suitable for public (including community access and unlimited general access) or private access, water-enjoyment recreational uses, and active recreation developments. These are areas that are developed at a low density including outdoor recreation. The urban conservancy environment is designated for Marine View Park and a portion of the mouth of Miller and Walker Creeks (see Appendix A, Map of Shoreline Designations (Figure 1)). 

(3) Management Policies. 

(a) Uses that preserve or restore the natural character of the shoreline area or promote preservation of open space and critical areas should be the primary allowed uses. 

(b) Public and private access and public and private recreation objectives should be implemented if feasible and wherever any significant ecological impacts can be mitigated. 

(c) Water-oriented uses should be given priority over non-water-oriented uses, with water-dependent uses given the highest priority. 

(d) New development should be designed and located to preclude the need for shoreline armoring, vegetation removal, flood control, and other shoreline modifications. 

(e) Standards should be established for shoreline stabilization measures, vegetation conservation, water quality, and shoreline modifications. These standards shall ensure that new development or redevelopment does not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or further degrade other shoreline values. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.12.025 Bluff conservancy.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of the bluff conservancy environment is to protect those shoreline areas that are steep feeder bluffs that are relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions sensitive of human use. This designation is meant to be an overlay over rural residential designation where single-family residences are on top of feeder bluffs. These systems require that only very low-intensity uses be allowed in order to maintain the ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes. Restoration of the shoreline and shoreline functions, where feasible and permitted under the Normandy Park Code, is encouraged in this environment.

(2) Criteria for Designation.

(a) Bluff conservancy environment designation should be assigned to shoreline areas if any of the following characteristics apply:

(i) The shoreline is undeveloped and contains feeder bluff habitat and therefore is currently performing an important, irreplaceable function or ecosystem-wide process that would be impaired by human activity.

(ii) The shoreline is unable to support new development or uses without significant adverse impacts to ecological functions or risk to human safety.

(iii) Uses in the bluff conservancy include low impact recreation and natural resource-based, low-intensity activities.

Such shoreline areas include largely undisturbed portions of shoreline areas such as wetlands, estuaries, unstable bluffs, coastal dunes, spits, and ecologically intact shoreline habitats.

“Ecologically intact shorelines,” as used here, means those shoreline areas that retain the majority of their natural shoreline functions, as evidenced by the shoreline configuration and the presence of native vegetation. Generally, but not necessarily, ecologically intact shorelines are free of structural shoreline modifications, structures, and intensive human uses. In forested areas, they generally include native vegetation with diverse plant communities, multiple canopy layers, and the presence of large woody debris available for recruitment to adjacent water bodies. Recognizing that there is a continuum of ecological conditions ranging from near-natural conditions to totally degraded and contaminated sites, this term is intended to delineate those shoreline areas that provide valuable functions for the larger aquatic and terrestrial environments which could be lost or significantly reduced by human development or have risk to human safety if they were developed. Whether or not a shoreline is ecologically intact is determined on a case-by-case basis.

The term “ecologically intact shorelines” applies to all shoreline areas meeting the above criteria ranging from larger reaches that may include multiple properties to small areas located within a single property.

(3) Management Policies.

(a) Any use that would degrade the ecological functions or natural character of the shoreline area should not be allowed.

(b) The following new uses should not be allowed in the “bluff conservancy” environment:

(i)  Residential development.

(ii) Commercial uses.

(iii) Non-water-oriented recreation.

(iv) Industrial uses.

(v) Non-water-oriented recreation.

(vi) Roads, utility corridors, and parking areas that can be located outside of bluff conservancy designated shorelines.

(vii) All other uses prohibited by this SMP.

(c) No development shall be allowed that requires shoreline stabilization structures, except for lots where existing civil settlements by and between the city require them.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the SMP or Normandy Park Code, existing shoreline stabilization structures may be allowed to remain and be maintained, subject to approval by the city. Where existing shoreline stabilization measures are allowed to be repaired or rebuilt, soft-armoring should be used where feasible to protect ecological functions and be consistent with the purpose of this environment. Rebuilt shoreline stabilization measures shall be placed above the ordinary high water mark, where feasible.

(e) Scientific, historical, cultural, educational research uses, and low-intensity water-oriented recreational access uses may be allowed; provided, that no significant ecological impact on the area will result.

(f) Development or significant vegetation removal that would reduce the capability of vegetation to perform normal ecological functions should not be allowed. The subdivision of property in a configuration that, to achieve its intended purpose, will require significant vegetation removal or shoreline modification that adversely impacts ecological functions is not allowed. That is, each new parcel must be able to support its intended development without significant ecological impacts to the shoreline ecological functions. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.12.030 Beach community.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of the beach community environment is to recognize the unique community of single-family residential uses and to protect the safety of the residences while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions in areas that have been previously degraded, where feasible. The beach community environment would maintain open spaces and opportunities for recreational uses compatible with the beach residential uses. Protection of the natural shoreline environment and its resources is encouraged. Due to the potential for damage to structures in this designation and the physical constraints to repair and redevelopment, removal of structures, restoration of the natural shoreline, and change of use to conservation is encouraged.

The following identifies the objectives for the beach community designation in order of importance:

(a) Protect the unique characteristics of these communities while minimizing the impact to critical areas and natural shoreline processes;

(b) Accommodate the functional re-use of residential structures and safety of its residences; and

(c) Encourage restoration of natural shoreline, removal of all structures, or placing properties in conservation where residential structures and property have been substantially damaged.

(2) Criteria for Designation. The beach community designation is an area largely occupied by the collection of unique single-family residences and seasonal single-family residences. Some residences are located on the beach and are prone to storm damage. The area is free from intensive development and does not include any multifamily residential, commercial, or industrial development. The beach community designation includes sensitive areas such as beaches, steep slopes, eroding feeder bluffs, heavily wooded areas, and flood zones.

(3) Management Policies.

(a) When substantial redevelopment or development activities occur on parcels in this environment, septic systems must be abandoned and the houses must be connected to the Southwest Suburban Sewer System within the city or the Midway Sewer System in Des Moines, Washington.

(b) Public access opportunities should be encouraged to publicly owned shorelines without having to trespass on private upland or tideland properties.

(c) Intensive development such as multifamily residential, commercial, ports, and industrial development should not be permitted. Additional residential development in this environment is not encouraged.

(d) Construction or reconstruction of shoreline stabilization measures should be permitted for bank protection and residential safety, provided it is designed so that it will not result in significant damage to neighboring properties, and would not result in net loss of ecological functions. New developments should be designed to preclude the need for such stabilization and should be compatible with existing shoreline characteristics and limitations. 

(e) Substantially damaged residences are encouraged to change use of their property to conservation instead of rebuilding with the intent of allowing preservation or restoration of ecological functions.

(f) For redevelopment activities, the applicant must comply with NPMC 16.20.185 and 16.20.190 and also establish a covenant per NPMC 16.20.190(1)(a)(xiv). (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).

16.16.010 Generally.

(1) The Shoreline Management Act of 1971 identifies seven land and water use elements to be addressed in the development of area-wide shoreline goals. They include: economic development, public access, circulation, recreation, shoreline use, conservation, and historical/cultural. Master programs are also encouraged to include any other elements which, because of present uses or future needs, are deemed appropriate to effectuate the policy of the Act. Therefore, because of the predominantly residential nature of Normandy Park, a residential element has been incorporated.

(2) The following comprehensive set of shoreline goals provides the foundation and framework on which the balance of the master program has been developed. Citizens, administration, and governmental officials of the city have established the following goals and associated objectives and policies which reflect the level of achievement believed to be desirable for all city shoreline uses, needs, and developments. They have also established program policies commensurate with the intent and objectives of the Shoreline Management Act. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.16.020 Shoreline use element.

This element addresses the distribution, location, and extent: 

(1) The use of shorelines and adjacent areas for housing, transportation, public buildings, utilities, education, and natural resources; 

(2) The use of the water for aquaculture, recreation, and transportation; and 

(3) The use of the water, shoreline, and uplands for categories of land and water uses and activities not specified in this master program.

Goal: Preserve or develop shorelines in a manner that assures shoreline uses with minimal adverse effect on the quality of the environment. Also, consider the goals, objectives, and policies within this shoreline master program in all land use management actions regarding the use or development of adjacent uplands and all streambeds within the city’s jurisdiction where such use or development may have an adverse effect on shorelines.

Objective: Provide for the clustering of like water-related and water-dependent shoreline uses.

Policy 1. Unique and fragile areas of the shoreline shall be protected from uses or activities that may have an adverse effect on the land or water environment.

Policy 2. Nonresidential uses or activities designed for water-related and water-enjoyment uses (which are not shoreline dependent) shall be encouraged to locate or relocate away from the shoreline.

Policy 3. Normandy Park shall consider the goals, objectives, and policies within the shoreline master program in all land use management actions regarding the use or development of water areas, adjacent uplands, and associated wetlands or streams, with less than 20 cubic feet per second mean annual flow within its jurisdiction, where such use or development may have an adverse effect on designated shorelines.

Policy 4. New construction, except shoreline stabilization structures, shall have a minimum setback of 115 feet landward from the OHWM, except for sensitive areas (e.g., eroding bluffs or shores, marshes, bogs, swamps, and streams) where setbacks shall be managed from the top of the bluff or nearest wetland edge per setbacks defined in Chapter 18.36 NPMC.

Policy 5. No new construction, except a shoreline stabilization structure, which significantly reduces the flood storage capacity of the streambed or increases flood hazards to upstream properties or otherwise endangers public safety, shall be allowed within the limits of the 100-year floodplain, unless reasonable flood and ecological protection is provided.

Policy 6.

Based upon the shoreline goals and policies in this program, the following regulations are established for all shoreline use and use elements. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.030 Agriculture.

For the purposes of the Normandy Park master program, agricultural practices refer to all methods of livestock, crop, vegetation and soil management. Essentially, all agricultural activities include some source of nonpoint water pollution. Eight characteristic pollution types require special controls: sediment, nutrient, additives, pesticides, herbicides, salt loads, organic loads, and microbial (pathogens).

(1) Commercial agriculture is prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.040 Aquaculture.

“Aquaculture” means the culture, harvesting or farming of food fish, shellfish, or other aquatic plants and animals. Sport fishing is not considered an aquaculture activity. Aquaculture activities include the hatching, cultivating, planting, feeding, raising, harvesting, and processing of aquatic plants and animals and the maintenance and construction of necessary equipment, buildings and growing areas. Aquaculture also includes restoration activities that support life of fish and shellfish including, but not limited to, restoration of eelgrass beds and forage fish habitat. Aquaculture does not include the harvest of wild geoduck associated with the state managed wildstock geoduck fishery.

(1) Policies.

(a) Future commercial aquaculture uses are not anticipated within the city’s shoreline jurisdiction due to poor water quality and potential conflicts with navigation, and shall be considered on a case-by-case basis through a shoreline conditional use permit. 

(b) Aquaculture should not be permitted in areas where it would result in a net loss of ecological functions, adversely impact critical saltwater habitats, eelgrass and macroalgae, or significantly conflict with existing adjacent uses. 

(c) Aquacultural facilities, if permitted within the Normandy Park shoreline, must be designed and located so as not to spread disease to native aquatic life, establish new nonnative species which cause significant ecological impacts, or significantly impact the aesthetic qualities of the shoreline.

(d) Aquaculture for the purpose of research or restoration and enhancement of native species is encouraged and shall be considered on a case-by-case basis through a shoreline conditional use permit. 

(e) Noncommercial aquaculture for the purposes of personal consumption may be allowed on a case-by-case basis and must comply with all applicable elements of the SMP and state and federal regulations, and does not require a permit unless structures are used. When structures are used, a conditional use permit may be required.

(2) Management Policies.

(a) Aquatic environment – Commercial aquaculture is allowed with a CUP. Aquaculture for the purposes of personal consumption (subsistence) is allowed when no structures are involved. A conditional use permit shall be required when structures are used for aquaculture for personal consumption.

(b) Urban and bluff conservancy environments – Commercial aquaculture is prohibited. Aquaculture for the purposes of research and restoration and enhancement is allowed with a CUP. Aquaculture for the purposes of personal consumption is prohibited.

(c) Rural residential and beach community environments – Commercial aquaculture is prohibited. Aquaculture for the purposes of research and restoration and enhancement is allowed with a conditional use permit. Aquaculture for the purposes of personal consumption is allowed when no structures are used. A conditional use permit shall be required when structures are used for aquaculture for personal consumption.

(3) Regulations.

(a) Aquaculture is not permitted in areas where it would result in a net loss of ecological functions in or damage to critical saltwater habitats (e.g., eelgrass) as defined in NPMC 16.08.125, or significantly conflict with navigation and other water-dependent uses.

(b) No aquatic organism shall be introduced into city of Normandy Park shoreline areas without the prior written approval of the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife or the appropriate regulatory agency for the specific organism.

(c) Aquaculture for the purposes of restoration in support of fish, shellfish, and/or other aquatic animals, and/or aquatic plants, may be allowed if a conditional use permit is granted by Normandy Park and written approval has been provided by Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife or the appropriate regulatory agency for the specific activity. 

(d) A wastewater plant is operated by the Southwest Sewer District and discharges into the combined mouths of Miller and Walker Creeks. Another wastewater plant is operated by Midway Sewer District and is located in Des Moines, Washington. These plants frequently discharge raw sewage into the creeks and Puget Sound during large storm events or power failures. This discharge is not compatible with aquaculture due to the levels of contaminants discharged into Puget Sound. Any aquaculture that would provide a food source for humans except for the purposes of restoration is prohibited within one-half mile of wastewater treatment plant outfall in order to protect the safety of the public from contamination due to the wastewater effluent. 

(e) The rights of treaty tribes to aquatic resources within their usual and accustomed areas shall be addressed through direct coordination between the project proponent and the affected tribe(s).

(f) All aquaculture must comply with all state and federal policies, regulations and permits, including Chapter 173-26 WAC, Part III and Chapter 173-27 WAC, and all applicable policies and provisions of this SMP.

(g) All aquaculture must comply with the city’s noise, litter, and nuisance ordinances.

(h) All aquaculture that is allowed within the shoreline must avoid or mitigate impacts and comply with the mitigation sequencing in NPMC 18.36.160 and 18.36.170 and WAC 173-26-201(2)(e).

(4) Application Requirements and Permits Administration.

(a) Aquaculture permits shall expire five years after approval and apply to all subsequent planting, harvesting, restocking and ongoing operations during that time period. Renewals shall expire 10 years after approval and shall be administered consistent with WAC 173-27-100.

(b) Geoduck application requirements and administration of permits shall be consistent with WAC 173-26-241(3)(b)(ii), (iii), and (iv). (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.050 Forest practices.

(1) Forest practices are activities relating to the growing, harvesting or processing of timber, including but not limited to: 

(a) Site preparation for regeneration; 

(b) Protection from insects, fire and disease; 

(c) Silvicultural practices such as thinning, release from competing vegetation, and fertilization; and 

(d) Harvesting, including the engineering and road construction necessary for logging and administrative access.

(2) Commercial forest practices are prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.060 Mining.

For the purposes of the Normandy Park master program, mining is the removal of naturally occurring materials from the earth for economic use. Many valuable deposits of sand and gravel are located on the marine shoreline. The conflicts between economic interest and environmental concern in these situations are obvious.

(1) Mining is prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.070 Commercial boating facilities.

Boating facilities include marinas, boat launch ramps, and other commercial boating facilities.

(1) “Disposal” means the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of any solid or hazardous waste on any land area or in the water. Solid waste includes all putrescible and nonputrescible solid and semisolid wastes, including garbage, rubbish, ashes, industrial wastes, wood wastes, demolition and construction wastes, abandoned vehicles and parts of vehicles and other discarded commodities. Solid waste does not include composting, sewage, dredge spoil, or common residential gardening practices (see use regulations for landfill, dredging, etc.).

(2) Solid waste disposal can be a threat to health and safety wherever it occurs, but it poses particular problems in shoreline areas. Not only is it a physical and visual blight, but leachate from solid waste disposal can contaminate waters, thus endangering public health and wildlife.

(a) No solid waste disposal is permitted on the shorelines of Normandy Park. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.115 Monitoring devices.

“Monitoring devices” means devices used within the aquatic designation or shoreline above the OHWM for restoration, restoration monitoring, water quality monitoring, or improvement of ecological functions. 

(1) Use of devices for monitoring is subject to a conditional use permit. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.20.120 Breakwaters.

Breakwaters are off-shore structures often linked to the shore, designed to absorb and reflect the energy of waves so as to protect the shore behind them. They are generally constructed either as solid walls, which tend to be most effective in reducing wave energy behind the structure, or as floating structures which often are not sufficient to withstand waves of high energy. Because beach accumulation and general sand mobility is caused by wave, current and tidal action, breakwaters may have dramatic effects on beach formation and sand movement. Solid breakwaters generally have a greater impact on sand movement than floating breakwaters.

(1) Breakwaters are prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.130 Dredging.

Repealed by Ord. 940. (Ord. 539 § 2, 1991). 


16.20.140 Accretion beach (beach that accretes sediment).

An accretion beach is a beach that has been created or is growing by a process that involves the accretion or gradual deposition of sand.

(1) Development on accreted beaches is prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.150 Transportation facilities.

Transportation facilities include roads, driveways, and bridges.

(1) Transportation facilities are prohibited in the following areas:

(a) Steep slopes, eroding bluffs or areas subject to severe erosion or landslide hazard;

(b) In front of feeder bluffs, over driftways, or on accretion shoreforms;

(c) In the aquatic, bluff conservancy, and urban conservancy environments.

(2) Sidecastings of excess road materials are prohibited within the shoreline area of Normandy Park. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.160 Residential development over water.

Development of residences over water or within floodways.

(1) Residential development over water, including floating homes, is prohibited in Normandy Park.

(2) Nonresidential development is prohibited within floodways. 

(3) Any development over water or within floodways is also subject to Chapter 9.02 NPMC, Construction in Flood Hazard Areas. In the event of any conflict between the SMP and these regulations, the regulations that provide the greatest protection of shorelines shall prevail. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.170 Jetties.

Jetties are structures constructed primarily to affect the movement of sand. Jetties are constructed of rock, steel, or concrete and located at the mouths of streams to prevent sand from blocking channels and hindering navigation. The effect of jetties is to obstruct the sand contained in the littoral drift. Jetties direct it away from navigation routes. Where there is a relatively small amount of sand available in the littoral drift, this type of structure may tend to starve areas downdrift.

(1) Jetties are prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.175 Mooring buoys.

A recreational mooring buoy is a device used to tie up a boat and typically consists of a line from the boat attached to a float at the water’s surface with a cable or line fixed underwater to the submerged ground. The anchor line allows the boat to float and swing around the fixed buoy anchor.

(1) Mooring buoys are permitted in the aquatic environment and only if they comply with the Washington Department of Natural Resources regulations. 

(2) Only one mooring buoy per residence is permitted. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).

Article III. General Regulations


16.20.180 Generally.

Based upon the shoreline goals and policies in Chapter 16.16 NPMC and this chapter, the following regulations are established for all shoreline use activities. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.185 General development standards.

The following general development standards apply to all uses and activities in all shoreline environments: 

(1) Impact Mitigation. 

(a) To the extent Washington State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (SEPA), Chapter 43.21C RCW, is applicable, the analysis of environmental impacts from proposed shoreline uses or developments shall be conducted consistent with the rules implementing SEPA (Chapter 13.12 NPMC and Chapter 197-11 WAC). Mitigation for adverse impacts to shoreline functions will be triggered during the SEPA review, shoreline land use permit process, or exemption approval process. 

(b) Where required, mitigation measures shall be applied in the following sequence of steps listed in order of priority: 

(i) Avoid the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 

(ii) Minimize impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts; 

(iii) Rectify the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment; 

(iv) Reduce or eliminate the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations; 

(v) Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and

(vi) Monitor the impact and the compensation projects and take appropriate corrective measures. 

(c) In determining appropriate mitigation measures applicable to shoreline development, lower priority measures shall be applied only where higher priority measures are determined to be infeasible or inapplicable. 

(d) Required mitigation shall not be in excess of that necessary to assure that proposed uses or development will result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. 

(e) Mitigation actions shall not have a significant adverse impact on other shoreline functions fostered by the policy of the Shoreline Management Act. 

(f) When compensatory measures are appropriate pursuant to the mitigation priority sequence above, preferential consideration shall be given to measures that replace the impacted functions directly and are located in the immediate vicinity of the impact. However, alternative compensatory mitigation may be authorized if said mitigation occurs within the watershed and addresses limiting factors or identified critical needs for shoreline conservation based on watershed or comprehensive management plans. Authorization of compensatory mitigation measures may require appropriate safeguards, terms, or conditions as necessary to ensure no net loss of ecological functions. 

(2) Water Quality/Stormwater. All activities and development within the shoreline jurisdiction shall incorporate water pollution control measures and best management practices (BMPs) for stormwater management. Such measures shall address both temporary impacts to water quality from construction activities as well as the need for permanent stormwater management facilities in compliance with the requirements and restrictions of all applicable city and state regulations. 

(3) Critical Areas. Activities and development in critical areas found within shoreline jurisdiction are required to comply with the development standards outlined in Chapter 18.36 NPMC, Critical Areas (Ordinance #825 (April 2009), and Chapter 9.02 NPMC, Construction in Flood Hazard Areas. 

(a) Any conflict between the standards outlined in Chapter 18.36 NPMC or Chapter 9.02 NPMC and the SMP shall be resolved in favor of the standard that is most protective of the shoreline ecological functions.

(4) Critical Salmonid Habitats. All saltwater shorelines in Normandy Park are critical salmonid habitats. Activities and development in critical salmonid habitats found within the shoreline jurisdiction are required to comply with the following development standards, in addition to those contained in other sections of this chapter: 

(a) Structures which prevent the migration of salmon and steelhead are prohibited. Fish bypass facilities shall allow the upstream migration of adult fish. Fish bypass facilities shall prevent fry and juveniles migrating downstream from being trapped or harmed. 

(b) Shoreline modification structures may intrude into critical salmonid habitats only where the proponent demonstrates all of the following conditions are met: 

(i) An alternative alignment or location is not feasible.

(ii) The project is designed to minimize its impacts on the environment. 

(iii) If the project will create unavoidable adverse impacts, the impacts are mitigated by creating in-kind replacement habitat near the project. Where in-kind replacement mitigation is not feasible, rehabilitating degraded habitat may be required as a substitute. 

(iv) The project satisfies all provisions of NPMC 16.20.200, Shoreline modification activities. 

(c) Open pile bridges are the preferred water crossing structures over critical salmonid habitats. If a bridge is not feasible, one of the following water crossing structures may be approved if the impacts can be mitigated: temporary culverts, bottomless arch culverts, elliptical culverts, or other fish-passable round culverts. These structures are listed in priority order, with the first having the highest preference and the last the lowest preference. In order for a lower priority structure to be permitted, the applicant must show the higher priority structures are not feasible. The project shall be designed to minimize its impacts on the environment. 

(d) Dredging in critical salmonid habitats shall not be allowed unless the proponent demonstrates all of the following conditions are met: 

(i) The dredging is for a water-dependent or water-related use. 

(ii) An alternative alignment or location is not feasible. 

(iii) The project is designed to minimize its impacts on the environment. 

(iv) The project is in the public interest. 

(v) The project is for ecological and salmon habitat restoration purposes.

(vi) If the project will create significant unavoidable adverse impacts, then the impacts are mitigated by creating in-kind replacement habitat near the project. Where in-kind replacement mitigation is not feasible, rehabilitating degraded habitat may be required as a substitute. 

(e) In-water dredge spoil disposal sites shall not be located in critical salmonid habitats. 

(f) Filling, dumping, discharging commercial or industrial waste water (including discharging of stormwater), dredging, channelization, draining, flooding, disturbing the water level or duration of inundation or water tables, and other activities which negatively impact habitat are prohibited in wetlands, ponds, and side channels which are associated with critical salmonid habitats. 

(g) Within critical salmonid habitats, permanent channel changes and realignments are prohibited, unless approved by WDFW for restoration purposes. 

(h) The removal of aquatic and riparian vegetation within or adjacent to critical salmonid habitats shall be minimized. Trees which shade side channels, streams, estuaries, ponds, and wetlands associated with critical salmonid habitats shall be maintained consistent with the provisions of this chapter. Areas of disturbed earth shall be revegetated. 

(i) Unless removal is needed to prevent hazards to life and property or to enhance critical salmonid habitats, large woody debris below the ordinary high water mark shall be left in the water to provide salmon and steelhead habitat.

(5) Restoration Projects. 

(a) Restoration projects within the shoreline environment consistent with WAC 173-27-080(2)(o) shall be allowed without a shoreline substantial development permit; be reviewed through the shoreline exemption review process; and be designed consistent with the development standards outlined in Chapter 18.36 NPMC, Critical Areas Development Regulations, and Chapter 9.02 NPMC, Construction in Flood Hazard Areas, and the provisions of this chapter. 

(b) Approval of restoration projects shall be based on a review of a plan containing, at a minimum, an analysis of existing conditions, identification of the area to be restored, proposed corrective actions, including installation of native species, performance standards, monitoring schedule, planting plans, erosion and sedimentation control plans, and grading plans, as necessary. 

(c) The shoreline administrator shall require an applicant to retain the services of a qualified professional in preparing the restoration plan. Intrusions into regulated steep slopes and associated setbacks will be allowed for purposes of approved restoration projects. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.20.190 Shoreline protection and stabilization.

(1) Shoreline Stabilization. Shoreline stabilization may be permitted in the shoreline as follows: Hard armoring (e.g., bulkheads and riprap) is subject to a shoreline conditional use permit in the rural residential and beach community environments. Soft shore stabilization may be permitted in the rural residential and beach community environments under a conditional use permit. Shoreline stabilization proposals shall address the following: 

(a) Shoreline stabilization, including bulkheads, shall not be considered an outright permitted use on the city’s shorelines. In order for shoreline stabilization to be permitted, the city must find that: 

(i) The applicant shall provide a geotechnical report, prepared by a qualified professional, that estimates the rate of erosion and evaluates alternative solutions and the urgency associated with the specific situation;

(ii) Soft shore stabilization alternatives such as slope drainage systems, vegetative growth stabilization, gravel berms, and beach nourishment shall be prioritized over structural options such as bulkheads and riprap; the “softest” effective alternative shall be utilized; 

(iii) In the case of proposed hard armoring stabilization solutions (e.g., bulkheads and riprap), erosion from waves or currents presents a clear and imminent (damage within three years) threat to a legally established primary structure, one or more substantial accessory structures, water-dependent development, ecological restoration/toxic clean-up remediation projects, or public improvements; 

(iv) In the case of bulkheads and riprap, the proposed shoreline stabilization is located landward of the ordinary high water mark as determined through a site visit; 

(v) The proposed shoreline stabilization is the minimum size necessary to protect existing improvements; 

(vi) The applicant shall demonstrate that impacts to sediment transport are minimized to the greatest extent possible; 

(vii) Shoreline stabilization shall not have an adverse impact on the property of others and shall be designed so as not to create the need for shoreline stabilization elsewhere; 

(viii) Shoreline stabilization shall not significantly interfere with normal surface and/or subsurface drainage into the water body and shall be constructed using an approved filter cloth or other suitable means to allow passage of surface and groundwater without internal erosion of fine material; 

(ix) Shoreline stabilization shall not be used to create new lands; 

(x) Use of chemically treated wood is prohibited for any shoreline stabilization proposal within freshwater stream shorelines; 

(xi) Use of creosote treated wood is prohibited within marine shorelines; 

(xii) Revegetation with native plants is required as part of the shoreline stabilization project; and

(xiii) Shoreline stabilization shall not otherwise result in a net loss of ecological functions.

(xiv) As a condition of any permit for development on a slope or at the base of slope on which soil movement may potentially occur, the property owner will be required to grant and record a covenant running with the land releasing the city from liability for damages caused by soil movement, except for damages caused by the city’s sole negligence. The covenant shall also require the owner to inform his/her successors and assigns that the property is located in a potential slide area, that successors and assigns are required to comply with any conditions or prohibitions on development set forth in the permit or in the city’s regulations, and that successors and assigns are required to maintain any feature described in the permit that is necessary to address potential soil movement.

(b) When a bulkhead or other structural alternative is permitted subject to subsection (1)(a) of this section, the following standards shall apply: 

(i) The maximum height of the proposed bulkhead or other stabilization structure is no more than three feet above the elevation of the ordinary high water mark on tidal waters measured from grade on the waterward side of the bulkhead or structure. 

(ii) When a bulkhead or other stabilization structure has deteriorated such that the ordinary high water mark has been established by the presence and action of water landward of the existing bulkhead, then the replacement bulkhead or structure must be located at or landward of the ordinary high water mark. 

(iii) Repair of an existing bulkhead or other stabilization structure is permitted under a substantial development permit; provided, that the repaired bulkhead or structure is not relocated further waterward or increased in height and is subject to subsection (1)(a) of this section. 

(iv) If an existing bulkhead or other stabilization structure is destroyed it may be replaced as it existed prior to destruction, provided application for required permits is made within two years of destruction and the applicant has demonstrated that soft shoreline armoring is not feasible and the applicant has demonstrated the need to protect principal uses or structures from tidal action or waves. Additions to or increases in size of existing shoreline stabilization measures shall be considered new structures. 

(v) Soft shoreline stabilization measures that provide restoration of shoreline ecological functions may be permitted waterward of the ordinary high water mark and are subject to subsection (1)(a) of this section. 

(vi) The project satisfies the provisions of Chapter 18.36 NPMC, Critical Areas Development Regulations, and WAC 172-26-231(3)(a)(iii)(C). 

(vii) Mitigate new erosion control measures, including replacement structures, on feeder bluffs or other actions that affect beach sediment-producing areas to avoid and, if that is not possible, to minimize adverse impacts to sediment conveyance systems per WAC 172-26-231(3)(a)(iii)(C).

(viii) Existing unpermitted bulkheads constructed since 1991 that need repair and replacement must comply with current shoreline master program regulations and would be considered new bulkheads for the purposes of this program.

(c) Creation of new lots shall be prohibited where development and use on new lots would require structural shoreline stabilization over the life of the development. The following standards shall apply to new development: 

(i) New development that would require shoreline stabilization which causes significant impacts to adjacent or down-current properties and shoreline areas should not be allowed. 

(ii) New development, including newly created parcels, is required to be designed and located to prevent the need for future shoreline stabilization as documented by a geotechnical analysis. 

(iii) New development on steep slopes and bluffs is required to be set back sufficiently to ensure that shoreline stabilization is unlikely to be necessary during the life of the project as demonstrated by a geotechnical analysis and must comply with Chapter 18.36 NPMC. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.195 Shoreline vegetation conservation.

(1) Policies.

(a) Design uses and developments to preserve native shoreline vegetation to maintain shoreline ecological functions and processes and prevent direct, indirect and/or cumulative impacts of shoreline development.

(b) Establish native shoreline vegetation through new uses and developments such that the composition, structure, and density of the plant community resemble a natural, unaltered shoreline as much as possible.

(c) Limit removal of native vegetation to the minimum necessary to accommodate shoreline development.

(d) Restrict native vegetation removal within shoreline jurisdiction in order to maintain shoreline functions, including protection of habitat and shoreline bluffs.

(e) Maintaining well-vegetated shorelines is preferred over clearing vegetation to create views or provide lawns. Limited and selective clearing for views and lawns may be allowed when slope stability and ecological functions are not compromised, but landowners should not assume that creating an unobstructed view of the water will be allowed. Trimming and pruning are generally preferred over removal of native vegetation. 

(f) Property owners should be encouraged to avoid or minimize the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.

(g) Shoreline landowners are encouraged to preserve and enhance native woody vegetation and native groundcovers to stabilize soils and provide habitat. 

(h) Nonnative vegetation that requires use of fertilizers, herbicides, and/or pesticides is discouraged.

(2) Regulations.

(a) Unless otherwise specified, all shoreline use and development, including preferred uses and uses exempt from permit requirements, shall comply with the buffer provisions of this program and Chapters 9.02 and 18.36 NPMC to protect and maintain shoreline vegetation and habitat.

(b) Removal of native vegetation shall be avoided, where feasible. Where removal of native vegetation cannot be avoided, it shall be minimized to protect ecological functions. If nonnative vegetation is to be removed, then it shall be replaced with native vegetation within the shoreline jurisdiction.

(c) Native plant materials that are equivalent to those which would typically occur with respect to size, structure, and diversity at maturation shall be used in restoration, rehabilitation, or enhancement projects. 

(d) Proponents of all new shoreline uses or developments shall demonstrate that site designs and layouts are consistent with the policies of this section to ensure shoreline functions, values, and processes are maintained and preserved. A shoreline permit or written statement of exemption shall not mandate, nor guarantee, unobstructed horizontal or lateral visibility of the water, shoreline or any specific feature near or far.

(e) Trimming of trees and vegetation is allowed within shoreline setback areas without a landscape plan; provided, that:

(i) This provision is not interpreted to allow clearing of vegetation;

(ii) Trimming does not include topping, stripping or imbalances; a minimum of 60 percent of the original crown shall be retained to maintain tree health;

(iii) Trimming does not directly impact shoreline functions including fish and wildlife habitat;

(iv) Trimming is not within a wetland or wetland buffer or fish and wildlife habitat conservation area (FWHCA) buffer; and 

(v) Trimming in landslide and erosion hazard areas does not impact soil stability.

(f) The shoreline administrator may deny a request or condition approval of vegetation management or removal proposals for view maintenance if it is determined the action will result in an adverse effect to any of the following:

(i) Slope stability;

(ii) Habitat value;

(iii) Health of surrounding vegetation;

(iv) Risk of wind damage to surrounding vegetation;

(v) Nearby surface or groundwater; or

(vi) Water quality of a nearby water body.

(g) Clearing by hand-held equipment of invasive or nonnative shoreline vegetation or plants listed on the State Noxious Weed List is permitted in shoreline locations if native vegetation is promptly reestablished in the disturbed area.

(h) Aquatic weed control shall only occur to protect native plant communities and associated habitats or where an existing water-dependent use is restricted by the presence of weeds. Aquatic weed control shall occur in compliance with all other applicable laws and standards and shall be done by a qualified professional. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.20.200 Shoreline modification activities.

(1) Piers and Docks.

(a) A pier or dock is a structure abutting the shoreline built over or floating on the water, used as a landing place for marine transport or for recreational purposes for private, noncommercial pleasure craft. Piers are built on fixed platforms above the water, while docks float upon the water.

(b) New piers and docks or the expansion of existing piers and docks is prohibited.

(2) Floats – Residential.

(a) Floats are structures that are floating and attached by mooring to the surface below water.

(b) One float is allowed per residence.

(c) Floats cannot be larger than 120 square feet in size and must be constructed from materials that are based on best available science and least harmful to the environment. Styrofoam floats may not be used.

(v) Launching ramps, rails, or lift stations shall not be permitted for shoreline developments that have an existing pier, dock, mooring buoy, or other functional moorage. Piers, docks, or other forms of moorage shall not be permitted for shoreline developments that have existing launching ramps, rails, or lift stations.

(vi) Launching ramps, rails, and lift stations shall be sited and designed to ensure protection of navigation routes and access; they shall be aesthetically compatible with or enhance existing shoreline features, and shall be clearly marked and separated from nearby swimming areas.

(4) Groins.

(a) Groins are barrier-type structures extending from the backshore seaward across the beach. The basic purpose of a groin is to interrupt the sand movement along the shore.

(b) Trapping of sand by a groin is done at the expense of the adjacent downdrift shore, unless the groin system is filled with sand to its entrapment capacity.

(c) Construction of groins will be permitted to preserve, protect, or restore an area of the shoreline where the effects of natural forces indicate a need for corrective action and if unsafe conditions for property would occur otherwise.

(i) Construction of groins shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

(d) Approval of the permit must consider the effects of the proposed installation on adjacent properties.

(e) Structures waterward of the ordinary high water mark are allowed only for water-dependent uses, public access, shoreline stabilization, or other specific public purpose. WAC 173-26-231(3)(d).

(E) Demonstration that fill timing will minimize damage to water quality and aquatic life. 

(iv) Fill, except for beach nourishment, shall be prohibited in areas of high shoreline erosion potential. 

(v) Fill located waterward of the ordinary high water mark that results in a net loss of shoreline function is prohibited.

(6) Signs.

(a) Signs are publicly displayed messages designed to provide information, direction or advertising, and may be pleasing or distracting depending upon their number, design, and location. Uncontrolled use of signs can be detrimental to surrounding property values and may seriously detract from the enjoyment, pleasure, and the natural beauty of the shoreline. Shoreline character and attractiveness should be protected to the greatest extent possible from the ill effects of signs. Any new sign codes for the city should recognize the unique aesthetic character and ecological qualities of shoreline areas.

(b) When permitted by the zoning ordinance, NPMC Title 18, signs shall be permitted within the shoreline area only when the following standards are met:

(i) Any sign except those that deal with public access or public safety shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

(ii) No signs shall be of the flashing or animated type, except those required by law or necessary for the safety of land, water, or air navigation and circulation.

(iii) Signs shall be designed and constructed in a manner that minimizes visual obstruction of the shoreline. Vistas and viewpoints shall be free from unnecessary signs.

(iv) Signs, when permitted, shall be placed so as not to impair views of the shoreline or impair views upland from the water except where dangerous conditions require warning signs.

(v) Warning signs shall be installed by the city or by other appropriate entities where hazardous conditions exist on public properties.

16.20.210 Residential element.

(1) “Residential development” means one or more buildings or structures or portions thereof designed for and used for human habitation. Residential development includes one- and two-family detached dwellings, multifamily residences, townhouses, and other similar group housing, together with accessory uses and structures common to residential uses, including but not limited to garages, sheds, tennis courts, swimming pools, parking areas, fences, and guest cottages. The only type of residential development permitted within Normandy Park’s shoreline environment is single-family residential use, except for planned residential developments. Both short subdivisions and formal plats are forms of residential development.

(2) Uses and facilities associated with residential development that are identified as separate use activities in this shoreline master program, including piers and docks, bulkheads, shoreline protection, utilities, landfill, and land clearing and grading practices, are subject to the regulations established for those uses in addition to any special conditions relating to residential areas established in this section.

(3) Pressure to develop shorelines for residential uses has resulted in property subdivision and escalating waterfront land values. Residential development of shorelines is accomplished in a variety of ways from large plats and subdivisions for multifamily dwellings to single lot development for recreational housing, any of which, if poorly planned, can result in the degradation of the shoreline environment and water resources.

(4) Although the Shoreline Management Act specifically exempts “construction on wetlands by an owner, lessee or contract purchaser of a single-family residence for his(/her) own use or the use of his(/her) family...” from shoreline substantial development permit requirements, residential developments must conform to the policies of the Shoreline Management Act and the policies and use regulations of this shoreline master program.

(5) Residential development, when permitted by the zoning code, shall be permitted within the shoreline area only when the following regulations and standards are met:

(a) Only when developed in a manner consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment.

(b) Residential development in shoreline areas shall comply with all applicable policies and requirements of the city including those in the comprehensive plan, zoning code, and subdivision ordinance. Refer to NPMC 16.20.215 Table 2, Development Standards in Shoreline Designations. 

(c) Sewage disposal facilities, as well as water supply facilities, shall be provided for all residential development in accordance with appropriate state and local health regulations.

(d) Residential development over water including floating homes is prohibited, except accessory docks for pleasure craft.

(e) Subdivisions should be designed at a level of density, site coverage, and occupancy compatible with the physical capabilities of the shoreline and site.

(f) Site coverage shall include all impermeable surfaces.

(g) Minimum building setbacks from the OHWM and sensitive areas (e.g., eroding bluffs or shores, wetlands, and streams where setbacks shall be measured from the top of the bluff or nearest wetland edge) shall be no less than setbacks specified in Chapter 18.36 NPMC, Critical Areas Development Regulations (see NPMC 16.20.215 Table 2, Development Standards in Shoreline Designations). Actual building setbacks shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. The following factors shall be taken into account: underlying zoning requirements, height of bluff or bank, soils and groundwater characteristics and other factors affecting slope stability and environmental effects on sensitive areas such as streams and wetlands.

(h) Boathouses or other buildings or structures for the storage or shelter of boats may be permitted when set back at least five feet landward of the OHWM and when installed so that no sight-obscuring portion thereof extends 12 feet above the average grade level.

(i) Residential development should protect the natural vegetation of the shoreline area.

(j) Residential subdivisions and planned residential developments should be designed to protect water quality, shoreline aesthetic characteristics, vistas, and normal public use of the water.

(k) Residential development plans submitted for approval should contain provisions for protection of groundwater supplies, erosion control, landscaping, and maintenance of the shoreline integrity.

(l) The established velocity, quantity, and quality of stormwater discharge should consider the sensitivity of the proposed receiving environment. The disposal mode selected should mitigate impacts to infiltration, runoff, and groundwater recharge.

(m) Residential development shall not be located nor designed to require structural shore defense or flood protection works.

(n) Residential development is prohibited within the 100-year floodplain, except when it can be demonstrated that the reduced storage capacity of the floodplain will not significantly increase the flood hazard to other properties nor otherwise endanger public safety.

(o) Residential development is prohibited within floodways.

(p) Residential development within other hazardous areas such as steep slopes and areas with unstable soils or geologic conditions shall be sited and designed consistent with appropriate engineering principles. Professional geotechnical site studies or design may be required by the city engineer.

(q) Accreted beach shall not be developed. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).

(Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.20.220 Land clearing and grading activities.

(1) Land clearing and grading practices are those methods used for the cutting and/or removal of trees, brush, and other vegetation and for grading activities. The following use regulations are aimed at controlling the activities of land clearing and grading for the protection of forest and fish resources for present and future use and for all the residents of the city, county, and state.

(2) For land clearing and grading practices, the following regulations shall apply:

(a) All land clearing and grading practices in shoreline areas shall be conducted to cause the least possible adverse impacts on the land and water environment, shall respect the natural character of the shoreline, and should make every effort to preserve wildlife, aquatic life, and their habitats.

(b) Minimum land clearing and grading activity setbacks from the OHWM and sensitive areas (e.g., eroding bluffs, or shores, wetlands, and streams where setbacks shall be measured from the top of the bluff or nearest wetland edge) shall be at least the size specified in Chapter 18.36 NPMC.

(c) Tree, brush, and vine removal in steep slopes and fragile areas shall be prohibited, except as required for public safety and to protect public or private property.

(d) All land clearing and grading shall be accomplished in a manner which minimizes erosion.

(e) All cut, fill, and side cast slopes shall be planted or seeded with appropriate ground cover or otherwise treated to prevent erosion of the slope.

(f) All ruts and erodible soil conditions caused by timber harvesting, brush cutting, or any land clearing and grading operations shall be water-barred or planted with appropriate ground cover.

(g) Whenever seeding, planting, or other soil stabilizing measures are specified, such measures shall be performed as soon as practical.

(h) Land being cleared or graded need not be revegetated if the new use is to be substantially completed within one year of the clearing or grading. However, proper erosion control shall be required.

(i) Replanted vegetation shall be of a similar type and concentration as existing in the general vicinity of the site or per landscape plan approved by the city engineer. 

(j) All vegetation removal or modification must also comply with NPMC 16.20.195, Shoreline vegetation conservation.

(k) Vegetation clearing except for the purposes of restoration and enhancement is prohibited in the urban conservancy and bluff conservancy environments or as permitted under a variance from this shoreline master program. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.230 Conservation.

Repealed by Ord. 940. (Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.240 Public access.

(1) Public access shall be required for all shoreline development and uses, except for a single-family residence or residential projects containing less than four dwelling units when the development would generate demand for one or more forms of public shoreline access. Public access provisions shall be required for all new public shoreline development and uses, unless such access is shown to be incompatible due to reasons of safety, security or impact to the shoreline.

Because of private property ownership patterns, including privately owned tidelands and steep bluffs, the public has access to the beach only at Marine View Park in Normandy Park.

(a) Public access to and along the water’s edge shall be available within publicly owned shorelines that are tolerant of human activity where municipal liability is an acceptable risk.

(b) Shoreline access areas shall be planned to include ancillary facilities such as parking and sanitation and shall be designed and developed to provide adequate protection for adjacent private properties.

(c) Appropriate signs shall be used to delineate publicly owned shoreline areas.

(d) The rights of the individual property owners of shoreline, tidelands, clam beds and uplands shall be respected and protected.

(e) Public access shall be policed and improved consistent with the intensity of use. 

(2) Public access shall consist of a dedication of land or a physical improvement in the form of a walkway trail bikeway corridor viewpoint park or other area serving as a means of view and or physical approach to shorelines of the state and may include interpretive centers and displays.

(a) Developments, uses, and activities shall be designed and operated to avoid blocking, reducing, or adversely interfering with the public’s visual or physical access to the water and the shorelines. In providing visual access to the shoreline, natural vegetation shall not be excessively removed either by clearing or by topping. 

(b) Public access sites shall be connected directly to the nearest public street through a parcel boundary, tract, or easement.

(c) Public access sites shall be made barrier free for the physically disabled where feasible.

(d) Required public access sites shall be fully developed and available for public use at the time of occupancy or use of the development or activity.

(3) A shoreline development or use that does not provide public access may be authorized provided it is demonstrated by the applicant and determined by the city that one or more of the following provisions apply:

(a) Unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public exist that cannot be prevented by any practical means;

(b) Inherent security requirements of the use cannot be satisfied through the application of alternative design features or other solutions; 

(c) The cost of providing the access, easement, alternative amenity, or mitigating the impacts of public access is unreasonably disproportionate to the total long term cost of the proposed development;

(d) Unacceptable environmental harm will result from the public access which cannot be mitigated; or 

(e) Significant undue and unavoidable conflict between the proposed access and adjacent uses would occur and cannot be mitigated. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.250 Recreation.

(1) Recreation is the passive or active refreshment of body and mind through forms of play, amusement, or relaxation. This section applies to both publicly and privately owned shoreline facilities intended for use by the public or a private club, group, or association.

(2) Priority will be given to recreational development for access to and use of the water. Recreational experiences that depend on or use the shoreline include: harvesting of fish, shellfish, fowl, minerals and driftwood; various forms of boating, swimming and walking; and watching or recording activities such as photography, painting, or the viewing of water-dependent activities. Principal focal points are parks, viewpoints, features of special interest, water access points, and destination points for boaters. Facilities at these focal points may include swimming floats, paths, parking areas, boat ramps, mooring and marinas, and accessory recreational facilities.

(3) Uses and activities associated with recreational developments which are identified as separate use activities in this program, such as boating facilities; residential development and commercial development, are subject to the regulations established for those uses in addition to the standards for recreation established in this section.

(4) Recreational development shall be permitted within the shoreline area only when the following regulations and standards are met:

(a) To avoid wasteful use of the limited supply of recreational shoreland, parking areas shall be located a minimum of 115 feet landward from the OHWM and must comply with Chapter 18.36 NPMC. Access shall be provided by walkways or other facilities for nonmotorized conveyance.

(b) Recreational developments shall not create significant adverse effects on residential uses of private property, environmental quality, or natural resources of the shoreline area.

(c) All recreational developments shall be sited to protect neighboring uses.

(d) Structural forms should harmonize with the topography, reinforce use areas, minimize damage to natural resources, and support recreation with minimal human or resource conflict.

(e) New construction should be sympathetic to the scale, form, and proportion of neighboring development, to promote harmony in visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings.

(f) Whenever possible, natural nonreflective materials (e.g., wood, stone, gravel, etc.) shall be used in developing shoreline recreational areas.

(g) Valuable shoreline resources and fragile or unique areas such as marshes, estuaries, and accretion beaches shall be used only for nonintensive and nonstructural recreation activities.

(h) All permanent recreational structures and facilities which are not water dependent shall be set back a minimum of 115 feet landward from the OHWM and shall be located outside the 100-year floodplain, although the city may grant exceptions for nonintensive accessory uses (e.g., picnic tables, play areas, etc.), and must comply with Chapters 9.02 and 18.36 NPMC.

(i) Accessory use facilities such as restrooms, recreation halls and gymnasiums, commercial services, access roads, and parking areas shall be located a minimum of 115 feet inland from the OHWM, unless such facilities are water dependent. These areas shall be linked to the shoreline by walkways.

(j) In approving shoreline recreational developments, the city shall ensure that the development will maintain, enhance or restore desirable shoreline features, including unique and fragile areas, scenic views, and aesthetic values. To this end, the city may adjust and/or prescribe project dimensions, location of project components on the site, intensity of use, screening, parking requirements, and setbacks, as deemed appropriate to achieve the intent of this shoreline master program.

(k) Proposals for recreational developments shall include a landscape plan, in which native, self-sustaining vegetation is preferred.

(l) The removal of on-site native vegetation shall be limited to the minimum necessary for the development of picnic areas, selected views, or other permitted structures or facilities. 

(m) Low impact passive recreation is permitted in the bluff conservancy environment; however, no structures are permitted for recreational purposes. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.260 Circulation.

This is an element for assessing the location and extent of existing and proposed transportation routes, and other public facilities, and correlating those facilities with shoreline use elements. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.270 Transportation facilities.

(1) Transportation facilities are those structures and developments that aid in land and water surface movement of people, goods, and services. They include roads and highways, bridges and causeways, bikeways, trails, ferry terminals, and other related facilities.

(2) Transportation facility construction shall be permitted within the rural residential and beach community environments only when the following regulations and standards are met:

(a) New surface transportation facilities not related to and necessary for the support of shoreline dependent activities shall be set back from the ordinary high water mark a minimum of 115 feet to make protective measures, such as riprap or other bank stabilization, landfill, bulkheads, groins, jetties or substantial site regrading unnecessary.

(b) Transportation and utility facilities shall be required to make joint use of rights-of-way and to consolidate crossing of water bodies in order to mitigate adverse impacts to the shoreline.

(c) No vehicles shall be allowed on Normandy Park beach areas except for residential service access and by existing prescriptive easement.

(d) Landfills for transportation facility development are not permitted in water bodies or associated wetlands and beaches, except when all structural or upland alternatives have proven infeasible and the transportation facilities are necessary to support uses consistent with this program.

(e) Transportation facilities that are allowed to cross over water bodies and associated wetlands shall use elevated, open pile, or pier structures whenever feasible. All bridges must be built high enough to allow the passage of debris and anticipated high water flows.

(f) All roads shall be set back at least 115 feet from the OHWM and water bodies and shall comply with Chapters 9.02 and 18.36 NPMC.

(g) The city shall give preference to mechanical means for roadside brush control rather than the use of herbicides on city roads in shoreline areas. If herbicides are used, they shall be applied so that chemicals do not enter water bodies or stream ways and all permits for their use must be obtained prior to their use. 

(h) Proposed transportation and parking facilities must be designed and located where they will have the least possible adverse effect on unique or fragile shoreline features, will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions, or adversely impact existing or planned water-dependent uses.

(i) Parking facilities in shorelines are not a preferred use and shall only be allowed as necessary to support an authorized use. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.280 Utilities (primary).

Utilities are services and facilities that produce, transmit, store, process or dispose of electric power, gas, water, sewage, and communications. Utilities in this SMP are divided into primary and accessory based on type and scale. The provisions of this section apply to primary use and activities such as solid waste handling and disposal, water transmission lines, sewage treatment facilities and mains, power generating or high voltage transmission facilities, gas distribution lines and storage facilities, stormwater mains and regional stormwater treatment facilities.

(1) Policies.

Policy 1: New primary utilities should be located outside of the SMA unless no other feasible option exists. Where allowed they should utilize existing transportation and utility sites, rights-of-way and corridors whenever possible, rather than creating new corridors. Joint use of rights-of-way and corridors should be encouraged. 

Policy 2: Solid waste disposal activities and facilities should be prohibited in shoreline areas. “Solid waste facilities” are not to be construed as storage of recyclable materials. 

Policy 3: Primary utilities should avoid locating in environmentally sensitive areas unless no feasible alternatives exist. 

Policy 4: Wherever primary utility facilities and corridors must be placed in a shoreline area, they should be located so as to protect scenic views. Whenever possible, such facilities should be placed underground or designed to minimize impacts on the aesthetic qualities of the shoreline area. 

(2) Regulations.

Regulation 1: Primary utilities shall be located outside of SMA jurisdiction unless no other feasible option exists. 

Regulation 2: Primary utilities shall be located landward of the ordinary high water mark unless such location is not feasible or would result in potentially greater environmental impacts. 

Regulation 3: Primary utility facilities shall avoid disturbance of unique and fragile areas, as well as wildlife spawning, nesting and rearing areas. Utility facility development shall result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Mitigation shall be provided as necessary to meet this requirement. Failure to meet this standard will result in permit denial. 

Regulation 4: Utility development shall, through coordination with local government agencies, provide for compatible, multiple use of sites and rights-of-way. Such uses include shoreline access points, trail systems and other forms of recreation and transportation, providing such uses will not unduly interfere with utility operations, endanger public health and safety or create a significant and disproportionate liability for the owner. 

Regulation 5: Utility lines shall utilize existing rights-of-way, corridors and/or bridge crossings whenever possible, and shall avoid duplication and construction of new corridors in all shoreline areas. Proposals for new corridors or water crossings must fully substantiate the infeasibility of existing routes. 

Regulation 6: Solid waste disposal sites and facilities are prohibited in the shoreline environment. 

Regulation 7: Where major facilities must be placed in a shoreline area, the location and design shall be chosen so as not to destroy or obstruct scenic views. 

Regulation 8: Primary utility development shall provide screening of facilities from water bodies and adjacent properties. Screening, including landscaping and fencing, shall be designed to constitute a dense “full screen.” 

Regulation 9: Clearing of vegetation for the installation or maintenance of utilities shall be kept to a minimum, and upon project completion, any disturbed areas shall be restored to their pre-project condition. 

Regulation 10: The city shall hold public meetings prior to the issuance of a substantial development permit for a major primary utility project in accordance with the administrative procedures outlined in this master program to allow for the greatest amount of public input to help guide utility-related decisions. 

Regulation 11: Utilities are prohibited in aquatic and bluff conservancy environments. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.285 Utilities (accessory).

(1) Applicability. Utilities have been split into the categories “accessory” and “primary with accessory,” meaning utilities that affect small-scale distribution services connected directly to the uses along the shoreline. For example, power distribution, telephone, cable, water and sewer service lines, and stormwater collection and conveyance, are all considered as utilities accessory to shoreline uses. They are covered in this section because they concern all types of development and have the potential of impacting the ecological condition and visual quality of the shoreline and its waters. 

(2) Policies. 

Policy 1: Utilities are necessary to serve shoreline uses and should be properly installed to protect the shoreline and water from contamination and degradation. 

Policy 2: Utility facilities and rights-of-way should be located outside of the shoreline area to the maximum extent possible. When utility lines require a shoreline location, they should be placed underground, where feasible. 

Policy 3: Utility facilities should be designed and located in a manner which preserves the natural landscape and shoreline ecology and minimizes conflicts with present and planned land uses.

(3) Regulations. 

Regulation 1: Utility developments shall, through coordination with local government agencies, provide for compatible, multiple use of sites and rights-of-way. Such uses include shoreline access points, trail systems, and other forms of recreation and transportation, providing such uses will not unduly interfere with utility operations, or endanger public health and safety. 

Regulation 2: In shoreline areas, accessory utilities shall be placed underground unless demonstrated to be infeasible. Further, such lines shall utilize existing rights-of-way, and existing corridors whenever possible.

Regulation 3: Utility facilities shall be located and designed to avoid destruction of, or damage to, important wildlife areas, and other unique and fragile areas. Utility facility development shall result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Mitigation shall be provided as necessary to meet this requirement. Failure to meet this standard will result in permit denial. 

Regulation 4: Clearing for the installation or maintenance of utilities shall be kept to a minimum, and upon project completion, any disturbed area shall be restored, to the greatest extent feasible, to pre-project conditions, including replanting with native species, or other species as approved by the city, and maintenance care. If the previous condition is identified as being undesirable for shoreline function, then landscaping and other improvements shall be undertaken. 

Regulation 5: The location and construction of outfalls shall comply with all appropriate federal, state, county and city regulations. 

Regulation 6: The city of Normandy Park shall maintain, enhance and restore public natural drainage systems to protect water quality, reduce flooding, reduce public costs and prevent associated environmental degradation for a no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

Regulation 7: New utility lines including electricity, communications, and fuel lines shall be located underground. Existing above ground lines shall be moved underground when properties are redeveloped or in conjunction with major system upgrades or replacements. 

Regulation 8: Utility development shall include public access to the shoreline, trail systems, and other forms of recreation, providing such uses will not unduly interfere with utility operations, endanger the public health, safety, and welfare, or create a significant and disproportionate liability for the owner. 

Regulation 9: Proposals for new utility corridors shall fully substantiate the infeasibility of existing routes. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.20.290 Archaeological resources and historic sites.

The following regulations shall apply to any structure or area designated or considered an archaeological or historical site that is located within the shoreline environment:

(1) Any project that would disturb an area designated or considered an archaeological or historical site shall require a shoreline conditional use permit.

(2) If archaeological resources are discovered during excavation or construction within the shoreline environment, a work stoppage is required and a shoreline conditional use permit shall be obtained. The applicant shall notify the local government, state office of archaeology and historic preservation, and affected Indian tribes if archaeological resources are uncovered during excavation.

(3) The preservation of archaeological resources and historic buildings shall be encouraged within the shoreline environment. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.20.300 Economic development.

This element is for the location and design of industries, transportation, port, tourist, commercial facilities, and other developments dependent on shoreline locations and/or water access.

(1) Economic development is prohibited along the shoreline of Normandy Park. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).

16.24.010 Generally.

No substantial development shall be undertaken on shorelines of the state without first obtaining a substantial development, variance, or conditional use permit from the city. “Substantial development” means any development of which the total cost or fair market value exceeds $6,400 or the current dollar threshold determined by the state, whichever is greater, or any development that materially interferes with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the state, except those exempted developments set forth in WAC 173-27-040, as now exists or as amended hereafter.

Exemption from substantial development permit requirements does not constitute exemption from the policies and use regulations of the Shoreline Management Act, the provisions of this master program, and other applicable city, state or federal permit requirements. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.015 Federal project compliance.1

Pursuant to WAC 173-27-060 the following will apply to federal and nonfederal activities:

(1) Direct federal agency activities in or affecting Washington’s coastal zone shall be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the most recent federally approved Washington State Coastal Zone Management Program pursuant to the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq. (CZMA) and federal regulations adopted pursuant thereto.

Washington’s coastal zone, as established in the state’s approved Coastal Zone Management Program, includes the following coastal counties: Whatcom, Skagit, San Juan, Island, Snohomish, King, Pierce, Thurston, Mason, Kitsap, Jefferson, Clallam, Grays Harbor, Pacific and Wahkiakum.

The Shoreline Management Act is incorporated into the Washington State Coastal Zone Management Program and, thereby, those direct federal agency activities affecting the uses or resources subject to the Act must be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable provisions of the Act, regulations adopted pursuant to the Act and the local master program.

(a) When the department receives a consistency determination for an activity proposed by the federal government, it shall request that local government review the proposal and provide the department with its views regarding the consistency of the activity or development project with the enforceable policies of the local master program.

(b) The CZMA federal consistency decision-making process for federal agency activities is prescribed in the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(1) and (2)), in federal regulations at 15 C.F.R. Part 930, subpart C, and in Washington’s most recent federally approved CZM Program document.

(2) Federal agency activities may be required by other federal laws to meet the permitting requirements of Chapter 90.58 RCW.

(3) The policies and provisions of Chapter 90.58 RCW, including the permit system, shall apply statewide to all nonfederal developments and uses undertaken on federal lands and on lands subject to nonfederal ownership, lease or easement, even though such lands may fall within the external boundaries of a federal ownership. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.24.020  SMP administration. 

The Shoreline Management Act requires that local government shall have primary responsibility for initiating and administering this shoreline master program. This chapter establishes the policies for the application and enforcement of the provisions of this shoreline master program. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.030 Shoreline administrator.

(1) The SMP administrator for Normandy Park shall be the city manager or his designee.

(2) The administrator shall receive all applications for substantial development permits, conditional use and variance permits, and exemptions pertinent to the shoreline area of the city. The administrator has the authority for and the responsibility to:

(a) Approve or deny statements of exemption, pursuant to the exemptions from substantial development permits section of this master program.

(b) Review applications for conformity to the rules and regulations of this master program.

(c) Provide the applicant with a checklist of other authority approvals potentially required in addition to the city’s.

(d) Ensure that the required publication/posting/mailing of public notices, described in the user’s guide section of this master program, is accomplished.

(e) Approve, approve with conditions, or deny substantial development permits, including conditional use and variance permits, and exemptions; provided, that city approval of conditional use and variance permits must be submitted to the Department of Ecology for approval/disapproval (RCW 90.58.140(10)).

(f) Issue regulatory orders pursuant to the enforcement and penalties section of this master program. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.040 Exemptions from substantial development permit requirements.

(1) Application and Interpretation of Exemptions.

(a) Certain development activities are exempt from the requirement to secure a shoreline substantial development permit. Exemptions are itemized below. Note, however, that applications for development permits must include a written statement of exemption as provided for in WAC 173-27-050, as now exists or as amended hereafter. Interpretations of exemption status shall be narrowly construed. Exemption from shoreline permits does not exempt activities from other state and federal permits that may be required. Only those developments that meet the precise terms of one or more of the listed exemptions may be granted exemption from the substantial development permit process.

(b) An exemption from the substantial development permit process is not an exemption from compliance with the Act or the local master program, nor from any other regulatory requirements. To be authorized, all uses and developments must be consistent with the policies and provisions of the applicable master program and the Shoreline Management Act. A development or use that is listed as a conditional use pursuant to the local master program, or is an unlisted use, must obtain a conditional use permit even though the development or use does not require a substantial development permit. When a development or use is proposed that does not comply with the bulk, dimensional and performance standards of the master program, such development or use can only be authorized by approval of a variance.

(c) The burden of proof that a development or use is exempt from the permit process is on the applicant.

(d) If any part of a proposed development is not eligible for exemption, then a substantial development permit is required for the entire proposed development project.

(e) Local government may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments and/or uses as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Act and the local master program.

(2) The following developments shall not require substantial development permits:

(a) Any development where the total cost or fair market value, whichever is higher, does not exceed $6,400 or the current dollar threshold determined by the state as described in WAC 173-27-040(2)(a), whichever is greater, and such development does not materially interfere with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the state;

(b) Normal maintenance or repair of existing structures or developments, including damage by accident, fire, or elements. “Normal maintenance” includes those usual acts to prevent decline, lapse, or cessation from a lawfully established condition. “Normal repair” means to restore a development to a state comparable to its original condition including but not limited to its size, shape, configuration, location and external appearance, within a reasonable period after decay or partial destruction, except where repair causes substantial adverse effects to shoreline resource or environment. Replacement of a structure or development may be authorized as repair where such replacement is the common method of repair for the type of structure or development and the replacement structure or development is comparable to the original structure or development including but not limited to its size, shape, configuration, location and external appearance and the replacement does not cause substantial adverse effects to shoreline resources or environment;

(c) Construction of a normal protective bulkhead common to single-family residences. A normal protective bulkhead is constructed at or near the ordinary high water mark to protect a single-family residence and is for protecting land from erosion, not for the purpose of creating land. Where an existing bulkhead is being replaced, it shall be constructed not further waterward of the existing bulkhead than is necessary for construction of new footings (includes those structural and nonstructural developments installed at or landward of, and parallel to, the ordinary high water mark for the sole purpose of protecting an existing single-family residence and appurtenant structures from loss or damage by erosion). A normal protective bulkhead is not exempt if constructed for the purpose of creating dry land. When a vertical or near-vertical wall is being constructed or reconstructed, not more than one cubic yard of fill per one foot of wall may be used as backfill. When an existing bulkhead is being repaired by construction of a vertical wall fronting the existing wall, it shall be constructed no further waterward of the existing bulkhead than is necessary for construction of new footings. When a bulkhead has deteriorated such that an ordinary high water mark has been established by the presence and action of water landward of the bulkhead, then the replacement bulkhead must be located at or near the actual ordinary high water mark. Beach nourishment and bioengineered erosion control projects may be considered a normal protective bulkhead when any structural elements are consistent with the above requirements and when the project has been approved by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

(d) Emergency construction necessary to protect property from damage by the elements. An “emergency” is an unanticipated and imminent threat to public health, safety, or the environment which requires immediate action within a time frame too short to allow full compliance with this chapter. Emergency construction does not include development of new, permanent, protective structures where none previously existed. Where new protective structures are deemed by the administrator to be the appropriate means to address the emergency situation, upon abatement of the emergency situation, either the new structure shall be removed, or any permit which would have been required, absent an emergency pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW, these regulations, or the local master program shall be obtained. All emergency construction shall be consistent with the policies of Chapter 90.58 RCW and the local master program. As a general matter, flooding or other seasonal events that can be anticipated and may occur, but are not imminent, are not an emergency;

(e) Construction or modification of navigational aids such as channel markers and anchor buoys;

(f) Construction on shorelands by an owner, lessee, or contract purchaser of a single-family residence for their own use or for the use of their family, which residence does not exceed a height of 35 feet above average grade level and which meets all requirements of the state agencies having jurisdiction and the city, other than requirements imposed by this chapter. “Single-family residence” means a detached dwelling designed for and occupied by one family including those structures and developments within a contiguous ownership which are normal appurtenances. An “appurtenance” is necessarily connected to the use and enjoyment of the single-family residence and is located landward of the ordinary high water mark and the perimeter of a wetland. On a statewide basis, normal appurtenances include a garage, deck, driveway, utilities; fences; installation of a conventional septic tank and drainfield; and grading which does not exceed 250 cubic yards and which does not involve placement of fill in any wetland or waterward of the ordinary high water mark. Local circumstances may dictate additional interpretation of normal appurtenances which shall be set forth and regulated within the applicable master program. Construction authorized under this exemption shall be located landward of the ordinary high water mark;

(g) Construction of a dock, including a community dock, designed for pleasure craft only, for the private noncommercial use of the owners, lessee, or contract purchaser of single-family and multiple-family residences. A dock is a landing and moorage facility for watercraft and does not include recreational decks, storage facilities or other appurtenances. This exception applies if either:

(i) In salt waters, the fair market value of the dock does not exceed $2,500; or

(ii) In fresh waters the fair market value of the dock does not exceed $10,000, but if subsequent construction having a fair market value exceeding $2,500 occurs within five years of completion of the prior construction, the subsequent construction shall be considered a substantial development for the purpose of this chapter.

For purposes of this section, “salt water” shall include the tidally influenced marine and estuarine water areas of the state including the Pacific Ocean, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and all bays and inlets associated with any of the above;

(h) Operation, maintenance, or construction of canals, waterways, drains, reservoirs, or other facilities that now exist or are hereafter created or developed as part of an irrigation system for the primary purpose of making use of system waters, including return flow and artificially stored groundwater from the irrigation of lands;

(i) The marking of property lines or corners on state-owned lands, when such marking does not significantly interfere with normal public use of the surface of the water;

(j) Operation and maintenance of any system of dikes, ditches, drains, or other facilities existing on the effective date of the 1975 Amendatory Act (September 8, 1975) which were created, developed, or utilized primarily as a part of an agricultural drainage or diking system;

(k) Any project with a certification from the Governor pursuant to Chapter 80.50 RCW;

(l) Site exploration and investigation activities that are prerequisite to preparation of an application for development authorization under this chapter, if:

(i) The activity does not interfere with the normal public use of the surface waters;

(ii) The activity will have no significant adverse impact on the environment, including but not limited to fish, wildlife, fish or wildlife habitat, water quality, and aesthetic values;

(iii) The activity does not involve the installation of any structure, and upon completion of the activity the vegetation and land configuration of the site are restored to conditions existing before the activity;

(iv) A private entity seeking development authorization under this section first posts a performance bond or provides other evidence of financial responsibility to the local jurisdiction to ensure that the site is restored to preexisting conditions; and

(v) The activity is not subject to the permit requirements of RCW 90.58.550;

(m) The process of removing or controlling aquatic noxious weeds, as defined in RCW 17.26.020, through the use of an herbicide or other treatment methods applicable to weed control that are recommended by a final environmental impact statement published by the Washington State Departments of Agriculture or Ecology jointly with other state agencies under Chapter 43.21C RCW. Aquatic herbicides shall only be used by applicators licensed for their use;

(n) Watershed restoration projects as defined herein. Local government shall review the projects for consistency with the shoreline master program in an expeditious manner and shall issue its decision along with any conditions within 45 days of receiving all materials necessary to review the request for exemption from the applicant. No fee may be charged for accepting and processing requests for exemption for watershed restoration projects as used in this section.

(i) “Watershed restoration project” means a public or private project authorized by the sponsor of a watershed restoration plan that implements the plan or a part of the plan and consists of one or more of the following activities:

(A) A project that involves less than 10 miles of stream reach, in which less than 25 cubic yards of sand, gravel, or soil is removed, imported, disturbed or discharged, and in which no existing vegetation is removed except as minimally necessary to facilitate additional plantings;

(B) A project for the restoration of an eroded or unstable stream bank that employs the principles of bioengineering, including limited use of rock as a stabilization only at the toe of the bank, and with primary emphasis on using native vegetation to control the erosive forces of flowing water; or

(C) A project primarily designed to improve fish and wildlife habitat, remove or reduce impediments to migration of fish, or enhance the fishery resource available for use by all of the citizens of the state; provided, that any structure, other than a bridge or culvert or in-stream habitat enhancement structure associated with the project, is less than 200 square feet in floor area and is located above the ordinary high water mark of the stream.

(ii) “Watershed restoration plan” means a plan, developed or sponsored by the Washington State Departments of Fish and Wildlife, Ecology, Natural Resources, or Transportation; a federally recognized Indian tribe acting within and pursuant to its authority; a city; a county; or a conservation district; that provides a general program and implementation measures or actions for the preservation, restoration, re-creation, or enhancement of the natural resources, character, and ecology of a stream, stream segment, drainage area, or watershed for which agency and public review has been conducted pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW, the State Environmental Policy Act;

(o) A public or private project that is designed to improve fish or wildlife habitat or fish passage, when all of the following apply:

(i) The project has been approved in writing by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and has obtained all other required state and federal approvals;

(ii) The project has received hydraulic project approval by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to Chapter 77.55 RCW; and

(iii) The city has determined that the project is substantially consistent with the local shoreline master program. The city shall make such determination in a timely manner and provide it by letter to the project proponent.

(iv) Fish habitat enhancement projects that conform to the provisions of RCW 77.55.181 are determined to be consistent with local shoreline master programs, as follows:

(A) In order to receive the permit review and approval process created in this section, a fish habitat enhancement project must meet the criteria under subsections (2)(o)(iv)(A)(I) and (II) of this section:

(I) A fish habitat enhancement project must be a project to accomplish one or more of the following tasks:

• Elimination of human-made fish passage barriers, including culvert repair and replacement;

• Restoration of an eroded or unstable streambank employing the principle of bioengineering, including limited use of rock as a stabilization only at the toe of the bank, and with primary emphasis on using native vegetation to control the erosive forces of flowing water; or

• Placement of woody debris or other in-stream structures that benefit naturally reproducing fish stocks.

The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife shall develop size or scale threshold tests to determine if projects accomplishing any of these tasks should be evaluated under the process created in this section or under other project review and approval processes. A project proposal shall not be reviewed under the process created in this section if the Department determines that the scale of the project raises concerns regarding public health and safety,

(II) A fish habitat enhancement project must be approved in one of the following ways: 

• By the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to Chapter 77.95 or 77.100 RCW;

16.24.050 Statement of exemption.

Applicants for all other permits or approvals within the shoreline area must obtain a written statement of exemption from securing a substantial development permit. The process provides for verifying that the action is exempt and offers an applicant an itemization of SMP and other requirements applicable to the proposed project. In the case of development subject to the policies and regulations of this master program but exempt from the substantial development permit process, the building official or other permit authorizing official shall attach shoreline management terms and conditions to the building permits and other permits and approval pursuant to RCW 90.58.140. For example, the approval of a building permit for a single-family residence can be conditioned with provisions from the master program. Other permit approvals may be conditioned on the basis of SMP policy and use regulations as well. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).

(5) The time requirements for shoreline permits are as set forth in WAC 173-27-090, as now exists or as hereafter amended. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.081 Permit tracking procedure.

City staff will develop a tracking system to track all land use and development activity, including exemptions, within shoreline jurisdiction for the purposes of assessing cumulative effects of all development activities and how the city is meeting no net loss. A staff report will be assembled that provides basic project information, including location, permit type issued (including exemptions), project description, impacts, mitigation (if any), and monitoring outcomes as appropriate. Electronic records of tracked project information will be kept by the city and will be provided to Washington Department of Ecology upon request. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.24.085 Review criteria.

A substantial development permit, conditional use permit, or variance shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with the following:

(1) The policies of the Shoreline Management Act (Chapter 90.58 RCW);

(2) Goals, objectives, policies, and use regulations of the Normandy Park shoreline master program;

(3) Chapter 173-27 WAC, as now exists or as amended hereafter, Department of Ecology rules regarding permits for developments of shorelines;

(4) Normandy Park comprehensive plan; and

(5) NPMC Title 18, zoning code. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991. Formerly 16.24.090).


16.24.090 Review criteria for conditional use permits.

Conditional use permits shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with WAC 173-27-160, as stated below or as amended hereafter:

(1) Uses which are classified or set forth in a master program as conditional uses may be authorized; provided, that the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

(a) That the proposed use is consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the master program;

(b) That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines;

(c) That the proposed use of the site and design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and shoreline master program;

(d) That the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and

(e) That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.

(2) In the granting of all conditional use permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

(3) Other uses which are not classified or set forth in the applicable master program may be authorized as conditional uses provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this section and the requirements for conditional uses contained in the master program.

(4) Uses which are specifically prohibited by the master program may not be authorized pursuant to either subsection (1) or (2) of this section. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.24.095 Review criteria for variance permits.

The purpose of a variance permit is strictly limited to granting relief from specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the master program where there are extraordinary circumstances relating to the physical character or configuration of property such that the strict implementation of the master program will impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020.

Variance permits shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with WAC 173-27-170, as stated below or as amended hereafter.

(1) Variance permits should be granted in circumstances where denial of the permit would result in a thwarting of the policy enumerated in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances the applicant must demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

(2) Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), and/or landward of any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

(a) That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program precludes, or significantly interferes with, reasonable use of the property;

(b) That the hardship described in subsection (2)(a) of this section is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of the master program, and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant's own actions;

(c) That the design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and shoreline master program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment;

(d) That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area;

(e) That the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief; and

(f) That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

(3) Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), or within any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

(a) That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program precludes all reasonable use of the property;

(b) That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsections (2)(b) through (f) of this section; and

(c) That the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected.

(4) In the granting of all variance permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example if variances were granted to other developments and/or uses in the area where similar circumstances exist the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

(5) Variances from the use regulations of the master program are prohibited. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016).


16.24.100 Local appeal – Process.

(1) Appellant Action. Any person aggrieved by any interpretation, decision or action of the administrator may request review of that interpretation, decision or action by the Normandy Park hearing examiner. Such requests shall be made in writing to the administrator within 15 days of the interpretation, decision or action. The written request shall state clearly the basis for appeal.

(2) Administrator Action. Within seven working days of the administrator’s receipt of a request for appeal, the administrator shall forward to the hearing examiner the request for review, all pertinent documents and the administrator’s written analysis of the issues involved in the appeal. The administrator shall also send one copy of the analysis to the appellant and one copy to applicant, if different than the appellant.

(3) Shoreline Appeals Board Action. Within 30 days of receipt of the required materials for an appeal, the hearing examiner shall take one of the following actions at a public meeting:

(a) Grant the appeal, with or without conditions; or

(b) Deny the appeal, stating the reasons for the denial. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 833 § 6, 2009; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.110 State appeal – Process.

(1) State Shorelines Hearing Board Action.

(a) All appeals of any final permit decision are governed by the procedures established in RCW 90.58.180 and Chapter 461-08 WAC, the rules and procedures of the State Shorelines Hearing Board.

(b) All requests for review filed with the Department of Ecology must contain the items required by WAC 461-08-055. Such requests shall be filed with the Department of Ecology within 30 days of the date of filing in accordance with WAC 173-27-220, as now exists or as amended hereafter. DOE will certify the request for review to the Shorelines Hearing Board within 30 days of receipt of the request if it appears the request has set forth valid reasons to seek review. Failure of DOE to provide such certification does not preclude the requestor from obtaining certification from the Attorney General or from obtaining a review in the superior court under any right to review otherwise available. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.120 Revisions to substantial development, conditional use, and variance permits.

When a revision of a substantial development, conditional use or variance permit is sought, the applicant shall submit detailed plans and text describing the proposed changes in the permit and demonstrating compliance with the scope and intent of the original permit pursuant to WAC 173-27-100, as now exists or as amended hereafter:

(1) If the city determines that the proposed changes are within the scope and intent of the original permit, the city may approve a revision. “Within the scope and intent of the original permit” means all of the following:

(a) No additional over-water construction will be involved except that pier, dock, or float construction may be increased by 500 square feet or 10 percent from the provisions of the original permit, whichever is less;

(b) Ground area coverage and height of each structure may be increased a maximum of 10 percent from the provisions of the original permit;

(c) Additional separate structures may not exceed a total 250 square feet;

(d) The revised permit does not authorize development to exceed height, lot coverage, setback, or any other requirements of the applicable master program except as authorized under the original permit;

(e) Additional landscaping is consistent with conditions (if any) attached to the original permit and with the applicable master program;

(f) The use authorized pursuant to the original permit is not changed; and

(g) No substantial adverse environmental impact will be caused by the project revision.

(2) If the revision or the sum of the revision and any previously approved revisions violate the terms of one or more of the provisions itemized above, the applicant shall apply for a new shoreline permit in the manner provided herein.

(3) Within eight days of the date of final city action the revised site plan, text, and the approved revisions shall be submitted to the Department of Ecology and the Attorney General for their files. A notice of revision approval shall be forwarded to persons who have notified the shoreline administrator of their desire to receive a copy of the action on a permit pursuant to WAC 173-27-100, as now exists or as amended hereafter.

(4) If the revision to the original permit involves a conditional use or variance that was conditioned by the Department of Ecology, the city shall submit the revision to the Department of Ecology for the Department’s approval, approval with conditions, or denial. The revision shall indicate that it is being submitted under the requirements of WAC 173-27-100(6), as now exists or as amended hereafter. The Department of Ecology shall render and transmit to the city and the applicant its final decision within 15 days of the date of the Department’s receipt of the submittal from the city. The city shall notify parties of record of the Department’s final decision.

(5) The revised permit shall become effective immediately upon final action by the city or, when appropriate under WAC 173-27-100(7), as now exists or as amended hereafter, by the Department of Ecology.

(6) Appeals shall be in accordance with RCW 90.58.180 and shall be filed within 21 days from the date of receipt of the city’s action by the Department of Ecology or, when appropriate under WAC 173-27-100(7), as now exists or as amended hereafter, the date the Department’s final decision is transmitted to the city and the applicant. Appeals shall be based only upon contentions of noncompliance with the provisions of WAC 173-27-100(2), as now exists or as amended hereafter. Construction undertaken pursuant to that portion of a revised permit not authorized under the original permit is at the applicant’s own risk until the expiration of the appeals deadline. If an appeal is successful in proving the revision is not within the scope and intent of the original permit, the decision shall have no bearing on the original permit. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 710 § 1, 2003; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.130 Nonconforming development.

Nonconforming development is a shoreline use or structure which was lawfully constructed or established prior to the effective date of the Act or the master program, or amendments thereto, but which does not conform to present regulations or standards of the master program or policies of the Act. In such cases, the following standards shall apply:

(1) Nonconforming development may be continued; provided, that it is not enlarged, intensified, increased, or altered in any way which increases nonconformity;

(2) A nonconforming development which is moved any distance must be brought into conformance with the master program and the Act;

(3) If a nonconforming development is damaged to the extent of the replacement cost of the original development, it may be reconstructed to those configurations existing immediately prior to the time the development was damaged; provided, that application is made for the permits necessary to restore the development within one year of the date the damage occurred, all permits are obtained and the restoration is completed within three years of permit issuance;

(4) If a nonconforming use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months or for 12 months during any three-year period, the nonconforming rights shall expire and any subsequent use shall be conforming. A use authorized pursuant to subsection (6) of this section shall be considered a conforming use for purposes of this section;

(5) A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use, regardless of the conforming or nonconforming status of the building or structure in which it is housed;

(6) An undeveloped lot, tract, parcel, site, or division which was established prior to the effective date of the Act and the master program but which does not conform to the present lot size or density standards may be developed as long as such development conforms to other requirements of the master program and the Act;

(7) Structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use but which are nonconforming with regard to setbacks, buffers, or yards; area; bulk; height; or density may be maintained and repaired and may be enlarged or expanded; provided, that said enlargement does not increase the extent of nonconformity by further encroaching upon or extending into areas where construction or use would not be allowed for new development or uses;

(8) A use which is listed as a conditional use but which existed prior to adoption of the master program or any relevant amendment and for which a conditional use permit has not been obtained shall be considered a nonconforming use. A use which is listed as a conditional use but which existed prior to the applicability of the master program to the site and for which a conditional use permit has not been obtained shall be considered a nonconforming use;

(9) A structure for which a variance has been issued shall be considered a legal nonconforming structure and the requirements of this section shall apply as they apply to preexisting nonconformities; 

(10) A nonconforming structure which is moved any distance must be brought into conformance with the applicable master program and the Act. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.140 Enforcement and penalties.

(1) For the purposes of improving enforcement of this SMP program, the shoreline administrator shall monitor activities along the Normandy Park shoreline through as follows:

(a) Conduct a boat survey of the Normandy Park shoreline zone every six months to assess violations of this shoreline program. Provide an annual report of the results of these surveys to the city council. 

(b) Assess whether the city is achieving no net loss of shoreline ecological functions on an annual basis and cumulatively from the issue date of this shoreline program. The report shall include an analysis of impacts from development (and where possible including unpermitted actions) and how this is balanced by restoration actions within Normandy Park to achieve no net loss of ecological functions. This shall be reported annually to the city council.

(2) The choice of enforcement action and the severity of any penalty should be based on the nature of the violation and the damage or risk to the public or to public resources. The existence or degree of bad faith of the persons subject to the enforcement action, the benefits that accrue to the violator, and the cost of obtaining compliance may also be considered.

(a) RCW 90.58.210, Court actions to ensure against conflicting uses and to enforce – Civil penalty – Review, is incorporated in this section and will be enforced by the city.

(i) Except as provided in RCW 43.05.060 through 43.05.080 and 43.05.150, the attorney general or the attorney for the local government shall bring such injunctive, declaratory, or other actions as are necessary to ensure that no uses are made of the shorelines of the state in conflict with the provisions and programs of this chapter, and to otherwise enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(ii) Any person who shall fail to conform to the terms of a permit issued under this chapter or who shall undertake development on the shorelines of the state without first obtaining any permit required under this chapter shall also be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation. Each permit violation or each day of continued development without a required permit shall constitute a separate violation.

(iii) The penalty provided for in this section shall be imposed by a notice in writing, either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service, to the person incurring the same from the department or local government, describing the violation with reasonable particularity and ordering the act or acts constituting the violation or violations to cease and desist or, in appropriate cases, requiring necessary corrective action to be taken within a specific and reasonable time.

(iv) The person incurring the penalty may appeal within thirty days from the date of receipt of the penalty. The term “date of receipt” has the same meaning as provided in RCW 43.21B.001. Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section by the department shall be subject to review by the shorelines hearings board. Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section by local government shall be subject to review by the local government legislative authority. Any penalty jointly imposed by the department and local government shall be appealed to the shorelines hearings board.

(3) RCW 90.58.220, General penalty, is adopted in this code and enforced by the city.

In addition to incurring civil liability under RCW 90.58.210, any person found to have willfully engaged in activities on the shorelines of the state in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any of the master programs, rules, or regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine of not less than twenty-five nor more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than ninety days, or by both such fine and imprisonment: PROVIDED, That the fine for the third and all subsequent violations in any five-year period shall be not less than five hundred nor more than ten thousand dollars: PROVIDED FURTHER, That fines for violations of RCW 90.58.550, or any rule adopted thereunder, shall be determined under RCW 90.58.560.

(4) RCW 90.58.230, Violators liable for damages resulting from violation – Attorney’s fees and costs, is adopted in the code and enforced by the city.

Any person subject to the regulatory program of this chapter who violates any provision of this chapter or permit issued pursuant thereto shall be liable for all damage to public or private property arising from such violation, including the cost of restoring the affected area to its condition prior to violation. The attorney general or local government attorney shall bring suit for damages under this section on behalf of the state or local governments. Private persons shall have the right to bring suit for damages under this section on their own behalf and on the behalf of all persons similarly situated. If liability has been established for the cost of restoring an area affected by a violation the court shall make provision to assure that restoration will be accomplished within a reasonable time at the expense of the violator. In addition to such relief, including money damages, the court in its discretion may award attorney’s fees and costs of the suit to the prevailing party. 

(Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).


16.24.150 Additional authority.

In addition to any other powers granted hereunder, the city may:

(1) Acquire lands and easements within shorelines of the state by purchase, lease, or gift, either alone or in concert with other governmental entities, when necessary to achieve implementation of the master program;

(2) Accept grants, contributions, and appropriations for any agency, public or private, or individual for the purposes of the Act and the master program;

(3) Appoint advisory committees to assist in carrying out the purposes of the Act and the master program; 

(4) Contract for professional or technical services required by the city which cannot be performed by city employees;

(5) Make administrative decisions and interpretations of the policies and regulations of this SMP and the SMA; and

(6) The application of this program should be consistent with constitutional and other legal limitations on the regulation of private property. The administrator should give adequate consideration to mitigation measures, dimensional variances, and other possible methods to prevent undue or unreasonable hardships upon property owners. (Ord. 940 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 539 § 2, 1991).1

Code reviser’s note: Ordinance 940 adds this section as NPMC 16.24.010. It has been editorially renumbered to avoid duplication of numbering.

Chapter 17.10 LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS

Sections:

17.10.010    Purpose.

17.10.020    Scope.

17.10.030    Conceptual review.

17.10.040    Application.

17.10.050    Administrative review.

17.10.060    Final approval and recording required.


17.10.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to define the procedures and criteria for the review and approval of lot line adjustments, and to ensure compliance with the Survey Recording Act. A lot line adjustment is permitted so long as no new lots are created and no lot that results from the adjustment is either nonconforming or more nonconforming than before the adjustment. A lot line adjustment is not a substitute for compliance with the city’s subdivision ordinances. (Ord. 759 § 1, 2005).


17.10.020 Scope.

The lot line separating two contiguous lots of record may be adjusted only under the provisions of this chapter. A proposal for lot line adjustment shall not:

(1) Create any additional lot, tract, parcel or division site in contravention of NPMC 17.04.030; 

(2) Amend the conditions of approval for previously platted property;

(3) Involve lots that do not share a common lot line;

(4) Diminish or impair drainage, water supply, existing sanitary sewer disposal, access or easement for vehicles, utilities, or fire protection for any lot, tract, parcel, site, or division;

(5) Create or diminish any easement or deprive any parcel of access or utilities;

(6) Increase the nonconforming aspects of an existing nonconforming lot; or

(7) Circumvent the subdivision or short subdivision procedures set forth in this title. (Ord. 759 § 1, 2005).


17.10.030 Conceptual review. 

Prior to proceeding through the lot line adjustment process, an applicant may request an optional preapplication meeting, subject to a fee set by city council resolution or ordinance. At that meeting, the planning manager will review the proposal and make comments based on the information supplied by the applicant. A summary of the city’s comments will be provided to the applicant and kept on file with the city. (Ord. 759 § 1, 2005).


17.10.040 Application.

(1) Applications for lot line adjustments shall be reviewed by the planning manager for consistency with the city’s code and other applicable regulatory codes.

(2) Applications for lot line adjustments must be signed by all persons listed on the title report for each parcel altered by the proposed adjustment.

(3) Any adjustment of lot lines must be approved by the planning manager prior to the transfer of property ownership between adjacent legal lots.

(4) The elimination of lines between two or more lots shall be considered a lot line adjustment and shall not be subject to the subdivision or short subdivision provisions of this title.

(5) Recognized lots in an approved site plan for a conditional use permit, special use permit, planned residential development, or commercial site development permit shall be considered a single site. No lot lines on the site may be altered by a lot line adjustment to transfer density or separate lots to another property not included in the original site plan of the subject development. 

(6) Application forms provided by the city shall be submitted to the planning manager with one original and five copies of a plan, on Mylar or other medium acceptable to the county for recording, signed and stamped by a professional land surveyor, drawn to scale with accurate dimensions, clearly showing the following information:

(a) The proposed lines for all affected lots, indicated by heavy solid lines;

(b) The existing lot lines proposed to be changed, indicated by heavy broken lines;

(c) The location and dimensions of all structures and improvements on the affected lots and the distance between those structures and improvements and the proposed lot lines;

(d) Existing and proposed legal descriptions for each parcel, labeling the new parcels with designations different from existing parcels;

(e) The position of monumentation set at each new property corner;

(f) All assessor tax parcel numbers of affected lots;

(g) The location of the property to quarter/quarter sections;

(h) The location and dimensions of any drain field, easement, or right of-way existing within any affected lots;

(i) The area and dimensions of each lot following the proposed adjustment;

(j) The existing, and, if applicable, proposed future method of sewage disposal for each affected lot. 

The planning manager may request that existing and proposed descriptions be shown on separate sheets. A paper copy of the plan may be submitted for review and approval before submission of the final plan.

(7) Record of Survey for Lot Line Adjustments:

(a) The Mylar shall be titled on the top of the page, in larger capital letters, as follows:

RECORD OF SURVEY FOR LOT LINE ADJUSTMENT

(b) A note shall be placed on the Mylar that reads as follows:

THIS LOT LINE ADJUSTMENT IS NOT A PLAT, REPLAT, OR SUBDIVISION. IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE LOTS WILL BE SUITABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. THE LEGAL TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTY MUST BE DONE BY SEPARATE INSTRUMENT. 

(8) Lot line adjustment applications shall include a title report that sets forth all persons having an interest in the lots affected by the lot line adjustment. The title report must be dated no more than 30 days prior to application and must be updated to the date of lot line adjustment approval, without cost to the city.

(9) The Mylar for recording in the auditor’s office shall contain all survey information required for a record of survey under the “Survey Recording Act,” Chapters 58.09 RCW and 332-130 WAC, together with the following additional signature blocks, which shall be fully executed before approval:

Residing at:

My Commission Expires:

(11) An application for a lot line adjustment shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable planning review fee as set forth by city council resolution or ordinance. Applicant shall also be responsible for any direct engineering review costs. (Ord. 759 § 1, 2005).


17.10.050 Administrative review.

A completed application for a lot line adjustment shall be approved, returned to the applicant for modifications, or denied by the planning manager.

An application will be considered complete when it meets the requirements of NPMC 17.10.040, as determined by the planning manager. After receiving the completed application:

(1) The planning manager may forward a copy of the proposed lot line adjustment to the fire marshal, the Seattle-King County public health department or any other agency for review. 

(2) The city engineer shall review a copy of the proposed lot line adjustment for accuracy of legal descriptions, lot dimensions, and, if necessary, improvements on the lots. 

(3) If the planning manager determines that an application for lot line adjustment may impair drainage, water supply, existing sanitary sewage disposal, access or easement for vehicles, utilities, or fire protection for any lot, tract, parcel, site, or impact any previous land use decision, it shall refer the application to the appropriate agency for review.

(4) Following receipt of the comments of consulted departments under subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the city manager or designee shall approve or deny the requested adjustments.

(5) After approval, the applicant’s surveyor must record the survey of lot line adjustment, together with deeds of conveyance signed by parties disclosed in the title report when the adjusted lot line separates different ownerships. Proof of recording shall be delivered to the city. If the record of survey and required deeds of conveyance have not been recorded within 90 days of lot line approval, the lot line adjustment shall be void. 

(6) The approval of lot line adjustments shall not be a guarantee that future permits will be granted for any structure or development within a lot affected by the lot line adjustment. 

(7) Any person aggrieved by a decision of the city manager or designee on a lot line adjustment may appeal the decision to the hearing examiner as provided in Chapter 18.150 NPMC. (Ord. 924 § 2(F), 2015; Ord. 833 § 7, 2009; Ord. 759 § 1, 2005).


17.10.060 Final approval and recording required.

All persons having an ownership interest within the lot line adjustment shall sign the final recording document in the presence of a notary public. 

(2) Prior to final approval, documentation authorizing the transfer of property ownership shall be placed on the original lot line map along with the legal descriptions of those portions of the land being transferred when lots are under separate ownership. Lot lines within lots under the same ownership will be adjusted upon the recording of the lot line adjustment.

(3) Final record-of-survey document must be prepared by a land surveyor in accordance with Chapters 332-130 WAC and 58.09 RCW. The document must contain a land surveyor’s certificate and a recording certificate. (Ord. 759 § 1, 2005).

18.10.010 Purpose of zoning districts.

The city is divided into zoning districts established in this code with the intent to provide for the geographic distribution of land uses as contemplated by the city’s goals and policies; to maintain stability in land use commitments through the provision of harmonious groupings of uses possessing compatible characteristics and levels of activity; to maintain commitments in public service facilities such as transportation systems, parks and utilities; and to provide an efficient and compatible relationship of land uses and land use districts. (Ord. 743 § 1, 2004).


18.10.020 Establishment of zoning districts.

Land use districts in the city are hereby established as follows:

	District	Designation

	Low Density Multifamily Residential	R-5

	High Density Single-Family Residential	R-7.2

	Medium Density Single-Family Residential	R-12.5

	Low Density Single-Family Residential	R-15

	Low Density Single-Family Residential	R-20

	Medium Density Multifamily Residential	RM-1800

	High Density Multifamily Residential	RM-2400

	Neighborhood Center 	NC

	Mixed Use	MU

(Ord. 743 § 1, 2004).


18.10.030 Purpose of individual zoning districts. 

(1) R-20 – Low Density Single-Family. The primary purpose of the R-20 zone is to allow areas for the lowest density of single-family homes meeting the dimensional requirements in NPMC 18.15.020.

(2) R-15 – Low Density Single-Family. The primary purpose of the R-15 zone is to allow areas for a low density of single-family homes meeting the dimensional requirements in NPMC 18.15.020.

(3) R-12.5 – Medium Density Single-Family. The primary purpose of the R-12.5 zone is to allow areas for a medium density of single-family homes meeting the dimensional requirements in NPMC 18.15.020.

(4) R-7.2 – High Density Single-Family. The primary purpose of the R-7.2 zone is to allow areas for a higher density of single-family homes meeting the dimensional requirements in NPMC 18.15.020.

(5) R-5 – Low Density Multifamily. The primary purpose of the R-5 zone is to allow areas for court-type apartments or multiple dwelling units containing no more than four dwelling units meeting the dimensional requirements in NPMC 18.15.020.

(6) RM-2400 – Medium Density Multifamily. The principal objective and purpose to be served by this classification and its application is to allow areas to have greater population density than is allowed in more restrictive classifications, and at the same time to maintain a residential environment consistent with such greater population density. This classification permits accommodations for those who desire to live in a residential atmosphere without the necessity to individually maintain a dwelling unit. This is a medium density multifamily use meeting the dimensional requirements of NPMC 18.15.020.

(7) RM-1800 – High Density Multifamily. The principal objective and purpose to be served by this classification and its application is to allow areas to have greater population density than is allowed in more restrictive classifications, and at the same time to maintain a residential environment consistent with greater population density. This classification permits accommodations for those who desire to live in a residential atmosphere without the necessity to individually maintain a dwelling unit. This is a high density multifamily use meeting the dimensional requirements of NPMC 18.15.020.

(8) MU – Mixed Use. The purpose of the MU zone is to combine professional office, medical clinics, and business office, limited personal services, multiple-family residential, cottage style housing and related uses. Locations should be in proximity to transit use. Development should minimize impacts to adjacent single-family residential areas, where applicable. 

(9) NC – Neighborhood Center. The purpose of the NC zone is to combine shopping, business, and personal service activities into cohesive neighborhood focal points that promote pedestrian usage. As secondary uses, professional offices and multiple-family residential uses are encouraged to add vitality to the neighborhood centers. Locations should be in proximity to transit use. Development should provide safe and connected vehicular and pedestrian routes within and to the sites and minimize impacts to adjacent single-family residential areas, where applicable. Uses and buildings existing at the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be allowed to continue with their present use or form until such time as the use or building exterior is changed. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 743 § 1, 2004).


18.10.040 Use chart – Described.

In Chart 18.10.060, land use classifications are listed on the vertical axis and zoning districts are shown on the horizontal axis.

(1) If no symbol appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is not allowed in that district.

(2) If the symbol “P” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and row, the use is permitted subject to general requirements for the use and the zoning district.

(3) If the symbol “C” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is permitted subject to the conditional use provisions specified in NPMC 18.22.010 and to general requirements for the use and the zoning district.

(4) If a number appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is permitted through the applicable review process and subject to the special limitation indicated in the corresponding note. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 743 § 1, 2004).


18.10.050 Interpretation of use chart.

(1) In the case of a question as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use in a particular use category, the planning manager shall have the authority to make the final determination based on the characteristics of the operation of the proposed use and the planning manager’s interpretation of the Standard Land Use Coding Manual and the Standard Industrial Classification Manual.

(2) In the case of a conflict between the general description and the use chart, the chart shall prevail. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 743 § 1, 2004).

18.20.030 Variances.

Where practical difficulties exist rendering compliance with the provisions of this title impractical, and such compliance would create unnecessary hardships to the owner or user of land or buildings, the hearing examiner may grant a variance in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title or the building ordinance by varying the application of rules, regulations or provisions of this title or such ordinance relating to the use of land or structures and any construction, structural or equipment changes so long as the spirit and benefits of this title or the ordinance will be preserved. The hearing examiner shall not vary any of the rules, regulations or provisions of this title or the ordinance unless the hearing examiner, upon due and diligent investigation and after public hearing, finds that all of the following conditions exist in such case:

(1) That the variance does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property on behalf of which the application was filed is located;

(2) That such variance is necessary because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located;

(3) That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; and

(4) That the plight of the owner is not the result of the owner’s voluntary actions.

Variances authorized by this section shall be from the city’s bulk regulations and standards only.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the Growth Management Act and the Normandy Park Comprehensive Plan by establishing processes for the siting and expansion of essential public facilities in the city of Normandy Park as necessary to support orderly growth and delivery of public services. The city’s goal in promulgating the regulations under this chapter is to ensure the timely, efficient and appropriate siting of EPFs while simultaneously acknowledging and mitigating the significant community impacts often created by such facilities. Nothing in this chapter should be construed as an attempt by the city to preclude the siting of essential public facilities in contravention of applicable state law. (Ord. 817 § 2, 2008).


18.34.020 Siting or expansion of local essential public facilities.

(1) A conditional use permit shall be required as provided in this section before any local essential public facility (other than a secure community transition facility as defined in RCW 71.09.020) may be located or expanded within the city of Normandy Park, regardless of the zoning district in which such facility is or is proposed to be located.

(2) A complete application for a conditional use permit for a local essential public facility shall include all of the following items:

(a) The name, address, and telephone number of the public agency applying for the permit, together with the name, address, and telephone number of an individual contact within the agency;

(b) The address and legal description of the property on which the local essential public facility is proposed;

(e) A site plan drawn to a scale of not less than a one inch equals forty feet scale showing the property dimensions and the location of the local essential public facility and any and all existing and proposed structures on the property.

The planning and community services manager shall develop an application form which includes the above and which also addresses and provides sufficient information to judge the application’s compliance with each of the approval criteria set forth in subsection (4) of this section.

(3) A conditional use permit for a local essential public facility shall be processed as provided in Chapter 18.22 NPMC, except that the Normandy Park city council shall be the decision-making authority for all conditional use permits involving local essential public facilities. Notices of the required public hearing shall be posted on-site, posted at the city’s designated posting places, advertised in the city’s official newspaper, and mailed to property owners within 300 feet at least 10 days prior to such hearing.

(4) A conditional use permit for a local essential public facility shall be approved upon a determination that:

(a) The project sponsor has demonstrated a need for the project, as supported by a detailed written analysis of the projected service population, an inventory of existing and planned comparable facilities, and the projected demand for the type of facility proposed;

(b) The project sponsor has reasonably investigated alternative sites, as evidenced by a detailed explanation of site selection methodology, as verified by the city and reviewed by associated jurisdictions and agencies;

(c) Necessary infrastructure is or will be made available to ensure safe transportation access and transportation concurrency;

(d) Necessary infrastructure is or will be made available to ensure that public safety responders have capacity to handle increased calls or expenses that will occur as the result of the facility;

(e) The project sponsor has the ability to and shall pay for all capital costs associated with on-site and off-site improvements;

(f) The facility will not unreasonably increase noise levels in residential areas, especially at night;

(g) Visual screening will be provided that will mitigate the visual impacts from streets and adjoining properties. Visual screening must be of such quality and design as to complement the neighborhood in which the local essential public facility is located. Screening complements the neighborhood when it meets or exceeds the quality and design of other screening in the neighborhood;

(h) The local essential public facility will not be significantly detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use or be detrimental to the property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city; 

(i) The local essential public facility is not located in any residential (R or RM) zoning district identified in NPMC 18.10.030, except as provided in this subsection. If the land on which a local essential public facility is proposed is located in any such residential zoning district, the applicant must demonstrate to the Normandy Park city council that there is no other feasible location for the facility and that the exclusion of the facility from the residential districts of the city would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the city council shall authorize the essential public facility to be located in the residential zoning district;

(j) The local essential public facility meets all provisions of this code for development within the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, including but not limited to the general development requirements of Chapter 18.15 NPMC, except as provided in this subsection. If a local essential public facility does not meet all such provisions, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with such provisions would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the city council shall authorize the essential public facility to deviate from the provisions of this code to the minimum extent necessary to avoid preclusion;

(k) No local essential public facility shall be located within 600 feet of another essential public facility, except as provided in this subsection. If a local essential public facility is proposed to be located within 600 feet of another essential public facility, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with the separation requirement would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the city council shall authorize the essential public facility to deviate from the separation requirement to the minimum extent necessary to avoid preclusion; and

(l) Any and all probable significant adverse environmental impacts are mitigated.

(5) If the city council determines that any one or more of the decision criteria set forth in subsection (4) of this section is not met by the proposal, the city council shall impose such reasonable conditions on approval of the conditional use permit permit as may be necessary in order to enable the facility to meet the decision criteria.

(6) The decision criteria set forth in subsection (4) of this section shall not be applied in such a manner as to preclude the siting or expansion of any local essential public facility in the city of Normandy Park. In the event that a local essential public facility cannot, by the imposition of reasonable conditions of approval, be made to meet the decision criteria set forth in subsection (4) of this section on the preferred site described in the proposal, the city council shall either:

(a) Require the local essential public facility to be located on one of the investigated alternative sites, if the proposal can be reasonably conditioned to meet the decision criteria at the alternative site; or

(b) Approve the siting or expansion of the local essential public facility at the preferred site with such reasonable conditions of approval as may be imposed to mitigate the impacts of the proposal to the maximum extent practicable, if there is no available alternative site on which the decision criteria can be met. (Ord. 817 § 2, 2008).


18.34.030 Siting and expansion of state and regional essential public facilities.

(1) Any proposal for the siting or expansion of a state or regional essential public facility shall follow the procedures established by this code for the underlying permit, e.g., building permit, subdivision, binding site plan, etc.; provided, that a public hearing shall be held prior to the issuance of any such permit in order to obtain public input on the permit criteria and conditions of approval. If the underlying permit ordinarily requires a public hearing, the public hearing required by this section shall be consolidated with the required public hearing and heard by the same hearing body or officer. If the underlying permit does not ordinarily require a public hearing, the city council shall conduct the public hearing and shall thereafter be the approval authority for such underlying permit. Notice of the application and the required public hearing shall be given as provided in NPMC 18.34.020(3).

(2) State and regional essential public facilities shall not be located in any residential (R or RM) zoning district identified in NPMC 18.10.030 except as provided in this subsection. If the land on which a state or regional essential public facility is proposed is located in any such residential zoning district, the applicant must demonstrate to the city council that there is no other feasible location for the facility and that the exclusion of the facility from the residential districts of the city would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the city council shall authorize the essential public facility to be located in the residential zoning district.

(3) State and regional essential public facilities shall meet all provisions of this code for development within the zoning district in which they are proposed to be located, including but not limited to general development requirements of Chapter 18.15 NPMC, except as provided in this subsection. If a state or regional essential public facility does not meet all such provisions, the applicant must demonstrate to the city council that compliance with such provisions would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the city council shall authorize the essential public facility to deviate from the provisions of this code to the minimum extent necessary to avoid preclusion.

(4) No state or regional public facility shall be located within 600 feet of another essential public facility, except as provided in this subsection. If a state or regional essential public facility is proposed to be located within 600 feet of another essential public facility, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with the separation requirement would preclude the siting of all similar facilities anywhere within the city. If the applicant is able to make such a demonstration, the city council shall authorize the essential public facility to deviate from the separation requirement to the minimum extent necessary to avoid preclusion.

(5) The city council shall impose reasonable conditions upon the state or regional essential public facility in order to ensure that:

(a) Necessary infrastructure is or will be made available to ensure safe transportation access and transportation concurrency;

(b) Necessary infrastructure is or will be made available to ensure that public safety responders have capacity to handle increased calls or expenses that will occur as the result of the facility;

(c) The project sponsor has the ability to and shall pay for all capital costs associated with on-site and off-site improvements;

(d) The facility will not unreasonably increase noise levels in residential areas, especially at night;

(e) Visual screening will be provided that will mitigate the visual impacts from streets and adjoining properties. Visual screening must be of such quality and design as to complement the neighborhood in which the local essential public facility is located. Screening complements the neighborhood when it meets or exceeds the quality and design of other screening in the neighborhood; and

(f) Any and all probable significant adverse environmental impacts are mitigated.

(6) The city council shall not impose conditions in such a manner as to preclude the siting or expansion of any state or regional essential public facility in the city of Normandy Park. In the event that a state or regional essential public facility cannot, by the imposition of reasonable conditions of approval, be made to mitigate the impacts described in subsection (4) of this section, the city council shall approve the siting or expansion of the state or regional essential public facility with such reasonable conditions of approval as may mitigate such impacts to the maximum extent practicable. (Ord. 817 § 2, 2008).


18.34.040 Secure community transition facilities.

RCW 71.09.342 preempts any and all local regulations on the siting of secure community transition facilities as defined in RCW 71.09.020. Such facilities are therefore exempt from the provisions of this chapter and shall be sited as provided in Chapter 71.09 RCW. (Ord. 817 § 2, 2008).

(Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 752 § 1, 2005).


18.35.020 Definitions.

“Complainant” means a complaining property owner in the city of Normandy Park who alleges that a hedge located on the adjacent property of another is causing an unreasonable obstruction of preexisting views or sunlight. 

“Hedge” means a row of closely planted trees, shrubs or grasses forming a fence, screen or boundary. 

“Hedge owner” means the record owner of the real property on which a hedge is located. 

“Owner” means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, trust or other legal entity owning property in the city of Normandy Park. 

“Primary living or entertaining area” means an area located on the lot. The determination of primary living or entertaining area is to be made on a case-by-case basis. 

“Substantial obstruction of sunlight” means the loss of a substantial portion of direct or indirect sunlight in a primary living or entertaining area or in a significant portion of the complainant’s real property. 

“View” means an actual or potential vista. (Ord. 790 § 1, 2007; Ord. 752 § 1, 2005).


18.35.030 Design and ornamental features.

(1) Fences, both new and rebuilt, should be made of material such as masonry, ornamental metal, wood, or some combination thereof. The use of chain link fencing is prohibited in a front yard unless it is fully screened from view by year-round vegetation or is vinyl-coated with a neutral color (i.e., green, black, brown).

(2) Notwithstanding any required permits, the following may be constructed without a variance:

(a) A trellis added to the top of a fence up to two additional feet higher than the allowed height, but not more than a height of eight feet. 

(b) An arbor to a maximum height of nine feet over a gate, walkway or entrance. 

(c) Decorative or ornamental features such as, but not limited to, columns, posts or other vertical focal points, spaced no less than eight feet apart, up to two additional feet higher than the allowed height to a maximum height of eight feet. 

(d) An openwork name sign over a driveway.

(3) For purposes of regulation under this chapter, a trellis shall be considered to be a fence, subject to the same height limitations and permit requirements. A trellis that has a horizontal element wider than 36 inches measured perpendicular to the fence or trellis shall be considered an arbor, subject to an arbor’s siting requirements. (Ord. 752 § 1, 2005). 


18.35.040 Findings – Hedges.

This section is enacted in recognition of the importance of views and sunlight to properties within the city of Normandy Park and to provide a fair and structured mechanism for resolving hedge disputes relating to views and sunlight. This chapter is based upon the following findings which are adopted by the city council of Normandy Park. 

(1) It is in the interest of the public welfare, health and safety to establish standards for the resolution of view and sun obstruction claims and to establish a structure for resolution of such claims which will provide a reasonable balance between the values of hedge ownership and view and sunlight related values. 

(2) When a view or sunlight obstruction dispute arises, the parties should act reasonably to resolve the dispute through friendly communication, thoughtful negotiation, compromise and other traditional means. Those disputes which are not resolved through such means may be resolved by following the procedures established herein. 

(3) It is the intent of the city that the provisions of this chapter receive thoughtful and reasonable application. It is not the intent of the city to encourage clear-cutting or substantial denuding of any property of its trees by overzealous application of the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 790 § 2, 2007; Ord. 752 § 1, 2005).


18.35.041 Rights established. 

Hedges, or other plantings having a barrier, screen or partition nature, shall not be more than 10 feet in height when located within 10 feet of any adjacent owner’s property line; provided, that no hedge more than 10 feet in height and within 10 feet of the property line shall create a nuisance or safety hazard, or unreasonably interfere with access to sunlight and/or views enjoyed by the complainant. The provisions of NPMC 18.35.010(2) regarding restrictions on fence and hedge height at intersections shall apply. 

A person shall have the right to preserve and seek restoration of views or sunlight which existed at any time since they purchased, when such views or sunlight are from the primary living or entertainment area and have subsequently been unreasonably obstructed by the hedge. 

In order to establish such rights pursuant to this chapter, the person must follow the process established in this chapter. In addition to the rights described in this section, private parties have the right to seek remedial action for imminent danger caused by trees. (Ord. 790 § 3, 2007).


18.35.042 Process for resolution of obstruction disputes. 

The following process shall be used in the resolution of view and sunlight obstruction disputes: 

(1) Initial Reconciliation. A complainant who believes that hedge growth on the property of another has caused unreasonable obstruction of views or sunlight from a primary living or entertaining area shall notify the hedge owner in writing of such concerns. Notification should, if possible, be accompanied by a personal discussion to enable the complainant and hedge owner to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 

(2) Mediation. If the initial reconciliation attempt fails, the complainant shall propose mediation as a timely means to settle the obstruction dispute. Acceptance of mediation by the hedge owner shall be voluntary, but the hedge owner shall have no more than 30 days from service of notice to either accept or reject the offer of mediation. If mediation is accepted, the parties shall mutually agree upon a mediator within 10 days. It is recommended that the services of a professionally trained mediator be employed. Mediation may be arranged through the Seattle-King County Alternate Dispute Resolution Center. The mediation meeting may be informal. The mediation process may include the hearing of the viewpoints of lay or expert witnesses and shall include a site visit to the properties of the complainant and the hedge owner. The parties are encouraged to contact immediate neighbors and solicit input. The mediator shall consider the purposes and policies set forth in this chapter in attempting to help resolve the dispute. The mediator shall not have the power to issue binding orders for restorative action, but shall strive to enable the parties to resolve their dispute by written agreement in order to eliminate the need for binding arbitration or litigation. (Ord. 790 § 4, 2007).


18.35.043 Hedge claim preparation. 

(1) In the event that the initial reconciliation process fails, and mediation either is declined by the hedge owner or fails, the complainant must prepare a hedge claim and provide a copy to the hedge owner in order to pursue either binding arbitration or litigation under the authority established by this chapter. 

(2) A hedge claim shall consist of all of the following: 

(a) A description of the nature and extent of the alleged obstruction, including pertinent and corroborating physical evidence. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, photographic prints, negatives or slides. Evidence of the date of property acquisition by the complainant must be included; 

(b) The location of all hedges alleged to cause the obstruction, the address of the property upon which the hedges are located, and the present hedge owner’s name and address; 

(c) Evidence of the failure of initial reconciliation to resolve the dispute. The complainant must provide evidence that written attempts at reconciliation have been made and have failed. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of and receipts for certified or registered mail correspondence; 

(d) Evidence that mediation has been attempted and has failed, or has been declined by the hedge owner; 

(e) The specific restorative actions proposed by the complainant to resolve the unreasonable obstruction. (Ord. 790 § 5, 2007).


18.35.044 Binding arbitration. 

In those cases where the initial reconciliation process fails and where mediation is declined by the hedge owner or has failed, the complainant must offer in writing to submit the dispute to binding arbitration, and the hedge owner may elect binding arbitration. The hedge owner shall have 30 days from service of notice to accept or reject binding arbitration. If accepted, the parties shall agree on a specific arbitrator within 21 days, and shall indicate such agreement in writing. 

The arbitrator shall use the provisions of this chapter to reach a fair resolution of the dispute and shall submit a complete written report to the complainant and the hedge owner. The report shall include the arbitrator’s findings with respect to NPMC 18.35.042(1) and (2), a pertinent list of all mandated restorative actions with any appropriate conditions concerning such actions, and a schedule by which the mandates must be completed. Any decision of the arbitrator may be enforced by civil action by either party. A copy of the arbitrator’s report shall be filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 790 § 6, 2007).


18.35.045 Litigation. 

In those cases where binding arbitration is declined by the hedge owner, then civil action may be pursued by the complainant for resolution of the view or sunlight obstruction from the hedge under the provisions and guidelines set forth in this chapter. The complainant must state in the lawsuit that mediation and arbitration were offered and not accepted. A copy of any final resolution of the litigation shall be filed with the city clerk. (Ord. 790 § 7, 2007).


18.35.046 Apportionment of costs. 

(1) Mediation and Arbitration. The complainant and hedge owner shall each pay 50 percent of mediation or arbitration fees, unless they agree otherwise or allow the mediator or arbitrator discretion to allocate costs. 

(2) Restorative Action. The costs of restorative action shall be determined by mutual agreement or through mediation, arbitration, court decision or settlement. (Ord. 790 § 8, 2007).


18.35.047 Limitation. 

This chapter shall not be construed to affect obligations imposed by easements, covenants or agreements. (Ord. 790 § 9, 2007).


18.35.048 Application. 

(1) This chapter shall not apply to hedges located on property owned by the city (not including rights-of-way). Individuals who are adversely affected by hedges located on property owned by the city may approach the city for requested relief. The potential for obstruction of views or substantial obstruction of sunlight shall be considered by the city when planting hedges on property owned by the city. 

(2) This chapter shall not apply to hedges located within city rights-of-way. (Ord. 790 § 10, 2007).


18.35.050 Variance and appeal procedures.

(1) The city manager or designee may grant a variance from the height restrictions of this chapter for special needs such as, but not limited to, game courts or protective requirements; provided, that:

(a) The owner or representative of the owner shall submit a detailed plan and written presentation of reasons why the height restriction should be allowed to be exceeded;

(b) The city shall send, at the applicant’s expense, the request and its accompanying documents to all property owners in the surrounding area, as defined in subsection (6) of this section; and

(c) There is no written objection to the requested variance.

(2) The city manager or designee may conduct research to determine the need for a variance and any impacts on the surrounding area, and may request the advice of a consultant, whose services shall be payable by petitioner.

(3) If there is an objection in writing which cannot be resolved by agreement, the hearing examiner shall conduct a public hearing, with proper legal notice of the hearing to all property owners in the surrounding area as provided in Chapter 18.150 NPMC.

(4) The hearing examiner shall base his or her determination solely on the information furnished by the petitioner, the objector(s) and the city manager or designee, and shall not grant the variance unless the hearing examiner finds that the requested variance is reasonably required and will not unreasonably interfere with the rights of the objecting property owners.

(5) Any party aggrieved by a decision of the hearing examiner may appeal the decision to the King County superior court, following the procedure given in Chapter 18.150 NPMC.

(6) For the purposes of this variance procedure, the owners of surrounding properties shall be those owning properties adjacent to petitioner’s property, those across the street from any proposed fence and those within 100 feet of the proposed fence.

(7) The appellant shall pay in accordance with the appeals fee schedule established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 924 § 2(K), 2015; Ord. 833 § 9, 2009; Ord. 752 § 1, 2005).1

Code reviser’s note: In Fig. 1, the vertical measurement of “20 feet” was added editorially at the request of the city.

Article I. General Provisions


18.36.010 Purpose.

(1) The purpose of this critical areas ordinance is to designate and protect ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas in accordance with the Washington Growth Management Act (GMA), while also allowing for reasonable use of property and assuring the property rights of others. The city is inside an urban growth area of the GMA. 

(2) By limiting and regulating development and alteration of critical areas while reflecting local conditions and the priorities of Normandy Park, this chapter seeks to: 

(a) Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from injury, loss of life, or property damage due to landslides and steep slope failures, erosion, seismic events, or flooding; 

(b) Maintain healthy, functioning ecosystems through the protection of unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including ground and surface waters, wetlands, and fish and wildlife and their habitats, and to conserve the biodiversity of plants and animal species; 

(c) Direct activities not dependent on critical areas resources to less ecologically sensitive sites and mitigate unavoidable impacts to critical areas by regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas; and 

(d) Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts and the overall net loss of the functions and values of wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Where reasonably possible this chapter seeks to increase the functions and values of wetlands and fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. 

(3) This chapter is to be administered with flexibility and attention to site-specific characteristics. It is not the intent of this chapter to apply standards for undeveloped property to previously developed property currently in use, to make a parcel of property unusable by denying its owner reasonable use of the property or to prevent the provision of public facilities and services necessary to support existing development and that planned for by the community. 

(4) This chapter does not apply to activities that changed the character, size, or scope of any development prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, including the design and drainage, dredge, flood, fill, landscaping or otherwise altered critical areas. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.020 Best available science.

(1) Critical areas reports and decisions to alter critical areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and values of critical areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to reasonably preserve or enhance anadromous fish, such as salmon and bull trout, and their habitat. 

(2) The best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local, state, or federal natural resource agencies, a qualified scientific professional, or team of qualified scientific professionals that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-190-080 and 365-195-900 through 365-195-925, or as amended. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.030 Authority.

As provided herein, the city manager, or his or her designee, is given the authority to interpret and apply, and the responsibility to enforce, this chapter to accomplish the stated purpose. The city manager or designee is authorized to adopt administrative rules as necessary and appropriate to implement this chapter and to prepare and require the use of such forms as necessary for its administration. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.040 Abrogation and greater restrictions.

Any individual critical area adjoined by another type of critical area shall have the buffer and meet the requirements that provide the most protection to the critical areas involved. When any provision of this chapter or any existing regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflicts with this chapter, that which is more restrictive shall apply. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.050 Severability. 

If any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be judged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such order or judgment shall be confined in its operation to the controversy in which it was rendered. The decision shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any part thereof and to this end the provisions of each clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this chapter are hereby declared to be severable. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.060 Applicability and critical area mapping.

(1) The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands, all land uses and clearing development activity, and all structures and facilities in the city, whether or not a permit or authorization is required, and shall apply to every person, firm, partnership, corporation, group, governmental agency, or other entity that owns, leases, or administers land within the city. No person, company, agency, or applicant shall materially alter a critical area or buffer except as consistent with the purposes and requirements of this chapter, or without the written approval of the city manager or designee, describing specific improvements to the critical area that are based on best available science (BAS) and satisfy the “no net loss of functions and values” standards described in this chapter. 

(2) Approval of a permit or development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this chapter does not discharge the obligation of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 

(3) The approximate location and extent of critical areas may be shown on city critical area maps and on maps prepared by county, state, federal and other agencies. These maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. They are for reference only and do not provide a final critical areas designation. The applicant is responsible for determining the scope, extent and boundaries of any critical area to the satisfaction of the city manager or designee.

(4) Compliance with the provisions of this chapter does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements that may be required (for example, shoreline substantial development permits, HPA permits, Army Corps of Engineers Section 404 permits, NPDES permits). The applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, apart from the process established in this chapter. Where applicable, the city manager or designee will encourage use of information such as permit applications to other agencies or special studies prepared in response to other regulatory requirements to support required documentation submitted for critical areas review. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.070 Fees. 

Unless otherwise indicated in this chapter, the applicant shall be responsible for all permit fees as well as the initiation, preparation, submission, and expense of all required reports, assessment(s), studies, plans, reconnaissance(s), peer review(s) by qualified consultants, and other work prepared in support of or necessary to review the application. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).

Mitigation for individual actions may include a combination of these measures. 

(1) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 

(2) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps, such as project redesign, relocation, or timing, to avoid or reduce impacts; 

(3) Rectifying the impact to wetlands, critical aquifer recharge areas, and habitat conservation areas by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment to a no net loss of functions and values standard or the conditions existing at the time of the initiation of the project; 

(4) Minimizing or eliminating the hazard by restoring or stabilizing the hazard area through engineered or other methods; 

(5) Reducing or eliminating the impact or hazard over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action; 

(6) Compensating for the impact to wetlands, critical aquifer recharge areas, and habitat conservation areas by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; or contributing funding to a city identified critical area project;

(7) Monitoring the hazard or other required mitigation and taking remedial action when necessary. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.170 Mitigation requirements.

(1) Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, if alteration to the critical area or buffer is unavoidable, all adverse impacts to or from critical areas and buffers resulting from a development proposal or alteration shall be mitigated in accordance with an approved critical areas report. Critical area functions can be used to help set targets (species composition, structure, etc.) for managed areas, including mitigation sites.

(2) Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, mitigation should be on site. When it can be demonstrated by a mitigation report that impacts to functions and values can be better mitigated off site, the off-site compensation shall occur within the same drainage basin in the same watershed where the habitat or wetland loss occurs; provided, that Category IV wetlands may be replaced outside of the watershed if there is no reasonable alternative. In such instances, the stormwater storage function provided by Category IV wetlands must be provided for within the design of the development project. Off-site compensation can be allowed only under one or more of the following circumstances:

(a) An alternative compensation project is proposed pursuant to NPMC 18.36.340(8);

(b) On-site compensation is not feasible due to hydrology, soils, or other factors;

(c) On-site compensation is not practical due to probably adverse impacts from surrounding land uses or would conflict with a federal, state or local public policy directive;

(d) Potential functions and values at the site of the proposed restoration are greater than the lost habitat or wetland functions and values;

(e) When the critical area to be altered is of a limited function and value and is degraded, compensation shall be of the habitat or wetland community types needed most in the location of the compensation and those most likely to succeed with the highest functional value possible.

(3) Mitigation shall be sufficient to maintain the functions and values of the critical area, and to prevent risk from a hazard posed by a critical area. 

(4) Mitigation shall not be implemented until after city review of a critical areas report that includes a mitigation plan, and mitigation shall be in accordance with the provisions of the approved critical areas report. 

(5) Where feasible, mitigation projects shall be completed prior to activities. Mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance as practicable and prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to fish, wildlife and flora. 

(6) The city manager or designee may authorize a one-time temporary delay, up to 120 days, in completing minor construction and landscaping when environmental conditions could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties. The delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation, and the delay shall not be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare of the public. The request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the mitigation plan. The justification must be verified and approved by the city manager or designee.

(7) Mitigation Plan. When mitigation is required, the applicant shall submit for approval by the city a mitigation plan, prepared by a qualified professional, as part of the critical areas report. The mitigation plan shall include: 

(a) Environmental Goals and Objectives. The mitigation plan shall include a written report identifying environmental goals and objectives of the compensation proposed and including: 

(i) A description of the anticipated impacts to the critical areas and the mitigating actions proposed and the purposes of the compensation measures, including the site selection criteria; identification of compensation goals; identification of resource functions; and dates for beginning and completion of site compensation construction activities. The goals and objectives shall be related to the functions and values of the impacted critical area; 

(ii) A review of the best available science supporting the proposed mitigation and a description of the report author’s experience to date in restoring or creating the type of critical area proposed; and 

(iii) An analysis of the likelihood of success of the compensation project. 

(b) Performance Standards. The mitigation plan shall include measurable specific criteria for evaluating whether or not the goals and objectives of the mitigation project have been successfully attained and whether or not the requirements of this chapter have been met. 

(c) Detailed Construction Plans. The mitigation plan shall include written specifications and descriptions of the mitigation proposed, such as: 

(i) The proposed construction sequence, timing, and duration; 

(ii) Grading and excavation details; 

(iii) Erosion and sediment control features; 

(iv) A planting plan specifying plant species, quantities, locations, size, spacing, and density; and 

(v) Measures to protect and maintain plants until established. 

(d) Written specifications shall be accompanied by detailed site diagrams, scaled cross-sectional drawings, topographic maps showing slope percentage and final grade elevations, and any other drawings appropriate to show construction techniques or anticipated final outcome. 

(e) Monitoring Program. The mitigation plan shall include a program for monitoring construction of the compensation project, and for assessing a completed project. A protocol shall be included outlining the schedule for site monitoring (for example, monitoring shall occur in years one, three and five after site construction), and how the monitoring data will be evaluated to determine if the performance standards are being met. A monitoring report shall be submitted as needed to document milestones, successes, problems, and contingency actions of the compensation project. The compensation project shall be monitored for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but not for a period less than five years. For wetland mitigation projects, 10 years or more of monitoring are needed for proposed forested and shrub-scrub communities with monitoring reports submitted in years one, two, three, five, seven and 10.

(f) Contingency Plan. The mitigation plan shall include identification of potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken if monitoring or evaluation indicates project performance standards are not being met. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 939 § 7, 2016; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).

The notice shall state the presence of the critical area or buffer on the property, of the application of this chapter to the property, and the fact that limitations on actions in or affecting the critical area or buffer may exist. The notice shall run with the land. 

(2) The applicant shall submit proof that the notice has been filed for public record before the city approves any site development or construction for the property or, in the case of subdivisions, short subdivisions, planned unit developments, and binding site plans, at or before recording. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.200 Critical areas tracts.

(1) Critical areas tracts shall be used in development proposals for subdivisions, planned unit developments, and binding site plans to delineate and protect those contiguous critical areas and buffers listed below that total 5,000 or more square feet. For short plats and single lots critical areas may be set aside and designated by a conservation easement for any critical area (no minimum number of square feet): 

(a) All landslide hazard areas and buffers; 

(b) All wetlands and buffers; 

(c) All fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and buffers; and 

(d) All other lands to be protected from alterations as conditioned by project approval.

(2) Critical areas tracts and conservation easements shall be recorded on all documents of title of record for all affected lots. 

(3) Critical areas tracts shall be designated on the face of the plat or recorded drawing in a format approved by the city attorney. The designation shall include the following restriction: 

(a) An assurance that native vegetation will be preserved for the purpose of preventing harm to property and the environment, including, but not limited to, controlling surface water runoff and erosion, maintaining slope stability, buffering, and protecting plants, fish and wildlife habitat; and 

(b) The right of the city to enforce the terms of the restriction. 

(4) Critical area tracts may be dedicated to the city, held in an undivided interest by each owner of a building lot within the development with the ownership interest passing with the ownership of the lot, or held by an incorporated homeowner’s association or other legal entity (such as a land trust, which ensures the ownership, maintenance, and protection of the tract). 

(5) Critical area tract areas may be utilized and assigned to new lots or units on the face of the plat or recorded survey document for credit in computing allowable lot or unit densities and coverages. 

(6) Critical area tracts and conservation easements may be altered or extinguished in the same manner and process described in this section to create critical area tracts or conservation easements. All grantees and grantors or their successors involved in the creation of these tracts or easements must agree to alter or extinguish them. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.210 Structure setback.

A structure setback of 10 feet shall be provided from the edge of any critical area or critical area buffer, if required, for maintenance access unless it can be demonstrated in the critical area study that building construction and long-term maintenance can be achieved without encroaching upon the critical area or its buffer. The following may be allowed in the structure setback:

(1) Vegetative landscaping;

(2) Uncovered pervious decks;

(3) Building overhangs if such overhangs do not extend more than 36 inches into the structure setback;

(4) Pervious ground surface, such as driveways and patios. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.220 Subdivisions, short subdivisions, planned unit developments and binding site plans.

The subdivision and short subdivision of land in wetlands, landslide hazard areas, habitat conservation areas and associated buffers is subject to the following: 

(1) Land that is located wholly within a wetland, landslide hazard area, habitat conservation area or its buffer may not be subdivided. 

(2) Land that is located partially within a wetland, landslide hazard area, habitat conservation area or its buffer may be subdivided; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new lot is: 

(a) Located outside of the wetland, landslide hazard area, habitat conservation area and its buffer; and 

(b) New lots must meet the minimum lot size requirements, including critical areas and buffers; and 

(c) Meet the minimum building pad size under NPMC 17.40.040. 

(3) Access roads and utilities serving the proposed subdivision may be permitted within the wetland, landslide hazard area, habitat conservation area and associated buffers only if the city determines that no other feasible alternative exists and when consistent with this chapter. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.230 Security to ensure mitigation, maintenance, and monitoring.

(1) When mitigation required pursuant to a development proposal is not completed prior to the city final permit approval, such as final plat approval or final building inspection, or when planting or other mitigation has begun and the five-year monitoring period is not complete, the city shall require of the applicant an assignment of funds or post a performance bond or other security in a form and amount deemed acceptable by the city. If the development proposal is subject to mitigation, the applicant shall post mitigation security in a form and amount deemed acceptable by the city to ensure mitigation is fully functional. 

(2) The security shall be in the amount of 150 percent of the estimated cost of the uncompleted actions or the estimated cost of restoring the functions and values of the critical area that are at risk, whichever is greater. The estimated costs prepared by a qualified professional shall be submitted for city review and approval prior to executing an assurance device. Cost needs to include labor, materials, taxes and other expenses. 

(3) The security shall be in the form of assignment of funds, a surety bond, performance bond, assignment of savings account, or an irrevocable letter of credit guaranteed by an acceptable financial institution with terms and conditions acceptable to the city attorney. 

(4) Security authorized by this section shall remain in effect until the city determines, in writing, that the standards bonded for have been met. Sufficient security may be held by the city for a minimum of five years to ensure that the required mitigation has been fully implemented and demonstrated to function, and may be held for longer periods when necessary. 

(5) Depletion, failure, or collection of security funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration. 

(6) Public development proposals shall be relieved from having to comply with the security requirements of this section if public funds have previously been committed for mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration of the specific proposal. 

(7) Pursuant to the monitoring program required by NPMC 18.36.170(7)(e), yearly, or as otherwise required, monitoring reports prepared by qualified professionals must be submitted. Any failure to satisfy critical areas requirements established by law or condition including, but not limited to, the failure to provide a monitoring report within 45 days after it is due or comply with other provisions of an approved mitigation plan shall constitute a default, and the city may demand payment of any financial guarantees or require other action authorized by the city code or any other law. 

(8) Any funds recovered pursuant to this section shall be used to complete the required mitigation. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.240 Unauthorized critical areas alterations and enforcement.

(1) Unauthorized Alteration. When a critical area or its buffer has been altered in violation of this chapter, all ongoing development work shall stop and the critical area and buffer shall be restored. 

(a) The city shall have the authority to issue a stop work order to cease all ongoing development work, and order restoration, rehabilitation or replacement measures at the responsible party’s expense to compensate for violation of provisions of this chapter. At a minimum, the structural and functional values of the critical area shall be restored and any hazard shall be reduced to a level equal to, or less than, the predevelopment conditions. 

(b) All development work shall remain stopped until a restoration plan, prepared in accordance with NPMC 18.36.170, has been approved by the city. Such a plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional. The city may, at the violator’s expense, seek expert advice in determining the adequacy of the plan. Inadequate plans will be returned to the applicant or violator for revision and resubmittal. 

(2) Site Inspections. The city manager or designee is authorized to make site inspections and take such actions as necessary to enforce this chapter. The city manager or designee shall present proper credentials and make a reasonable effort to contact any property owners before entering onto private property. 

(3) Penalties. Any person, party, firm, corporation, or other legal entity convicted of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished as provided in NPMC 1.04.010. In addition to any applicable fines or imprisonment, the court may order the violator to restore any critical area or buffer altered in violation of this chapter and may require the replacement of trees removed in violation of this chapter in the ratios set forth for voluntary correction agreements below. 

Each day or portion of a day during which a violation of this chapter is committed or continued shall constitute a separate offense. Any development carried out contrary to the provisions of this chapter constitutes a public nuisance and may be abated or enjoined as provided under the statutes of the state of Washington. For voluntary correction agreement, see subsection (4) of this section. 

(4) Voluntary Correction Agreements. 

(a) In lieu of proceeding under subsection (3) of this section, a voluntary correction agreement meeting the requirements of this subsection may be used to correct violations at the sole discretion of the city manager or his designee. 

(b) The city manager or designee shall make a prompt and reasonable attempt to secure voluntary correction by contacting the person responsible for the violation where possible, explaining the violation and requesting correction. 

(c) Voluntary correction agreements shall, whenever possible, be entered into by the person responsible for the violation and the city, acting through the city manager or designee, within 14 days after discovery of the violation by the city. 

(d) A voluntary correction agreement is a contract between the city and the person responsible for the violation under which such person agrees to abate the violation within a specified time and according to specified conditions. The voluntary correction agreement shall include the following: 

(i) The name and address of the person responsible for the violation; and 

(ii) The street address or a description sufficient for the identification of the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation has occurred or is occurring; and 

(iii) A description of the violation and a reference to the provision(s) of the city ordinance or code which has been violated; and 

(iv) The necessary corrective action to be taken, and a date or time by which the correction must be completed; and 

(v) In the case of trees cleared, cut down, damaged, or removed in violation of this chapter, a tree replacement plan that provides for the planting of replacement trees according to the following table: 

	Diameter of Tree Removed*	Number of Replacement Trees**

	4" to 6" (single trunk)

2" (any one trunk of a multiple trunk tree)	3 

	6" to 8"	4 

	8" to 20"	6 

	Over 20"	8 

* Measured at height of three feet from ground level 

** Minimum size of each replacement tree shall be a five-gallon container for deciduous trees, six to eight feet in height for coniferous and broadleaf evergreen trees 

In the case of deciduous trees that readily coppice, replacement may be waived by the city manager if the tree is appropriately maintained to promote regrowth. 

In the case of hazardous trees removed, trees may be replaced in-kind and at a replacement ratio of one-to-one. 

The city manager may agree upon alternate mitigation in the event that tree replacement at the ratios set forth in the table is not feasible on the property on which the violation was committed. In such a case, the city manager may accept a fee in lieu of replacement in the amount of up to $750.00 for each replacement tree not planted. All monies collected as fees in lieu of replacement shall be placed in a fund by the city and used for the planting of trees in Normandy Park; and 

(vi) Payment of a monetary penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per day for each day in which the violation was committed or continued, plus an additional penalty of:

(A) Up to $750.00 for each tree cleared, cut down, damaged, or removed, or for each act of clearing, cutting, damaging, or removing vegetation;

(B) Up to triple the value of each tree cleared, cut down, damaged, or removed, or of the vegetation cleared, damaged, or removed. The value shall be the replacement value as determined under the methods described in the Guide for Establishing Value of Trees and Other Plants, published by the International Association of Arboriculture, as now or hereafter amended. 

The actual amount of the penalties is to be agreed to by the city manager based on the seriousness of the violation and the responsiveness or lack of responsiveness of the violator; and 

(vii) An agreement by the person responsible for the violation that the city may enter upon the property and abate the violation, and may recover its costs, expenses, attorney’s fees, and the monetary penalty provided in this section if the terms of the voluntary correction agreement are not met.

(5) Abatement by the City.

(a) The city may abate a condition which was caused by or continues to be a violation when: 

(i) The terms of a voluntary correction agreement have not been met; or 

(ii) A notice of civil violation has been issued and the required correction has not been completed by the date specified; or 

(iii) Whenever any violation of a regulation causes a condition the continued existence of which constitutes an immediate and emergent threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment, the city may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. 

(b) Authorized Action by the City. Using any lawful means, the city may enter upon the subject property and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The city may seek such judicial process as it deems necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition. 

(c) Recovery of Costs and Expenses. The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting the violation shall be billed to the person responsible for the violation and/or the owner, lesser, tenant or other person entitled to control, use and/or occupy the property and shall become due and payable to the city at the permit center within 10 calendar days. The term “incidental expenses” includes but shall not be limited to personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney’s fees; costs incurred in documenting the violation; hauling, storage and disposal expenses; and actual expenses and costs of the city in preparing notices, specifications and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and inspecting the work; and the costs of any required printing and mailing. 

(6) Additional Enforcement Procedures. The provisions of this section are not exclusive, and may be used in addition to other enforcement provisions authorized by the Normandy Park Municipal Code except as precluded by law. 

(7) Severability. If any one or more sections, subsections or sentences of this chapter are held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this chapter and the same shall remain in full force and effect. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 839 § 1, 2009; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).

Article II. Wetlands 


18.36.310 Wetlands designation and classification. 

(1) Wetlands Designation. Wetlands are designated in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

(a) Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway.

(b) Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands.

(2) Wetlands Classification. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Department of Ecology 2014, or as revised). This document contains the definitions, methods and a rating form for determining the categorization and habitat score of wetlands described below:

Category I wetlands include those that receive a score of greater than or equal to 23 points based on functions, or those that are rated Category I based on special characteristics, including large estuarine wetlands, as defined in the rating form.

Category II wetlands include those that receive a score of 20 points through 22 points based on functions, or those that are rated Category II based on special characteristics, including smaller estuarine wetlands, as defined in the rating form.

Category III wetlands include those that receive a score of 16 points through 19 points based on functions.

Category IV wetlands score less than 16 points based on functions. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.320 Additional critical areas report requirements. 

In addition to the general critical areas report requirements of NPMC 18.36.150, critical areas reports for wetlands must meet the requirements of this section. Critical areas reports for two or more types of critical areas must meet the report requirements for each relevant type of critical area. 

(1) Area Addressed in Critical Areas Report. The following areas shall be addressed in a critical areas report for wetlands: 

(a) The project area of the proposed activity; 

(b) All wetlands and recommended buffers within 300 feet of the project area; and 

(c) All shoreline areas, water features, floodplains, and other critical areas and related buffers within 300 feet of the project area. 

(2) Wetland Analysis. In addition to the minimum required contents of NPMC 18.36.150, Critical areas report, a critical areas report for wetlands shall contain an analysis of the wetlands including the following site- and proposal-related information: 

(a) A written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers within 300 feet of the project area, including the following information:

(i) Wetland delineation and required buffers; 

(ii) Existing wetland acreage; 

(iii) Wetland category; 

(iv) Vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics; 

(v) Soil and substrate conditions; 

(vi) Topographic elevations, at two-foot contours; and 

(vii) A discussion of the water sources supplying the wetland and documentation of hydrologic regime (locations of inlet and outlet features, water depths throughout the wetland, evidence of recharge or discharge, evidence of water depths throughout the year – drift lines, algal layers, moss lines, and sediment deposits). 

(b) A discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization, and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing wetlands and restore any wetlands that were degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity. 

(c) A habitat and native vegetation conservation strategy that addresses methods to protect and enhance on-site habitat and wetland functions. 

(d) Functional evaluation for the wetland and adjacent buffer using a local or state agency staff-recognized method and including the reference of the method and all data sheets, including wetland delineation and rating documentation per the requirements of NPMC 18.36.310(1) and (2). (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.330 Performance standards.

(1) Activities and uses shall be prohibited from wetlands and wetland buffers, except as provided for in this chapter. Activities may only be permitted in a wetland or wetland buffer if the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas, or that the impacts to the functions and values will be fully mitigated.

(2) The following wetlands may be exempt from the requirements to avoid impacts (NPMC 18.36.160), and they may be filled if the impacts are fully mitigated based on the remaining actions in NPMC 18.36.160. If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of credits from an in-lieu fee program or mitigation bank, consistent with the terms and conditions of the program or bank. In order to verify the following conditions, a critical area report meeting the requirements of NPMC 18.36.320 must be submitted.

(a) All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet that:

(i) Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers;

(ii) Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers;

(iii) Are not part of a wetland mosaic, as defined by the Washington Department of Ecology;

(iv) Do not score six or more points for habitat function based on the 2014 update to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology); and

(v) Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a priority species identified by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species of local importance identified in NPMC 18.36.610.

(b) Wetlands less than 1,000 square feet that meet the above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this chapter.

(3) Wetland Buffers.

(a) Standard Buffer Widths.

(i) The standard buffer widths presume the existence of a relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If the vegetation is inadequate then the buffer width shall be increased or the buffer should be planted to maintain the standard width.

(ii) Standard wetland buffer widths, based on wetland category and habitat score are shown in Table 18.36.330-1, below.

Table 18.36.330-1. Standard Wetland Buffers 

	 	Buffer Width According to Habitat Score

	Wetland Category1	3 – 5 points	6 – 7 points	8 – 9 points

	Category I: Based on total score	75 ft	110 ft	225 ft

	Category I: Wetlands with a high conservation value	190 ft	225 ft

	Category I: Estuarine and coastal lagoons	150 ft (buffer width not based on habitat scores)

	Category II: Based on total score	75 ft	110 ft	225 ft

	Category II: Estuarine and coastal lagoons 	110 ft (buffer width not based on habitat scores)

	Category III	60 ft	110 ft	225 ft

	Category IV	40 ft

1. All categories are as defined in the 2014 Wetland Rating System.

(A) For wetlands that score six points or more for habitat function, the buffers in Table 18.36.330-1 can be used if both of the following criteria are met:

(I) All of the measures in Table 18.36.330-2 are implemented, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land use; and

(II) If an existing, relatively undisturbed vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide exists between the on-site wetland and other priority habitats, as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the off-site portion of the corridor is already protected via an existing conservation easement, critical areas regulations, or other legal requirement, the portion of the corridor on site must also be protected by a similar legal protection. The evaluation of presence or absence of the conditions described above must be completed as part of the critical areas report.

If no such corridor is present to protect, the standard buffers may be used with the measures in Table 18.36.330-2 alone.

Table 18.36.330-2. Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands 

	Examples of Disturbance	Examples of Activities that Cause the Disturbance	Examples of Measures to Minimize Impacts

(B) For wetlands that score three to five habitat points, only the measures in Table 18.36.330-2 are required to use the buffers in Table 18.36.330-1.

(C) If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 18.36.330-2, or if an option for protection of a corridor, as defined under subsection (3)(a)(ii)(A)(II) of this section, exists on the parcel, but is not provided, the buffer widths in Table 18.36.330-3 must be used.

Table 18.36.330-3. Increased Wetland Buffers If Table 18.36.330-2 Is Not Implemented or Corridor Not Provided  

	 	Buffer Width according to Habitat Score

	Wetland Category1	3 – 5 points	6 – 7 points	8 – 9 points

	Category I: Based on total score	100 ft	150 ft	300 ft

	Category I: Wetlands with a high conservation value	250 ft	300 ft

	Category I: Estuarine and coastal lagoons	200 ft (buffer width not based on habitat scores)

1. All categories are as defined in the 2014 Wetland Rating System.

(b) Measurement of Wetland Buffers. Buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The buffer for a wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland.

(c) Where a legally established and constructed public roadway transects a wetland buffer, the city manager or designee may approve a modification of the buffer width to the edge of the roadway provided:

(i) The isolated part of the buffer does not provide additional protection of the wetland; and

(ii) The isolated part of the buffer provides insignificant biological, geological or hydrological buffer functions relating to the wetland; and

(iii) If the remaining buffer distance is less than 50 percent of the standard or optional buffer for the applicable wetland category, no further reduction shall be allowed.

(d) Where a buffer has been previously established after 1996, through a city development review and is permanently recorded on title or placed within a separate tract, the buffer shall be as previously established.

(e) Buffer Width Increasing. The city may require the buffer to be increased by the greater of 50 feet or a distance necessary to protect wetland functions and provide connectivity to other wetland and habitat areas for one of the following:

(i) Where inadequate vegetation is present and the buffer is not planted, see subsection (3)(a)(i) of this section.

(ii) To maintain viable populations of existing species listed by the federal or state government as endangered, threatened or sensitive; or

(iii) To protect wetlands against severe erosion that standard erosion control measures will not effectively address; or

(iv) When a Category I, II or III wetland is located within 300 feet of:

(A) Another Category I, II, or III wetland;

(B) A fish and wildlife habitat conservation area, including a type S or F stream as defined in NPMC 18.36.620;

The increased buffer distance may be limited to those areas that provide connectivity or are necessary to protect wetland and habitat functions. If the wetland contains variations in sensitivity, increasing the buffer widths will only be done where necessary to preserve the structure, function and value of the wetland.

(f) Wetland Buffer Width Averaging. Buffer width averaging may be allowed by the city if all of the following criteria are met:

(i) It will provide additional protection to wetlands or enhance their functions, as long as the total area contained in the buffer on the development proposal site does not decrease;

(ii) The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places; and

(iii) The buffer width is not reduced to less than 25 percent of the buffer width at any location.

(g) Repealed by Ord. 997.

(h) Buffer Conditions Shall Be Maintained. Except as otherwise specified or allowed in accordance with this chapter, wetland buffers shall be retained in an undisturbed condition or maintained to conform to the conditions agreed to in the approved application.

(4) Signs and Fencing of Wetlands.

(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the wetland or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and inspected by the city manager or designee prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.

(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any development permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the city shall require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a wetland or buffer.

(i) Permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability.

(ii) Signs must be posted at an interval of two per lot or every 100 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity.

(iii) The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the city:

Protected Wetland Area Do Not Disturb Contact City of Normandy Park Regarding Uses and Restriction

(c) Fencing.

(i) The city shall condition any development permit or authorization to require the applicant to install a permanent fence at the edge of the wetland buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts to the wetland. Fencing should be of a natural style, such as split rail.

(ii) Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat.

(iii) Any area already landscaped as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter does not need to be fenced. The fencing shall be placed at the outer edge of the landscaping that is included in the buffer. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.340 Wetland mitigation requirements.

(1) Mitigation and mitigation plans shall be developed consistent with this code and the Department of Ecology Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans, 2006, or as revised. 

(2) Compensatory Mitigation General Provisions. 

(a) Wetland impacts shall be replaced with the same or higher category of wetland. 

(b) Compensatory mitigation shall be conducted on property which shall be protected and managed to avoid further loss or degradation. The applicant or violator shall provide for long-term preservation of the compensation area. 

(c) Compensatory mitigation shall follow an approved mitigation plan pursuant to NPMC 18.36.170. 

(d) Types of compensatory mitigation that may be allowed include restoration, establishment (creation), and enhancement as defined in Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance, 2006, or as revised.

(e) Compensation shall be completed prior to, or concurrently with, wetland loss, or, in the case of an enforcement action, prior to further development of the site. 

(3) Mitigation Ratios. 

(a) Any person who alters or proposes to alter regulated wetlands shall restore or create areas of wetland in order to compensate for wetland losses. The wetlands to be created or restored shall be in-kind (i.e., the same type of wetland) and accomplished prior to or concurrently with loss. The ratio of lost wetlands to newly created or restored shall be determined in accordance with Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 1: Agency Policies and Guidance, 2006, or as revised. 

(b) Mitigation ratios shall be in accordance with Wetlands in Washington State, Volume 2, Appendix 8-C. The mitigation table from that publication is shown generally below. See referenced publication for wetlands with special characteristics:

 

	Category of Wetland Impacts	Reestablishment or Creation	Rehabilitation Only	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Rehabilitation (RH)	Reestablishment or Creation (R/C) and Enhancement (E)	Enhancement Only

	Category I	6:1	12:1	1:1 (R/C) and 10:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 20:1 (E)	24:1 

	Category II	3:1	6:1	1:1 (R/C) and 4:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 8:1 (E)	12:1 

	Category III	2:1	4:1	1:1 (R/C) and 2:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 4:1 (E)	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	1:1 (R/C) and 1:1 (RH)	1:1 (R/C) and 2:1 (E)	6:1

(c) Credit/Debit Method. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the table above, the city manager or designee may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised).

(d) Decreased Replacement Ratio. The city may decrease these ratios under the following circumstances:

(i) Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high likelihood of success;

(ii) Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the wetland being impacted; or

(iii) The proposed mitigation actions are conducted at least two years in advance of the impact and have been shown to be successful.

(4) On-site compensation is generally preferred over off-site compensation. Off-site compensation allows replacement of wetlands away from the site on which the wetland has been impacted by a regulated activity. When considering off-site mitigation, preference should be given to using alternative mitigation, such as a mitigation bank, in-lieu-fee program, or advance mitigation. The following conditions apply to off-site compensation:

(a) Off-site compensation shall occur within the same drainage basin of the same watershed where the wetland loss occurs; provided, that Category IV wetlands may be replaced outside of the watershed if there is no reasonable alternative. In such instances, the stormwater storage function provided by Category IV wetlands must be provided for within the design of the development project. 

(b) Off-site compensation can be allowed only under one or more of the following circumstances: 

(i) On-site compensation is not feasible due to hydrology, soils, or other factors; 

(ii) On-site compensation is not practical due to probable adverse impacts from surrounding land uses or would conflict with a federal, state or local public safety directive; 

(iii) Potential functions and value at the site of the proposed restoration are greater than the lost wetland functions and value; 

(iv) When the wetland to be altered is of a limited function and value and is degraded, compensation shall be of the wetland community types needed most in the location of compensation and those most likely to succeed with the highest functional value possible;

(v) Use of a wetland mitigation bank. Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the mitigation bank instrument. Use of credits from a wetland mitigation bank certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC is allowed if:

(A) The approval authority determines that it would provide appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts;

(B) The impact site is located in the service area of the bank;

(C) The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the certified mitigation bank instrument; and

(D) Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits is consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified mitigation bank instrument.

(5) Out-of-kind compensation (i.e., not of the same aquatic resource type) can be allowed when out-of-kind replacement will best meet the provisions of this section and the mitigation sequence outlined in NPMC 18.36.160. 

(6) Selecting Compensation Sites. 

(a) Except in the case of cooperative compensation projects in selecting compensation sites, applicants shall pursue locations in the following order of preference: 

(i) Filled, drained, or cleared sites which were formerly wetlands and where appropriate hydrology exists; 

(ii) Upland sites, adjacent to wetlands, if the upland is significantly disturbed and does not contain a mature forested or shrub community of native species, and where the appropriate natural hydrology exists. 

(b) Where out-of-kind replacement is accepted, greater restoration/creation ratios may be required. Out-of-kind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

(7) Timing. Construction of compensation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing wildlife and plants. Construction shall be timed to assure that grading and soil movement occurs during the dry season and planting of vegetation shall be specifically timed to needs of the target species. 

(8) Alternative Compensation Projects. The city may encourage, facilitate and approve innovative wetland mitigation projects. Advance compensation, mitigation banking, and in-lieu fee programs are examples of alternative compensation projects which may be allowed under the provisions of this section. The city manager or designee shall consider the following for approval of an alternative mitigation proposal:

(a) The proposal uses a watershed approach consistent with Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Ecology Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009).

(b) Creation or enhancement of a larger system of natural areas and open space is preferable to the preservation of many individual habitat areas.

(c) Mitigation according to subsection (2)(d) of this section is not feasible due to site constraints such as parcel size, stream type, wetland category, or geologic hazards.

(d) There is clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the proposed mitigation site.

(e) The plan shall contain clear and measurable standards for achieving compliance with the specific provisions of the plan. A monitoring plan shall, at a minimum, meet the provisions in NPMC 18.36.170(7).

(f) The plan shall be reviewed and approved as part of overall approval of the proposed use.

(g) A wetland of a different type may be justified based on regional needs or functions and values; the replacement ratios may not be reduced or eliminated unless the reduction results in a preferred environmental alternative.

(h) Mitigation guarantees shall meet the minimum requirements as outlined in NPMC 18.36.230.

(i) Qualified professionals in each of the critical areas addressed shall prepare the plan.

(j) The city may consult with agencies with expertise and jurisdiction over the critical areas during the review to assist with analysis and identification of appropriate performance measures that adequately safeguard critical areas.

(9) Wetlands Enhancement as Mitigation. Impacts to wetlands may be mitigated by enhancement of existing significantly degraded wetlands. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands must produce a critical areas report that identifies how enhancement will increase the functions of the degraded wetland and how this increase will adequately mitigate for the loss of wetland area and function at the impact site. An enhancement proposal must also show whether existing wetland functions will be reduced by the enhancement actions. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).

Article IV. Geologically Hazardous Areas 


18.36.510 Geologically hazardous areas designation.

Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development or clearing is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development or clearing may not only place itself at risk, but also may increase the hazard to surrounding development and use. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as a geologically hazardous area: 

(1) Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are areas with slopes greater than 15 percent with a vertical relief of at least 20 feet as well as areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “moderate to severe,” “severe,” or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard;

(2) Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of bedrock, soil type, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, other factors, or a combination thereof. 

Any area with a slope of 25 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 20 or more feet shall be designated as a landslide hazard area. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least 20 feet of vertical relief. Slopes over 25 percent with certain geological conditions can present a hazard to development on the site, neighboring property and to public safety and welfare. Some of these conditions are outlined below: 

(a) Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, or undercutting by wave action including marine bluffs and ravines; 

(b) Areas of historic failures, such as: 

(i) Those areas delineated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service as having a “severe” limitation for building site development; 

(ii) Those areas mapped by the Department of Ecology (Coastal Zone Atlas) or the Department of Natural Resources (slope stability mapping) as unstable (“U” or class 3), unstable old slides (“UOS” or class 4), or unstable recent slides (“URS” or class 5); or 

(iii) Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earthflows, mudflows, lahars, or landslides on maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey or Department of Natural Resources; 

(c) Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch; 

(d) Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; and 

(3) Special Geological Hazard Areas. Geologically hazardous areas shall also include areas determined by the city engineer to be susceptible to other geological events including but not limited to seismically induced mass wasting, debris flows, and differential settlement.

18.36.530 Performance standards.

(1) The following apply to all geologically hazardous areas:

(a) Alterations of Geologically Hazardous Areas. Alterations of geologically hazardous areas or associated buffers may only occur for activities that: 

(i) Will not increase the threat of the geological hazard to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions; 

(ii) Will not adversely impact other critical areas; 

(iii) Are designed so that the hazard to the project is eliminated or mitigated to a level equal to or less than predevelopment conditions; and 

(iv) Are certified as safe as designed and under anticipated conditions by a qualified professional, licensed in the state of Washington. 

(b) Critical Facilities Prohibited. Critical facilities shall not be sited within geologically hazardous areas unless there is no other practical alternative. 

(c) Vegetation Shall Be Retained. Unless otherwise provided or as part of an approved plan of alteration, removal of vegetation from an erosion or landslide hazard areas or related buffers shall be prohibited. All temporary disturbances associated with allowed impacts shall be restored to preconstruction conditions.

(d) Seasonal Restriction. Clearing shall be allowed in a landslide hazard area only from May 1st to October 1st of each year; provided, that the city may extend or shorten the dry season on a case-by-case basis depending on actual weather conditions, except that timber harvest, not including brush clearing or stump removal, may be allowed pursuant to an approved forest practice permit issued by the city or the Department of Natural Resources. Clearing in erosion hazard areas shall not be subject to this restriction if an erosion control plan prepared by the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city engineer that clearing can be accomplished without creating a geologic hazard or a significant impact on adjacent or downstream properties. 

(e) Utility Lines and Pipes. Utility lines and pipes shall be permitted in erosion and landslide hazard areas only when the applicant demonstrates that no other practical alternative is available. Cost is not to be considered in determining practical alternatives. The line or pipe shall be located above ground and properly anchored and/or designed so that it will continue to function in the event of an underlying slide. Stormwater conveyance shall be allowed only through a high-density polyethylene pipe with fuse-welded joints, or similar product that is technically equal or superior. 

(f) Point Discharges. Point discharges from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or upstream from an erosion or landslide hazard area shall be prohibited except as follows: 

(i) Conveyed via continuous storm pipe downslope to a point where there are no erosion hazard areas downstream from the discharge; 

(ii) Discharged at flow durations matching predevelopment conditions, with adequate energy dissipation, into existing channels that previously conveyed stormwater runoff in the predeveloped state; or 

(iii) Dispersed discharge upslope of the steep slope onto a low-gradient undisturbed buffer demonstrated to be adequate to infiltrate all surface and stormwater runoff, and where it can be demonstrated that such discharge will not increase the saturation of the slope. 

(2) Landslide Hazard Areas. Activities on sites containing landslide hazards shall meet the standards of subsection (1) of this section and the specific following requirements: 

(a) Prohibited Development. 

(i) Placement of structures, excavation, and earth fills on slopes greater than 60 percent is prohibited.

(iii) Installation of on-site sewage disposal systems, including drain fields, shall be prohibited within landslide hazard areas and related buffers;

(b) Buffer Required. A buffer shall be established from all edges of landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined by the city to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage, death or injury resulting from landslides caused in whole or part by the development, based upon review of and concurrence with a critical areas report prepared by a qualified professional. 

(i) Minimum Buffer. The minimum buffer shall be 50 feet. 

(ii) Buffer Reduction. The buffer may be eliminated for slopes under 40 percent and reduced to a minimum of 10 feet for all other slopes when a qualified professional demonstrates to the city’s satisfaction that the reduction will adequately protect the proposed development, adjacent properties and uses and the subject critical area. 

(iii) Increased Buffer. The buffer may be increased where the city determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed and existing development; 

(c) Alterations. Alterations of a landslide hazard area and/or buffer may only occur for activities for which a hazards analysis is submitted and certifies that:

(iii) Such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas; 

(d) Design and Analysis Standards. Development within a landslide hazard area and/or buffer shall be designed to meet the following basic requirements unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative design that deviates from one or more of these standards provides greater long-term slope stability while meeting all other provisions of this chapter. The requirement for long-term slope stability shall exclude designs that require regular and periodic maintenance to maintain their level of function. The basic development design standards are: 

(i) The proposed development shall not have a factor of safety for landslide occurrences below the limits of 1.5 for static conditions and 1.2 for dynamic conditions. Analysis of dynamic conditions shall be based on a minimum horizontal acceleration as established by the current version of the building code as specified in NPMC 14.10.060 and/or this chapter;

(ii) Structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologically hazardous areas and other critical areas; 

(iii) Structures and improvements shall minimize alterations to the natural contour of the slope and foundations shall be tiered to conform to existing topography; 

(iv) Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation; 

(v) The proposed development shall not result in greater risk or a need for increased buffers on neighboring properties;

All of the following habitat areas are designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas:

(1) State and Federally Designated Areas. Areas, habitats, and areas that contain habitat forming processes with which state or federally designated endangered, threatened, and sensitive species have a primary association. 

(2) State Priority Habitats and Areas Associated with State Priority Species. Priority habitats and species are considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority species require protective measures for their perpetuation due to their population status, sensitivity to habitat alteration, and/or recreational, commercial, or tribal importance. Priority habitats are those habitat types or elements with unique or significant value to a diverse assemblage of species. A priority habitat may consist of a unique vegetation type or dominant plant species, a described successional stage, or a specific structural element. Priority habitats and species are identified by the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. 

(3) Habitats and Species of Local Importance. Habitats and species of local importance that are deemed to need protection shall be designated by the city council pursuant to one or more of the following three standards: (a) population status, or (b) sensitivity to habitat manipulation, or (c) protection through possible retention or recovery of connectivity of habitat features. Designated habitats and species of local importance are subject to the provisions of this chapter. 

City residents may nominate habitats and species of local importance for city council consideration by using the following guidelines: 

(a) Demonstrate a need for special consideration based on: 

(i) Declining population;

(ii) Sensitivity to habitat manipulation; or 

(iii) Commercial or game value or other special value, such as public appeal; 

(b) Propose relevant management strategies considered effective and within the scope of this chapter; 

(c) Provide species habitat location(s) on a map (scale: one to 24,000). Submitted proposals will be reviewed by the city and forwarded to the Departments of Fish and Wildlife, Natural Resources and other local and state agencies or experts for comments and recommendations regarding accuracy of data and effectiveness of proposed management strategies. The city will hold a public hearing for nominations by city residents found to be complete, accurate, potentially effective and within the scope of this chapter. Nominations approved by the city council are designated “habitats or species of local importance” and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. 

A list of currently designated habitats and species of local importance shall be maintained at the community development office.

(4) Waters of the State. Waters of the state include lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters, and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington, as classified in WAC 222-16-030. 

(5) Puget Sound Nearshore. The nearshore generally extends from the top of shoreline bluffs to the depth offshore where light penetrating the sound’s water falls below a level supporting plant growth, and upstream in estuaries to the head of tidal influence. It includes bluffs, beaches, mudflats, kelp and eelgrass beds, salt marshes, gravel spits, and estuaries. 

(6) Commercial and Recreational Shellfish Areas. These areas include all public and private tidelands or bedlands suitable for shellfish harvest, including shellfish protection districts established pursuant to Chapter 90.72 RCW. 

(7) Herring and smelt spawning areas. 

(8) Salmon spawning, rearing, and habitat areas. 

(9) Coastal bluffs.

18.36.620 Water type classification. 

Water types shall be classified according to WAC 222-16-030. Water types are described generally below: 

Type S waters are all waters inventoried as “shorelines of the state” under Chapter 90.58 RCW. Shorelines of the state include the entire Puget Sound coastline within the city limits of Normandy Park. No streams within Normandy Park are classified as Type S waters. 

Type F waters are segments of natural waters, other than Type S waters, which contain fish habitat. Miller Creek, Walker Creek, Sequoia Creek and Normandy Creek are the only Type F waters identified in Normandy Park (Water Resource Inventory Area 9). 

Type Np waters include those which are perennial during a year of normal rainfall and do not have the potential to be used by fish and are typically formed by geomorphic process. 

Type Ns waters include those which are seasonal or ephemeral during a year of normal rainfall and do not have the potential to be used by fish and were generally formed by a geomorphic process. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.630 Additional critical areas report requirements. 

In addition to the general critical areas report requirements of NPMC 18.36.150, critical areas reports for habitat conservation areas must meet the requirements of this section. Critical areas reports for two or more types of critical areas must meet the report requirements for each relevant type of critical area. 

(1) Habitat Assessment. A habitat assessment is an investigation of the project area to evaluate the potential presence or absence of designated fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. A critical areas report for a habitat conservation area shall contain an assessment of habitats including the following site- and proposal-related information at a minimum: 

(a) Detailed description of habitat and habitat forming processes on and adjacent to the project area;

(b) Identification of any habitats and species of local importance, priority species, or endangered, threatened, sensitive or federal or state candidate species that have a primary association with habitat and habitat forming processes on or adjacent to the project area, and assessment of potential project impacts to the use of the site by the species;

(c) A discussion of any federal, state, or local special management recommendations, including Department of Fish and Wildlife habitat management recommendations, that have been developed for species or habitats located on or adjacent to the project area; 

(d) A detailed discussion of the direct and indirect potential impacts on habitat by the project, including potential impacts to water quality; 

(e) A discussion of measures, including avoidance, minimization and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing habitats and restore any habitat that was degraded prior to the current proposed land use activity and to be conducted in accordance with mitigation sequencing, NPMC 18.36.170; and 

(f) A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect habitat after the project site has been developed, including proposed monitoring and maintenance programs. 

(2) Additional Information May Be Required. When appropriate and deemed necessary due to the type of habitat or species present or the project area conditions, the city may also require the habitat management plan to include: 

(a) An evaluation by a qualified professional regarding the applicant’s analysis and the effectiveness of any proposed mitigating measures or programs, to include any recommendations as appropriate; 

(b) A request for consultation with the Department of Fish and Wildlife, or other appropriate agency; and 

(c) Detailed surface and subsurface hydrologic features both on and adjacent to the site. (Ord. 997 § 3 (Exh. B), 2019; Ord. 825 § 3 (Exh. A), 2009).


18.36.640 Performance standards.

(1) Alterations Prohibited. Land development and use shall be prohibited from habitat conservation areas and their buffers, except in accordance with this chapter. 

(2) Mitigation Shall Result in Contiguous Corridors. When mitigation is required to offset impacts, mitigation sites shall be located to preserve or achieve contiguous wildlife habitat corridors to minimize the isolating effects of development on habitat areas, so long as mitigation of aquatic habitat is located within the same aquatic ecosystem as the area disturbed. 

(3) Approvals of Activities May Be Conditioned. The city shall condition approvals of activities allowed within or adjacent to a habitat conservation area or its buffers, as necessary, to minimize or mitigate any potential adverse impacts. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(a) Any approval of alterations or impacts to a habitat conservation area shall be supported by the best available science;

(b) Establishment of buffer zones; 

(c) Preservation of critically important vegetation;

(g) Requirement of a performance security in accordance with NPMC 18.36.230, when necessary, to ensure completion and success of proposed mitigation. 

(4) Buffers.

(a) Establishment of Buffers. The city shall require the establishment of buffer areas for activities adjacent to riparian habitat conservation and marine buffer areas when needed to protect the habitat conservation areas. Required buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the habitat and the type and intensity of human activity proposed to be conducted nearby. 

(b) Habitat Conservation Areas Riparian and Marine Buffers. A habitat and conservation area buffer shall have the following widths, unless a lesser width is allowed pursuant to subsection (4)(d) of this section. Widths shall be measured outward in each direction, on the horizontal plane, from the ordinary high water mark or from the outer edge of the floodway, whichever is greater.

	Water Type	Riparian/Marine Buffer 

	S	115 feet (See SMP)

	F	115 feet

	Np	65 feet

	Ns	25 feet

(c) Increasing Buffer Widths. The city has the authority to increase the standard buffer widths when such buffers are necessary for one of the following: 

(i) To protect priority fish or wildlife using the habitat conservation areas. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation from the Departments of Ecology and Fish and Wildlife, showing that the increased buffer width is reasonably related to the protection of the fish and/or wildlife using the habitat conservation area. 

(ii) To provide connectivity when a Type S or F waterbody is located within 300 feet of: 

(A) Another Type S or F waterbody; 

(B) A fish and wildlife habitat conservation area; or 

(C) A Category I, II, or III wetland. 

The increased buffer distance may be limited to those areas that provide connectivity or are necessary to protect habitat functions. Increasing the buffer widths will only be done where necessary to preserve the structure, function and value of the habitat. 

(d) Buffer Averaging. Buffer width averaging may be allowed by the city if: 

(i) It will provide additional natural resource protection, as long as the total area contained in the buffer on the development proposal site does not decrease; 

(ii) The stream or shoreline contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils, or vegetation, and the stream would benefit from a wider buffer in places and would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places; and 

(iii) The buffer width is not reduced to less than 25 percent of the standard buffer.

(e) Buffer Reduction. Buffer reductions will only be considered as part of a permit application and must be supported by a critical areas report prepared by a qualified professional in accordance with NPMC 18.36.150. Buffers may be reduced when buffer reduction impacts are mitigated and result in no net loss of critical area function. Prior to considering buffer reductions, the applicant shall demonstrate application of mitigation sequencing as required in NPMC 18.36.160. A plan for mitigating buffer-reduction impacts must be prepared using selected incentive-based mitigation options from the list below, and is subject to approval by the city. All proposals for buffer reductions are subject to an independent, third party review on behalf of the city and at the applicant’s expense in accordance with NPMC 18.36.070. 

The following incentive options for reducing standard buffer widths shall be considered cumulative up to a maximum reduction of 50 percent of the standard buffer width. In all circumstances where a substantial portion of the remaining buffer is degraded, the buffer reduction plan shall include replanting with native vegetation in the degraded portions of the remaining buffer area and shall include a five-year monitoring and maintenance plan. 

(i) Installation of biofiltration/infiltration mechanisms: up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width for the installation of bioswales, created and/or enhanced wetlands, or ponds, all of which would be supplemental to existing storm drainage and water quality requirements.

(iii) Removal of invasive, nonnative vegetation: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width for the removal and extended (minimum five-year) monitoring and continued-removal maintenance of relatively dense stands of invasive, nonnative vegetation from significant portions of the remaining buffer area. 

(iv) In-stream habitat enhancement: 

(A) Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width for log structure placement, bioengineered bank stabilization, or culvert removal; or 

(B) Up to 30 percent reduction in standard buffer width for improving fish passage and/or creation of side channel or backwater areas. 

(v) If not already required under an existing development proposal, installation of oil/water separators for stormwater quality control: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width. 

(vi) Restoration of off-site area if no on-site area is preferable: 

(A) Up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width if restoration area is at a two-to-one ratio or greater; or 

(B) Up to 20 percent reduction in standard buffer width if restoration area is at a four-to-one ratio or greater. 

(vii) Removal of significant refuse or sources of toxic material: up to 10 percent reduction in standard buffer width. 

(viii) Up to 10 percent in standard buffer width for preparation and implementation of, and agreement to have recorded on the property title, a vegetation management plan that includes alternatives to the use of fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides as needed to protect water quality.

(ix) Up to 10 percent in standard buffer width for limiting lawn area to no greater than 20 percent of the lot area. Landscaped areas outside of the lawn and buffer areas shall be maintained or planted in noninvasive vegetation. 

(x) The city may also consider buffer reductions of up to 10 percent in standard buffer width for decreasing impacts to buffers using low impact development (LID) which includes practices such as rain gardens, permeable pavement, vegetated roofs, roof rainwater collection systems and other practices. 

(f) Buffer Elimination. Buffers may be eliminated on Type Ns streams which are currently piped or channelized in concrete. Wherever practical, Ns streams which are piped or have channels of concrete should be restored with rock and gravel bottoms and have vegetated banks. Buffer elimination will only be considered as part of a development permit application or restoration project, and must be supported by a critical areas report prepared by a qualified professional in accordance with NPMC 18.36.150. In order for buffer elimination to be approved for a project requiring a development permit, a site plan must be prepared using selected incentive-based mitigation options from the list below, and is subject to approval by the city. All proposals for buffer elimination are subject to an independent, third party review on behalf of the city and at the applicant’s expense in accordance with NPMC 18.36.070. The following incentive options for buffer elimination shall be included in the plan to the maximum extent possible for development related projects; restoration projects should include elements of subsections (4)(f)(iii) through (vi) of this section:

(i) Installation of Biofiltration/Infiltration Mechanisms. Installation of bioswales, rain gardens, created and/or enhanced wetlands, or ponds, all of which would be supplemental to existing storm drainage and water quality requirements. 

(ii) Removal of Existing Impervious Surfaces. Reduction in impervious surfaces within the standard buffer area to the extent practicable.

(5) Signs and Fencing of Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas. In accordance with NPMC 18.36.330:

(a) Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and inspected by the city manager or designee prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place. 

(b) Permanent Signs. As a condition of any development permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the city shall require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a fish and wildlife habitat conservation area or buffer. 

(i) Permanent signs shall be made of a metal face and attached to a metal post, or another material of equal durability. 

(ii) Signs must be posted at an interval of two per lot or every 100 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity.

18.40.010 Purpose.

This chapter has been enacted to authorize the city manager or his designee to waive or vary provisions, when necessary, of the Normandy Park Municipal Code to reasonably accommodate the statutory rights of the disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Fair Housing Act or the Fair Housing Act Amendment (FHA or FHAA), the Washington Housing Policy Act (WHPA), or the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD). This process shall be interpreted and administered in order to ensure the full exercise and enjoyment of a disabled person’s right to the residential housing of his or her choosing. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to commercial activities or zones; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be interpreted to limit the exercise of a disabled person’s rights by or through a residential care provider. In the event of any conflict or if an interpretation of this chapter is required, it shall be implemented and interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the ADA, the FHA, the FHAA, the WHPA, and the WLAD. (Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).


18.40.020 Reasonable accommodation.

(1) Upon the application of a disabled person or individual or entity providing services to the disabled in a residential facility or other group living arrangement (hereinafter “disabled person”), the city manager or his designee is hereby authorized to vary, modify, or waive the provisions of the Normandy Park Municipal Code, including but not limited to this title, parking and standing restrictions contained in NPMC Title 8, and pursuant to provisions of NPMC Title 14 relating to buildings and construction, in order to provide a reasonable accommodation as necessary to provide to a disabled person or the disabled person’s care provider the full enjoyment of a residence.

(2) The following review shall include an opportunity for citizen input into the administrative process. The city manager shall provide written notice of the accommodation to the applicant and property owners within 300 feet of the subject site. Operators of group homes are strongly encouraged to conduct voluntary informational meetings with the residents of the neighborhood in which they wish to locate prior to moving into a new location.

(3) When applying this reasonable accommodation process to the Normandy Park Municipal Code, including application of the state building code and other codes adopted pursuant to NPMC Title 14, the staff shall avoid the stereotypical assumptions regarding the disabled and shall attempt to ascertain the actual physical and/or mental limitation of the disabled individual by appropriate evidence in order to craft an accommodation which best suits the exercise of the individual’s rights. This process shall be interactive and include consultation with the disabled individual. The city shall make every effort to protect confidentiality regarding the nature and extent of an individual’s disability, to the extent permitted by state law. (Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).


18.40.030 Waiver of building codes and other uniform requirements.

No reasonable accommodation shall be provided by a waiver or variance to the provisions of the codes adopted pursuant to NPMC Title 14 which do not substantially accomplish the purposes of those chapters or which would reduce the fire, structural, electrical, plumbing or other life or health safety features of any structure. Modifications, waivers or variances of the provisions of the International Building Codes, International Fire Codes, and other codes adopted pursuant to NPMC 14.05.015 et seq. of the Normandy Park Municipal Code shall provide at least the same level of safety required by the respective codes. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing that the proposed modification, waiver or variance accomplishes substantially the same purpose without reduction of fire and other safety requirements. Nothing herein shall be required to require the waiver of a code provision or permit requirement which is generally applicable to all persons and does not have a differential, negative impact on the disabled, such as, for example, lot square footage requirements, provisions relating to impervious surfaces and utility charges and fees generally applicable to every resident. (Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).


18.40.040 Accommodations personal to the applicant.

The accommodation provided shall be personal to the applicant and shall not run with the land; provided, however, that a change in a residential structure necessary to accommodate the operation of a residential care provider to the disabled may be continued by future operations of similar facilities at the site which establish the same use within six months of the date the prior use by a disabled person or residential care provider ceases. The city manager may therefore direct that any physical change in the structure which would otherwise be illegal under the use or bulk requirements of the Community Development Code be brought into compliance six months after the date of sale, transfer or nonuse of a residential structure to a person or entity not qualifying for the provisions of the ADA, WLAD, FHA, FHAA, or WHPA. (Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).


18.40.050 Final decision – Findings – Notice.

The city manager or designee shall issue a written accommodation decision within 30 days of issuance of the notice provided in NPMC 18.40.020(2). This accommodation decision shall be a final decision, subject to the appeal provision in NPMC 18.40.060. A copy of the accommodation decision shall be provided to the applicant and property owners who comment following notice of the application under NPMC 18.40.020(3). The accommodation decision shall include findings and conclusions supporting the decision. (Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).


18.40.060 Revocation.

(1) The city manager or his designee may issue a written notice of violation to the disabled person in the event that reasonable cause exists to believe that any disabled person who has been granted a reasonable accommodation is:

(a) In violation of any condition of approval;

(b) That the property for which a reasonable accommodation has been granted is no longer in the ownership of the disabled person; and/or

(c) Violations of city policies, practices or ordinances have occurred which are beyond the scope of an approved reasonable accommodation.

(2) Notice shall be delivered to the disabled person by the U.S. mail, addressed to the individual at the property for which the reasonable accommodation has been approved (hereinafter “respondent”).

(3) The respondent may:

(a) Appeal the violation within 14 calendar days of deposit of the notice of violation in the U.S. mail by filing a written notice of appeal with the hearing examiner in accordance with NPMC 14.05.400; or

(b) Come into compliance within the compliance period set forth in the notice.

(4) Failure to respond, either by appeal within the period set forth or by compliance within the compliance period, shall void the granted reasonable accommodation.

(5) This hearing is an information process. In the event of a timely appeal, a hearing shall be set before the city’s hearing examiner in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18.150 NPMC. (Ord. 924 § 2(L), 2015; Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).


18.40.070 Appeal.

Except as provided in NPMC 18.40.060, there shall be no internal administrative appeal from the decision of the city manager. Interested persons – that is, persons located within 300 feet of the building site – may appeal the reasonable accommodation by filing a petition for review with the King County superior court in accordance with the provisions of the Land Use Petition Act (LUPA). (Ord. 899 § 1, 2013).

18.42.090 General requirements.

(1) Within public parks and public open spaces, the placement of antennas on existing structures, such as power poles, light poles for streets and parking lots, light standards for recreational fields and antenna support structures, is the preferred option subject to the approval of the property owner. If an existing structure cannot accommodate an antenna due to structural deficiency, or does not have the height required to provide adequate signal coverage, the structure may be replaced with a new structure, provided:

(a) The new structure will serve the original purpose.

(b) Does not exceed the original height by 40 feet or the maximum height allowed by this chapter. Any height increase in excess of 40 feet must be approved as an element of the conditional use permit.

(c) Meets all the requirements of this chapter.

(2) Concealed attached antennas shall comply with the following requirements:

(a) Concealed antennas shall reflect the visual characteristics of the structure to which they are attached and shall be designed to architecturally match the facade, roof, wall, or structure on which they are affixed so that they blend with the existing structural design, color, and texture. This shall include the use of colors and materials, as appropriate. When located on structures such as buildings or water towers, the placement of the antenna on the structure shall reflect the following order of priority in order to minimize visual impact:

(i) A location as close as possible to the center of the structure; and

(ii) Along the outer edges or side-mounted; provided, that, in this instance, additional means such as screens should be considered and may be required by the department on a case-by-case basis; and

(iii) When located on the outer edge or side-mounted, be placed on the portion of the structure less likely to be seen from adjacent lands containing, in descending order of priority: existing residences, public parks and open spaces, and public roadways.

(b) Notwithstanding the height limit of the underlying zone, the top of the concealed attached WCF shall not be more than 20 feet above the existing or proposed nonresidential building or structure, or more than 15 feet above a residential building or structure.

(c) Feed lines shall be contained within a principal building or encased, and the encasement painted to blend and match the design, color, and texture of the facade, roof, wall, or structure to which they are affixed.

(3) Concealed antenna support structures shall comply with the following requirements:

(a) Upon application for a conditional use permit or a building permit for a new concealed antenna support structure, whichever is required first, the applicant shall provide a map showing all existing antenna support structures or other suitable nonresidential structures located within one-quarter mile of the proposed structure with consideration given to engineering and structural requirements.

(b) No new antenna support structure shall be permitted if an existing structure suitable for attachment of an antenna or collocation is located within one-quarter mile, unless the applicant demonstrates that the existing structure is physically or technologically unfeasible or is not made available for sale or lease by the owner or is not made available at a market rate cost or would result in greater visual impact. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show that a suitable structure for mounting of antenna or collocation cannot be reasonably or economically used in accordance with these criteria. This separation requirement shall not apply to small wireless facilities.

(c) In residential districts, new concealed antenna support structures shall only be permitted on lots whose principal use is not single-family residential, including but not limited to: schools, churches, synagogues, fire stations, parks, and other public property.

(d) To the extent that there is no conflict with the color and lighting requirements of the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration for aircraft safety purposes, new antenna support structures shall be concealed as defined by this title and shall be configured and located in a manner to have the least visually obtrusive profile on the landscape and adjacent properties. New concealed antenna support structures shall be designed to complement or match adjacent structures and landscapes with specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale, color, and texture and designed to blend with existing surroundings to the extent feasible. This shall be achieved through the use of compatible colors and materials, and alternative site placement to allow the use of topography, existing vegetation or other structures to screen the proposed concealed antenna support structure from adjacent lands containing, in descending order of priority: existing residences, public parks and open spaces, and public roadways.

(e) At time of application, the applicant shall file a letter with the department, agreeing to allow collocation on the tower. The agreement shall commit the applicant to provide, either at a market rate cost or at another cost basis agreeable to the affected parties, the opportunity to collocate the antenna of other service providers on the applicant’s proposed tower to the extent that such collocation is technically and structurally feasible for the affected parties.

(b) Base stations that are not located underground shall not be visible from public views. New base stations and ancillary structures shall be designed to complement or match adjacent structures and landscapes with specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale, color, and texture and designed to blend with existing surroundings to the extent feasible. This shall be achieved through the use of compatible colors and building materials of existing buildings or structures on the property, and alternative site placement to allow the use of topography, existing vegetation or other structures to screen the base station and ancillary structures from pedestrian views. Where feasible, one building with multiple compartments shall be constructed to serve the total number of anticipated collocation tenants. If the applicant can demonstrate that one building is not feasible or practical due to site design or other constraints, then a master site plan shall be provided to demonstrate how all potential base stations and ancillary structures will be accommodated within the vicinity of the WCF.

(3) Height Standards. The height of the antenna support structure shall be measured from the natural undisturbed ground surface below the center of the base of the tower to the top of the tower or if higher to the top of the highest antenna or piece of equipment attached thereto. The height of any WCF shall not exceed the height provided in the table below.

	Zone Districts	Maximum Height of New Antenna Support Structures	Maximum Height of Consolidated Antenna Support Structures

(6) Lighting Standards. Except as specifically required by the FCC or FAA, WCFs shall not be illuminated, except lighting for security purposes that is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. Any lighting required by the FAA or FCC must be the minimum intensity and number of flashes per minute (i.e., the longest duration between flashes) allowable to minimize the potential attraction to migratory birds. Dual lighting standards (white blinking light in daylight and red blinking light at dusk and nighttime) are required and strobe light standards are prohibited unless required. The lights shall be oriented so as not to project directly onto surrounding residential property, and consistent with FAA and FCC requirements.

(7) Signage. Commercial messages shall not be displayed on any WCF. The only signage that is permitted upon an antenna support structure, base station, or fence shall be informational, and for the purpose of identifying the antenna support structure (such as ASR registration number), as well as the party responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility, its current address and telephone number, security or safety signs, and property manager signs (if applicable). If more than 220 voltage is necessary for the operation of the facility and is present in a ground grid or in the antenna support structure, signs located every 20 feet and attached to the fence or wall shall display in large, bold, high-contrast letters (minimum letter height of four inches) the following: HIGH VOLTAGE – DANGER.

(8) Sounds. Maximum permissible sound levels to intrude into the real property of another person from a wireless communication facility shall not exceed 45 dB(A). In the case of maintenance, construction, and emergencies these sound levels may be exceeded for short durations as required by the specific circumstance. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019; Ord. 980 § 3, 2018; Ord. 821 § 1, 2009).


18.42.110 Aesthetic, concealment and design standards for small wireless deployments.

Small wireless facility deployments whether permitted in the right-of way under Chapters 4.08 and 4.09 NPMC or permitted in accordance with this chapter shall conform to the following design standards:

(1) Small wireless facilities attached to existing or replacement nonwooden light poles and other nonwooden poles in the right-of-way or nonwooden poles outside of the right-of-way shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) Antennas and the associated equipment enclosures (including disconnect switches and other appurtenant devices) shall be fully concealed within the pole, unless such concealment is otherwise technically infeasible, or is incompatible with the pole design, then the antennas and associated equipment enclosures must be camouflaged to appear as an integral part of the pole or flush-mounted to the pole, meaning no more than six inches off of the pole, and must be the minimum size necessary for the intended purpose, not to exceed the volumetric dimensions of small wireless facilities. If the equipment enclosure is permitted on the exterior of the pole, the applicant is required to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole, provided that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(b) The furthest point of any antenna or equipment enclosure may not extend more than 20 inches from the face of the pole.

(c) All conduit, cables, wires and fiber must be routed internally in the light pole. Full concealment of all conduit, cables, wires and fiber is required within mounting brackets, shrouds, canisters or sleeves if attaching to exterior antennas or equipment.

(d) An antenna on top of an existing pole may not extend more than six feet above the height of the existing pole and the diameter may not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, unless the applicant can demonstrate that more space is needed. The antennas shall be integrated into the pole design so that it appears as a continuation of the original pole, including colored or painted to match the pole, and shall be shrouded or screened to blend with the pole except for canister antennas which shall not require screening. All cabling and mounting hardware/brackets from the bottom of the antenna to the top of the pole shall be fully concealed and integrated with the pole.

(e) Any replacement pole shall substantially conform to the design of the pole it is replacing or the neighboring pole design standards utilized within the contiguous right-of-way.

(f) The height of any replacement pole may not extend more than 10 feet above the height of the existing pole or the minimum additional height necessary; provided, that the height of the replacement pole cannot be extended further by additional antenna height.

(g) The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the city’s setback and sidewalk clearance requirements and shall, to the extent technically feasible, not be more than a 25 percent increase of the existing nonwooden pole measured at the base of the pole, unless additional diameter is needed in order to conceal equipment within the base of the pole, and shall comply with the requirements in subsection (5)(d) of this section.

(h) The use of the pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(2) Wooden Pole Design Standards. Small wireless facilities located on wooden poles shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) The wooden pole at the proposed location may be replaced with a taller pole for the purpose of accommodating a small wireless facility; provided, that the replacement pole shall not exceed a height that is a maximum of 10 feet taller than the existing pole, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height extension is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities.

(b) A pole extender may be used instead of replacing an existing pole but may not increase the height of the existing pole by more than 10 feet, unless a further height increase is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner and that such height increase is the minimum extension possible to provide sufficient separation and/or clearance from electrical and wireline facilities. A “pole extender” as used herein is an object affixed between the pole and the antenna for the purpose of increasing the height of the antenna above the pole. The pole extender shall be painted to approximately match the color of the pole and shall substantially match the diameter of the pole measured at the top of the pole.

(c) Replacement wooden poles must either match the approximate color and materials of the replaced pole or shall be the standard new wooden pole used by the pole owner in the city.

(d) Antennas, equipment enclosures, and all ancillary equipment, boxes and conduit shall be colored or painted to match the approximate color of the surface of the wooden pole on which they are attached.

(e) Antennas shall not be mounted more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole.

(f) Antennas should be placed in an effort to minimize visual clutter and obtrusiveness. Multiple antennas are permitted on a wooden pole; provided, that each antenna enclosure shall not be more than three cubic feet in volume.

(g) A canister antenna may be mounted on top of an existing wooden pole, which may not exceed the height requirements described in subsection (2)(a) of this section. A canister antenna mounted on the top of a wooden pole shall not exceed 16 inches, measured at the top of the pole, and shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The canister antenna must be placed to look as if it is an extension of the pole. In the alternative, the applicant may propose a side-mounted canister antenna, so long as the inside edge of the antenna is no more than 12 inches from the surface of the wooden pole. All cables shall be concealed either within the canister antenna or within a sleeve between the antenna and the wooden pole.

(h) The furthest point of any antenna or equipment enclosure may not extend more than 20 inches from the face of the pole.

(i) An omni-directional antenna may be mounted on the top of an existing wooden pole, provided such antenna is no more than four feet in height and is mounted directly on the top of a pole or attached to a sleeve made to look like the exterior of the pole as close to the top of the pole as technically feasible. All cables shall be concealed within the sleeve between the bottom of the antenna and the mounting bracket.

(j) All related equipment, including but not limited to ancillary equipment, radios, cables, associated shrouding, microwaves, and conduit which are mounted on wooden poles shall not be mounted more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is technically required, and is confirmed in writing by the pole owner.

(k) Equipment for small wireless facilities must be attached to the wooden pole, unless otherwise permitted to be ground-mounted pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section. The equipment must be placed in the smallest enclosure possible for the intended purpose. The equipment enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the utility pole, including wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the pole, may not exceed 28 cubic feet. Multiple equipment enclosures may be acceptable if designed to more closely integrate with the pole design and do not cumulatively exceed 28 cubic feet. The applicant is encouraged to place the equipment enclosure behind any banners or road signs that may be on the pole; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(l) An applicant who desires to enclose both its antennas and equipment within one unified enclosure may do so; provided, that such enclosure is the minimum size necessary for its intended purpose and the enclosure and all other wireless equipment associated with the pole, including wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the pole does not exceed 28 cubic feet. The unified enclosure may not be placed more than six inches from the surface of the pole, unless a further distance is required and confirmed in writing by the pole owner. To the extent possible, the unified enclosure shall be placed so as to appear as an integrated part of the pole or behind banners or signs; provided, that such location does not interfere with the operation of the banners or signs.

(m) The visual effect of the small wireless facility on all other aspects of the appearance of the wooden pole shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible.

(n) The use of the wooden pole for the siting of a small wireless facility shall be considered secondary to the primary function of the pole. If the primary function of a pole serving as the host site for a small wireless facility becomes unnecessary, the pole shall not be retained for the sole purpose of accommodating the small wireless facility and the small wireless facility and all associated equipment shall be removed.

(o) The diameter of a replacement pole shall comply with the city’s setback and sidewalk clearance requirements and shall not be more than a 25 percent increase of the existing utility pole measured at the base of the pole.

(p) All cables and wires shall be routed through conduit along the outside of the pole. The outside conduit shall be colored or painted to match the pole. The number of conduits shall be minimized to the number technically necessary to accommodate the small wireless facility.

(3) Small wireless facilities attached to existing buildings shall conform to the following design criteria:

(a) Small wireless facilities may be mounted to the sides of a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building’s architectural theme.

(b) The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is discouraged.

(c) New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the architecture of the existing building.

(d) Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building.

(e) Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed cabling/wiring is prohibited.

(f) Small wireless facilities shall be painted and textured to match the adjacent building surfaces.

(4) Small wireless facilities mounted on cables strung between existing utility poles shall conform to the following standards:

(a) Each strand-mounted facility shall not exceed three cubic feet in volume;

(b) Only one strand-mounted facility is permitted per cable between any two existing poles;

(c) The strand-mounted devices shall be placed as close as possible to the nearest utility pole, in no event more than five feet from the pole unless a greater distance is technically necessary or is required by the pole owner for safety clearance;

(d) No strand-mounted device shall be located in or above the portion of the roadway open to vehicular traffic;

(e) Ground-mounted equipment to accommodate a shared mounted facility is not permitted except when placed in preexisting equipment cabinets;

(f) Pole-mounted equipment shall comply with the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section;

(g) Such strand-mounted devices must be installed to cause the least visual impact and without excess exterior cabling or wires (other than the original strand); and

(h) Strand-mounted facilities are prohibited on nonwooden poles.

(5) General Requirements.

(a) Ground-mounted equipment in the rights-of-way is prohibited, unless such facilities are placed underground or the applicant can demonstrate that pole-mounted or undergrounded equipment is technically infeasible. If ground-mounted equipment is necessary, then the applicant shall submit a concealment element plan. Generators located in the rights-of-way are prohibited.

(b) No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise in violation of Chapter 7.94 NPMC.

(c) Small wireless facilities are not permitted on traffic signal poles unless denial of the siting could be a prohibition or effective prohibition of the applicant’s ability to provide telecommunications service in violation of 47 U.S.C. 253 and 332.

(d) Replacement poles and new poles shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), city construction and sidewalk clearance standards, city ordinances, and state and federal laws and regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the rights-of-way. Further, the location of any replacement or new pole must: be physically possible, comply with applicable traffic warrants, not interfere with utility or safety fixtures (e.g., fire hydrants, traffic control devices), and not adversely affect the public welfare, health or safety.

(e) Replacement poles shall be located as near as possible to the existing pole with the requirement to remove the abandoned pole.

(f) No signage, message or identification other than the manufacturer’s identification or identification required by governing law is allowed to be portrayed on any antenna or equipment enclosure. Any permitted signage shall be located on the equipment enclosures and be of the minimum amount possible to achieve the intended purpose (no larger than four by six inches); provided, that signs are permitted as concealment element techniques where appropriate.

(g) Antennas and related equipment shall not be illuminated except for security reasons, required by a federal or state authority, or unless approved as part of a concealment element plan.

(h) Side arm mounts for antennas or equipment must be the minimum extension necessary and for wooden poles may be no more than 12 inches off the pole and for nonwooden poles no more than six inches off the pole.

(i) The preferred location of a small wireless facility on a pole is the location with the least visible impact.

(j) Antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary equipment, conduit and cable shall not dominate the structure or pole upon which they are attached.

(k) Except for locations in the right-of-way, small wireless facilities are not permitted on any property containing a residential use in the residential zones.

(l) The city may consider the cumulative visual effects of small wireless facilities mounted on poles within the rights-of-way when assessing proposed siting locations so as to not adversely affect the visual character of the city. This provision shall not be applied to limit the number of permits issued when no alternative sites are reasonably available nor to impose a technological requirement on the applicant.

(m) These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape.

(6) New Poles in the Rights-of-Way for Small Wireless Facilities and Installations in a Design District.

(a) New poles within the rights-of-way are only permitted if the applicant can establish that:

(i) The proposed small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing utility pole or light pole, electrical transmission tower or on a site outside of the public rights-of-way such as a public park, public property, building, transmission tower or in or on a nonresidential use in a residential zone whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure;

(ii) The proposed small wireless facility receives approval for a concealment element design, as described in subsection (6)(c) of this section;

(iii) The proposed small wireless facility also complies with Shoreline, Growth Management Act, and SEPA, if applicable; and

(iv) No new poles shall be located in a critical area or associated buffer required by the city’s critical areas management ordinance, except when determined to be exempt pursuant to said ordinance.

(b) An application for a new pole is subject to a Type I review.

(c) The concealment element design shall include the design of the screening, fencing or other concealment technology for a tower, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless facility, including but not limited to fiber and power connections.

(d) The concealment element design should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of the small wireless facility. The proposed pole or structure should have similar designs to existing neighboring poles in the rights-of-way, including similar height to the extent technically feasible. If the proposed small wireless facility is placed on a replacement pole in a design district, then the replacement pole shall be of the same general design as the pole it is replacing, unless the development services department otherwise approves a variation due to aesthetic or safety concerns. Any concealment element design for a small wireless facility on a decorative pole should attempt to mimic the design of such pole and integrate the small wireless facility into the design of the decorative pole. Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color, and texture – or the appearance thereof – as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to utilize designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure. Further, applicant designs should, to the extent technically possible, comply with the generally applicable design standards adopted pursuant to this section.

(i) If the director has already approved a concealment element design either for the applicant or another small wireless facility along the same public right-of-way or for the same pole type, then the applicant shall utilize a substantially similar concealment element design, unless it can show that such concealment element design is not physically or technologically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards.

(e) Even if an alternative location is established pursuant to subsections (1)(a) and (b) of this section the director may determine that a new pole in the right-of-way is in fact a superior alternative based on the impact to the city, the concealment element design, the city’s comprehensive plan and the added benefits to the community.

(f) Prior to the issuance of a permit to construct a new pole or ground-mounted equipment in the right-of-way, the applicant must obtain a site-specific agreement from the city to locate such new pole or ground-mounted equipment. This requirement also applies to replacement poles that are higher than the replaced pole, and the overall height of the replacement pole and the proposed small wireless facility is more than 60 feet.

(g) These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections of the streetscape. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019; Ord. 980 § 3, 2018).


18.42.120 Application process.

(1) Overview. In order to manage its rights-of-way in a thoughtful manner which balances the need to accommodate new and evolving technologies with the preservation of the natural and aesthetic environment of the city, the city of Normandy Park has adopted this administrative process for the deployment of small wireless facilities. The city and applicant for a franchise and other permits associated with the deployment of small wireless facilities face challenges in coordinating applicable legislative and administrative processes under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. A franchise for the use of the city’s right-of-way is a contract which requires approval by the city council. The small wireless permits are issued by the director. Applicants are encouraged and expected to provide all related applications in one submittal unless they have already obtained a franchise.

(2) Application Process. The director is authorized to establish franchise and other application forms to gather the information required by these ordinances from applicants and to determine the completeness of the application process as provided herein. The application shall include Parts A, B, and C as described below.

(a) Franchise. The process typically begins with and depends upon approval of a franchise for the use of the public right-of-way to deploy small wireless facilities if any portion of the applicant’s facilities is to be located in the right-of-way. A complete application for a franchise is designated as Part A. An applicant with a franchise for the deployment of small wireless facilities in the city may proceed to directly apply for a small wireless facility permit and related approvals (Parts B and C). An applicant at its option may utilize phased development. Because franchises are required by federal law to be competitively neutral, the city has established a franchise format for use by all right-of-way users.

(b) Small Wireless Facility Permits. Part B of the application requires specification of the small wireless facility components and locations as further required in the small wireless permit application described in Chapter 4.08 NPMC.

(c) Associated Permit(s). Part C of the application shall attach all associated permit requirements such as applications or checklists required under the critical areas, shoreline or SEPA ordinances. Applicants for deployment of small wireless facilities in the city design district or for new poles shall comply with the requirements in NPMC 18.42.110.

(d) Leases. An applicant who desires to attach a small wireless facility to any utility pole or light owned by the city shall include an application for a lease as a component of its application. The director is authorized to approve leases in the form approved for general use by the city council for any utility pole or light pole in the right-of-way. Leases for the use of other public property, structures or facilities shall be submitted to the city council for approval. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019).


18.42.130 Small wireless permit application.

The following information shall be provided by all applicants for a small wireless permit:

(1) The application shall provide specific locational information including GIS coordinates of all proposed small wireless facilities and specify where the small wireless facilities will utilize existing, replacement or new poles, towers, existing buildings and/or other structures.

(12) The small wireless facilities permit shall include those elements that are typically contained in the right-of-way use permit to allow the applicant to proceed with the build-out of the small wireless facility deployment.

(13) Recognizing that small wireless facility technology is rapidly evolving, the director is authorized to adopt and publish standards for the technological and structural safety of city-owned structures and to formulate and publish application questions for use when an applicant seeks to attach to city-owned structures. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019).


18.42.140 Review process.

(1) Review. The following provisions relate to review of applications for a small wireless facility permit:

(a) In any zone, upon application for a small wireless permit, the city will permit small wireless deployment on existing or replacement utility poles conforming to the city’s generally applicable development and design standard adopted pursuant to NPMC 18.42.110, except as provided in subsection (2) of this section.

(b) Vertical clearance shall be reviewed by the director to ensure that the small wireless facilities will not pose a hazard to other users of the rights-of-way.

(c) Small wireless facilities may not encroach onto or over private property or property outside of the right-of-way without the property owner’s express written consent.

(2) Development Services Department. Small wireless deployment in the Manhattan Village subarea design district, as well as new non-city-owned poles, or replacement poles deviating from the pole design standards adopted pursuant to NPMC 18.42.110, are subject to additional review pursuant to that section.

(3) Eligible Facilities Requests. The design approved in a small wireless facility permit shall be considered concealment elements and such facilities may only be expanded upon an eligible facilities request described in Chapter 4.10 NPMC when the modification does not defeat the concealment elements of the small wireless facility.

(4) Review of Facilities. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant shall be governed by the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 253 and 332 and other applicable statutes, regulations and case law. Applicants for franchises and the small wireless facility permits shall be treated in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner with other service providers, utilizing supporting infrastructure which is functionally equivalent, that is, service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement, or cumulative impacts. Small wireless facility permit review under this chapter shall neither prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services.

(5) Final Decision. Any decision by the director shall be final and not be subject to administrative appeals.

(6) Public Comment. The city shall provide notice of a complete application for a small wireless facility permit on the city’s website with a link to the application. The notice shall include an email contact and telephone number for the applicant to answer citizen inquiries. This notice is for the public’s information and is neither a hearing nor a part of any land use appeal process.

(7) Withdrawal. Any applicant may withdraw an application submitted pursuant to this chapter at any time, provided the withdrawal is in writing and signed by all persons who signed the original application or their successors in interest. When a withdrawal is received, the application shall be deemed null and void. If such withdrawal occurs prior to the director’s decision, then reimbursement of fees submitted in association with said application shall be prorated to withhold the amount of city costs incurred in processing the application prior to time of withdrawal. If such withdrawal is not accomplished prior to the director’s decision, there shall be no refund of all or any portion of such fee.

(8) Supplemental Information. Failure of an applicant to provide additional information as requested by the director as provided herein within 60 days of notice by the director shall be deemed a denial of that application unless an extension period has been approved by the director. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019).


18.42.150 Permit requirements.

(1) The grantee of any permit shall comply with all of the requirements within the small wireless permit.

(2) Small wireless to be facilities installed pursuant to a small wireless facility permit may proceed to install the approved small wireless facilities without the need for an additional right-of-way use permit if construction is commenced within 30 days of approval by providing email or written notice to the director. Facilities approved in a small wireless permit in which installation has not commenced within 30 days of the approval of a small wireless facility permit shall apply for and be issued a right-of-way use permit to install such small wireless facilities in accordance with the standard requirements of the city for use of the right-of-way.

(3) Post-Construction As-Builts. Within 30 days after construction of the small wireless facility, the grantee shall provide the city with as-builts of the small wireless facilities demonstrating compliance with the permit and site photographs.

(4) Permit Time Limit. Construction of the small wireless facility must be completed within six months after the approval date by the city. The grantee may request one extension to be limited to three months, if the applicant cannot construct the small wireless facility within the original six-month period.

(5) Site Safety and Maintenance. The grantee must maintain the small wireless facilities in safe and working condition. The grantee shall be responsible for the removal of any graffiti or other vandalism and shall keep the site neat and orderly, including but not limited to following any maintenance or modifications on the site. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019).


18.42.160 Modifications to small wireless facilities.

(1) If a grantee desires to make a modification to an existing small wireless facility, including but not limited to expanding or changing the antenna type, increasing the equipment enclosure, placing additional pole-mounted or ground-mounted equipment, or modifying the concealment elements, then the applicant shall apply for a small wireless facility permit.

(2) A small wireless facility permit shall not be required for routine maintenance and repair of a small wireless facility within the rights-of-way, or the replacement of an antenna or equipment of similar size, weight, and height; provided, that such replacement does not defeat the concealment elements used in the original deployment of the small wireless facility, does not impact the structural integrity of the pole, and does not require pole replacement. Further, a small wireless facility permit shall not be required for replacing equipment within the equipment enclosure or reconfiguration of fiber or power to the small wireless facility. Right-of-way use permits may be required for such routine maintenance, repair or replacement consistent with Chapter 10.48 NPMC. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019).


18.42.170 Consolidated permit.

(1) The issuance of a small wireless permit grants authority to construct small wireless facilities in the rights-of-way in a consolidated manner to allow the applicant, in most situations, to avoid the need to seek duplicative approval by both the public works and the development services department. If the applicant requires a new franchise to utilize the right-of-way, the franchise approval may be consolidated with the small wireless facility permit review if requested by the applicant. As an exercise of police powers pursuant to RCW 35.99.040(2), the small wireless facility permit is not a right-of-way use permit, but instead a consolidated public works and land use permit and the issuance of a small wireless facility permit shall be governed by the time limits established by federal law for small wireless facilities.

(2) The general standards applicable to the use of the rights-of-way described in Chapter 10.48 NPMC shall apply to all small wireless facility permits. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019).


18.42.180 Technical evaluation.

The city may retain the services of an independent technical expert such as a registered professional electrical engineer accredited by the state of Washington who holds a Federal Communications general radio telephone operator license. The engineer will provide technical evaluation of permit applications for WCFs. The applicant shall pay all the costs of said review. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019; Ord. 980 § 3, 2018; Ord. 821 § 1, 2009. Formerly 18.42.120).


18.42.190 Interference.

Whenever the city has encountered radio frequency interference with its public safety communications equipment, and it believes that such interference has been or is being caused by one or more WCFs, the following steps shall be taken:

(1) Upon notification by the city to WCF service providers potentially interfering with public safety communications equipment, the providers shall cooperate and coordinate among themselves the investigation and mitigation of the interference, if any, utilizing the procedures set forth in the joint wireless industry-public safety “Best Practices Guide,” released by the FCC in February 2001, including the “Good Engineering Practices,” as may be amended or revised by the FCC from time to time.

(2) If any WCF owner fails to cooperate with the city in complying with the owner’s obligations under this section or if the FCC makes a determination of radio frequency interference with the city public safety communications equipment, the owner who fails to cooperate and/or the owner of the WCF which caused the interference shall be responsible, upon FCC determination of radio frequency interference, for reimbursing the city for all costs associated with ascertaining and resolving the interference, including but not limited to any engineering studies obtained by the jurisdiction to determine the source of the interference. For the purposes of this subsection, failure to cooperate shall include failure to initiate any response or action as described in the “Best Practices Guide” within 24 hours of the city’s notification. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019; Ord. 980 § 3, 2018; Ord. 821 § 1, 2009. Formerly 18.42.130).


18.42.200 Cessation of use.

(1) Antenna shall be removed, at the owner’s expense, from WCFs within 180 days after the antenna is no longer operational, unless the abandonment is associated with a consolidation, in which case the removal shall occur within 90 days of cessation of use.

(2) The whole WCF shall be removed, at the owner’s expense, within 180 days of the date the last antenna is removed.

(3) An owner wishing to extend the time for removal or reactivation shall submit a written request along with the appropriate documentation demonstrating the reason for such extension request. The city may extend the time for removal up to 90 additional days upon a showing of good cause with one additional 90-day extension. If the antenna support structure or antenna is not removed in a timely fashion, the city may give notice that it will contract for removal within 30 days following written notice to the owner. Thereafter, the city may cause removal of the antenna support structure with costs being borne by the current WCF owner or landowner.

(4) Upon removal of the WCF, base station, and ancillary structures, said area shall be returned to its natural state and topography and vegetated consistent with the natural surroundings or consistent with the current use of the land at the time of removal. The cost of rehabilitation shall be borne by the current WCF owner or landowner. (Ord. 979 § 2, 2019; Ord. 980 § 3, 2018; Ord. 821 § 1, 2009. Formerly 18.42.140).

(a) Neighborhood centers, mixed use, industrial, or multifamily residential construction;

(b) Subdivisions;

(c) Permits for access to First Avenue South, whether or not the development is located within or outside the city; 

(d) Utilities; and

(e) Remodeling or additions to existing neighborhood centers, mixed use, industrial or multifamily residential buildings and all conversions to these uses, where the remodeling, addition, or conversion increases gross floor area by 20 percent or more, or where remodeling, addition, or repair exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the previously existing structure as of the date of the application.

(2) Whenever any development described in subsection (1) of this section is proposed to have access to any street in the city of Normandy Park that does not meet current city standards or that is proposed for improvement under the city’s comprehensive plan, it shall be a condition of approval for such development that off-site street improvements, including paving, curbs, sidewalks, storm drainage, street lights, and underground utilities conforming to city standards, shall be installed by the applicant prior to final approval or occupancy of the development. This requirement shall not be satisfied by providing a bond or other financial security in lieu of construction.

(3) Street improvements at a minimum shall include half the street abutting the property, but may extend to full-street improvements where necessary to ensure safe movement of vehicles, bicyclists, or pedestrians. Additional construction may also be required beyond the property frontage to the minimum extent to ensure safe movement of vehicles, bicyclists, or pedestrians and to connect with nearby improvements. These may include, but are not limited to, the construction of asphalt tapers, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, drainage improvements, driveway aprons, and signs and markings. To the extent possible, improvements should be designed to fit within existing rights-of-way and easements; provided, that safety is not compromised. The applicant shall be eligible to apply for a street reimbursement or latecomer’s agreement in order to be reimbursed by later developers for any permanent improvements beyond the normal half-street frontage.

(4) The city manager or his designee may allow an exception to the street frontage requirements of this section if the applicant demonstrates to the city manager that any of the following conditions are present:

(a) The impacts of the development do not contribute to the need for the required improvements or dedication; or

(b) The required improvement or dedication is not roughly proportional to the impact from the development. The applicant shall be required to show that the required improvement or dedication is not related either in nature or extent to the impact of the development; or

(c) If constructed, the use or operation of the improvements would decrease traffic safety; or

(d) The street is planned to be improved as a whole through a capital improvement project programmed by the city, county or state. If an exception is made for a development under this subsection (4)(d), the city manager or designee may still require the applicant to furnish an interim street plan to bring the roadway up to the existing character of surrounding streets and pedestrian facilities. This plan may include, but is not limited to, widening or installation of the asphalt street surface, sidewalks, gravel shoulders, temporary drainage facilities, walkways, and bikeways. An interim street plan may also include the payment of fees in lieu of construction, a covenant consenting to formation of a local improvement district, or the recording of a concomitant agreement requiring the future construction or funding of the street frontage improvements by the applicant.

(5) The decision of the city manager or designee on any request for an exception from the frontage requirements of this section may be appealed in the same manner as provided in this code for the underlying development permit. In the event that no procedure for appealing the underlying permit is provided in this code, the decision may be appealed by any aggrieved party to the city hearing examiner by filing a written notice of appeal and the required appeal fee with the city clerk within 30 calendar days from the date the decision of the city manager or designee is issued in writing. The notice of appeal shall provide a concise statement of the alleged errors in the decision of the city manager or designee and specify the relief requested. The hearing examiner shall hold an open record hearing on the appeal and may uphold the decision of the city manager or designee, uphold the same with conditions, or overturn the same. The hearing examiner shall determine whether the exception should be granted based on the criteria set forth above for the decision of the city manager or designee. The hearing examiner’s consideration of the exception shall be de novo based on the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing, but the hearing examiner shall give the decision of the city manager or designee substantial weight. The hearing examiner shall adopt findings and conclusions in support of the hearing examiner’s decision on the appeal. The hearing examiner’s decision shall be the final decision of the city and may be appealed to the King County superior court as provided in the Land Use Petition Act, Chapter 36.70C RCW.

(6) Protection of Vegetation. Trees or other types of natural vegetation that have aesthetic, functional, historical, cultural or other similar significance to the character of the city of Normandy Park shall be taken into consideration during the design process and protected to the extent possible when frontage improvements are required.

(7) Interpretation.

(a) In the case of a question as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use in a particular use category, the city manager or designee shall have the authority to make the final determination based on the characteristics of the operation of the proposed use and the city manager’s or his designee’s interpretation of the Standard Land Use Coding Manual and the Standard Industrial Classification Manual.

(b) In the case of a conflict between this section and the city’s adopted road standards, this section shall prevail. (Ord. 846 §§ 1 – 3, 2009).

A cottage housing development is allowed in all single-family residential zones of the city within 300 feet of First Avenue South between 178th Street Southwest and 200th Street Southwest and all mixed use zones; the map is shown in Attachment A to the ordinance codified in this chapter. All parent parcels shall be served by a public right-of-way. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 785 § 6, 2006).


18.52.070 Cottage housing development size.

Cottage housing developments shall contain a minimum of four and a maximum of 12 cottages located in a cluster or clusters to encourage a sense of community among the residents. (Ord. 785 § 7, 2006).


18.52.080 Special site requirements for cottage housing developments.

(1) Density, Lot Coverage, Height, Setback and Parking Requirements.

(a) Intent. The site requirements chart establishes the basic dimensional requirements for cottages. Development standards are intended to define design parameters of cottages to achieve compatibility with adjacent single-family residential uses. 

(b) Requirements – Cottage Housing Developments Site Requirements Chart. 

	 	Site Requirement

	Cottages Allowed in Place of Each Standard Single-Family Home Allowed by the Density of the Zone1	2

	Minimum Lot Frontage (in feet)	40 feet

	Setbacks for All Structures from Adjacent Property Lines Along the Perimeter of the Site (except front or any public street setback) 2, 3	10 feet

	Front or Any Public Street Setback4	20 feet

	Minimum Distance Between Structures (including accessory structures)	10 feet

	Maximum Lot Coverage for Structures	40 percent

	Maximum Impervious Surface Area	60 percent

	Minimum Common Open Space	400 square feet per cottage

	Maximum Height for One-Story Cottages and Accessory Structures	18 feet

	Maximum Height for 1-1/2-story Cottages5	21 feet

	Parking Spaces per Cottage6	1.5 (less than 2 BR)

2.0 (2 BR or more) 

Footnotes:

1.    For the purpose of this calculation, fractional values shall be rounded to the nearest whole number (0.5 and above, round up; below 0.5, round down). In no case shall the number of cottages allowed in place of each standard sized house (as permitted by Normandy Park zoning code) exceed two.

2.    When vehicular access to a cottage housing development is from an alley or access corridor, a five-foot minimum rear setback is allowed if it meets height requirements as outlined in NPMC 18.32.100(7)(b).

3.    Except eaves up to 18 inches. 

4.    Front orientation for purposes of lot setback requirements shall be the side or sides that address a public street or access corridor.

5.    Except gable end walls, all parts of the structure above 12 feet, as defined in the height limitation below, shall be roofs pitched no less than 4:12 and no greater than 16:12, except shed roofs on dormers, which may be pitched at a minimum of 2:12. The maximum height of any portion of the roof, except chimneys or cupolas, shall not exceed 20 feet above finished first floor level. Height limitation: For the purposes of this chapter, the limitation is 18 feet for single story units and 21 feet for one-and-one-half-story units, as measured from the lowest point of finished grade at the perimeter of the finished structure. Landscaping structures (i.e., retaining walls, raised planting beds, steep slopes) which would effectively increase the total apparent height beyond the height limit are not permitted within 10 feet of any cottage.

6.    The planning commission may reduce parking requirements based on the applicant’s demonstration of site-specific factors that justify a lower standard, such as opportunities for transit service or anticipated number of residents.

(2) Cottage Floor Area.

(a) Intent.

(i) Scale of Development. To ensure that the overall size, including bulk and mass of cottage structures and cottage housing developments, remains smaller and incur less visual impact than standard sized single-family dwellings, particularly given the allowed intensity of cottage dwellings.

(ii) Variety. To provide variety in cottage housing structures through a mixture of building sizes and building footprints.

(b) Requirements.

(i) The total floor area of each cottage shall not exceed either 1.5 times the area of the main floor or 1,050 square feet, whichever is less. Attached garages or carports shall be included in the calculation of total floor area.

(ii) For the purposes of this calculation, floor area shall be measured to the exterior walls.

(iii) Cottage areas that do not count toward the total floor area calculation are: 

(A) Unheated storage spaces six feet or less in height located under the main floor of the cottage.

(B) Architectural projections, such as bay windows, fireplaces or utility closets not greater than 18 inches in depth or six feet in width.

(C) Attached roofed porches.

(D) Detached garages or carports.

(E) Spaces with a ceiling height of six feet or less.

(F) The city manager or designee may approve other exemptions similar in nature provided the intent of this section is met.

(iv) The maximum main floor area for cottages is 800 square feet. For the purposes of this calculation, the area of interior stairway may be allocated between floors served.

(v) A minimum of 40 percent of the cottages and not more than 60 percent shall have main floors of 700 square feet or less. For example: in a five-cottage development, two of the cottages would need to have main floors of 700 square feet or less and the other three cottages could have main floors of up to 800 square feet. For fractional numbers 0.5 and above, round up; below 0.5, round down.

(vi) The total square foot area of a cottage dwelling unit may not be increased beyond the requirements of this code. A note shall be placed on the title to the property for the purpose of notifying future property owners that increasing the total square footage of the structures, or any subsequent structures, is prohibited. 

(c) Required Minimum Open Space.

(i) Intent. The minimum open space requirements are intended to provide a sense of openness and visual relief in cottage housing developments. The calculations for common open space shall provide a centrally located, focal area for the cottage housing development. The common area shall not include wet stormwater ponds, wetlands, streams, lakes, sensitive area buffers, other setbacks required as pursuant to this chapter, and shall be on slopes of 20 percent or less and developed and maintained so it is usable for active or passive recreation activities. Private open space shall provide a private area around the individual dwellings to enable diversity in landscape design.

(ii) Requirements. Common open space shall:

(A) Be a minimum of 400 square feet per cottage.

(B) Abut at least 50 percent of the cottages in a cottage housing development.

(C) Have cottages abutting on at least two sides. 

(d) Cottages shall:

(i) Be oriented around and have the main entry from the common open space.

(ii) Be within 60 feet walking distance of the common open space.

(e) Private open space shall:

(i) Be a minimum of 300 square feet of private, contiguous, usable open space adjacent to each dwelling unit, for the exclusive use of the cottage resident. It shall be oriented toward the common open space as much as possible, with no dimension less than 10 feet.

(ii) Additionally, cottages shall have a roofed entry porch at least 80 square feet in size with a minimum dimension of eight feet on any side. The porch shall be visually open to the commons. This porch shall not be enclosed.

(3) Parking Location and Screening.

(a) Intent. To ensure minimal visual impact from vehicular use and storage areas for residents of the cottage housing development as well as adjacent properties, and to maintain a single-family character along public streets.

(b) Requirements. Parking shall be:

(i) Located on the cottage housing development property.

(ii) Screened from public streets and adjacent residential uses by landscaping or architectural screening.

(iii) Located in clusters of not more than six adjoining spaces.

(iv) Prohibited in the front yard setback area. (See Footnote 6, Cottage Housing Developments Site Requirements Chart.)

(v) Prohibited within 40 feet of a public street, except: single-loaded parking is allowed in a maximum 50-foot-wide area when set back a minimum of 15 feet from a public street. (See Figure 1.)

(vi) Allowed between or adjacent to structures only when it is located toward the rear of the principal structure and is served by an alley or private driveway.

(vii) A pitched roof design is required for all parking structures. If a parking structure is attached to a cottage unit, it must be served by an alley or private driveway, not accessible from the common area.

(viii) The planning manager may approve other methods provided the intent of this section is met.

(c) Requirements for Individual Garages.

(i) Vehicular access for garages and parking may not be from the entry/porch elevations of the cottages.

(ii) A detached garage serving an individual unit shall be limited to a total gross floor area of 312 square feet, with length or width not to exceed 24 feet, and height not to exceed 16 feet, or the ridgeline height of the unit it serves, whichever is less.

(iii) Garages may be “bundled” together in pairs with a common wall provided the restrictions listed in subsection (3)(c)(ii) of this section are met with respect to the individual unit the garage serves.

(4) Community Buildings. The cottage housing development shall contain community building(s) that are clearly incidental in use and size and related to the dwelling units. Such community buildings shall be located on the same site as the cottage housing development and be commonly owned by the residents. 

(5) Existing Dwellings. One existing detached or attached single-family dwelling that is incorporated into a cottage housing development as a residence and is nonconforming with respect to the standards of this section shall be permitted to remain on a site of six or more cottages used for a cottage housing development. However, the extent of the noncompliance may not be increased unless the proposed change is determined by the planning manager to be consistent in character, scale and design with the cottage housing development. The existing dwelling may be counted as a cottage in the density calculation for the site. (Ord. 785 § 8, 2006).

18.58.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to permit such flexibility of design, placement of buildings, use of open spaces, circulation facilities, off-street parking areas, and performance criteria which will result in development that protects the designated environmentally sensitive areas of no less than 10 acres, with steep slopes and shorelines, and to allow development which is more appropriate to those areas than that which would result from traditional lot by lot development. This chapter will promote:

(1) A desirable and stable environment in harmony with that of surrounding areas;

(2) The intents and purposes of existing single-family zoning;

(3) Quality and architectural styles that will be consistent with neighboring residential community; and

(4) The best utilization of sites characterized by special features of geography, topography, size or shape, in a manner that will preserve the sensitive portions of the site, including unique natural landscapes, trees, streams, wildlife, or other amenities deemed valuable to the community.

(5) All planned residential development projects, as defined by this chapter, shall conduct an LID site analysis in accordance with NPMC 13.08.050. Site assessment findings shall be a component of the project submittal.

(6) The LID standards set forth in Chapter 13.08 NPMC apply to all planned residential development projects defined in this chapter. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 1, 1982).


18.58.020 Definitions.

Definitions used in this chapter shall be the same as those used in NPMC Titles 13, 14, 16, 17 and 18. Whenever the letters PRD are used, such letters shall mean “planned residential development” within this chapter, within application forms, documents submitted or developed in connection with such development application, minutes of the planning commission or city council, and other written items relative to such development. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 2, 1982).


18.58.030 Preliminary and final development plans – Application forms.

For each PRD, a preliminary and final plan shall be submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendations to the city council. The form on which applications are made for planned residential development shall be approved by the planning commission. No application shall be dated as accepted for review until or unless the city engineer certifies that the application complies with plans, reports, and other technical material required by this code. Such plans, reports, and related information shall be in sufficient detail to enable the planning commission to evaluate the proposed development in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and to make recommendations to the city council based upon such plans and information. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 3, 1982).


18.58.040 Initiation of PRD project – Application.

Planned residential development projects shall be submitted with an application form furnished by the city and filed by the owner or owners of all property involved. Whenever an application is filed by more than one owner, the application shall recite a willingness by the owners to enter into a binding agreement within the proposed PRD whereby the planned residential features such as open spaces, greenbelts, access, parking, and similar items shall be retained and maintained in a covenant running with the lands involved within the planned residential development. Additional guarantees including but not limited to bonds may be required by the city council. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 4, 1982).


18.58.050 Requirement of PRD by city council.

Upon receiving an application for a subdivision or plat with a designated environmentally sensitive area of no less than 10 acres with steep slopes and shorelines, the city planning commission may recommend to the city council that a determination be made as to the appropriateness and beneficial effect of a PRD. The city council may require a PRD in lieu of the usual platting/subdivision; provided land proposed for development meets the criteria of this chapter as to designation of environmentally sensitive lands. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 5, 1982).


18.58.060 Procedural requirements.

(1) In addition to complying with the requirements of this chapter, all PRDs shall be consistent with the intent of NPMC Titles 13, 14, 16, 17 and 18 and with the comprehensive plan for the city. The four steps in the procedure are:

(a) Review of and recommended approval by the planning commission of the conceptual and preliminary plan for development; and

(b) Review of and approval by the city council of the conceptual and preliminary plan for development; and

(c) Review of and recommended approval by the planning commission of the final plan for development; and

(d) Review of and approval by the city council of the final plans for development, by authorizing ordinance.

(2) The authorizing ordinance for the final plan(s) for development shall provide the specific elements to be permitted within the PRD; provided, however, that such restriction does not apply to the specific design for each dwelling unit. Such designs may be presented conceptually in order to encourage and permit flexibility and variety to accommodate the existing market demands. Every other element shall be illegal unless granted through a subsequent revision of the PRD, by ordinance, in the same manner as the original grant of PRD. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 6, 1982).

18.58.250 Use control – Setbacks.

The minimum distance between a building and the exterior boundary or outer perimeter of a PRD parcel to be developed shall be 25 feet. Such 25 feet may be utilized for sidewalks, paths, or walkways, and shall be landscaped as hereinafter provided and maintained as a common area and open space. This minimum may be adjusted if it is determined that such provision will either minimize the impact on adjacent residential property, or will not adversely affect such adjacent residential property. Any modification shall be endorsed upon the approved site plan. No structure or appurtenance shall be constructed to project into any open space or setback requirement.

(1) For single-family structures unattached to other single-family structures, the setback between such structures shall not be less than 10 feet, measured horizontally from closest building protrusion from outer edge of overhang.

18.58.260 Numbers of single-family dwelling units allowed.

The number of single-family residential units shall be the same as allowed by the underlying zoning except as provided in this section. The number of single-family dwelling units shall be determined by:

(1) Using the gross area of parcel(s) being developed, subtract 15 percent, unless it can be demonstrated that more or less would be required for streets/utilities access and rights-of-way, to find the net area; and

(2) Divide the net area of the parcel by the minimum lot size per single-family dwelling required by the underlying zone, to find the number of single-family units allowed under such zoning; and

(3) Multiply the resulting number of single-family units by 1.1 to determine the maximum numbers of single-family dwelling units allowable under the PRD regulations. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 20, 1982).

After a public hearing the council may revoke the approval and/or permits by ordinance. Nothing in this section shall limit the revocation of building permits, issuance of stop work orders, or other such procedures elsewhere authorized when deemed appropriate for compliance with the city code. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 29, 1982).


18.58.360 Abandonment – Time limitations.

If any PRD project, or any phase or division of a PRD project is abandoned, or if, upon the expiration of two years from the adoption of the authorizing ordinance for any division or phase of a PRD project, the off-building site improvements have not been completed and common open space has not been planted or have not been commenced pursuant to any extension of time for completion granted by the city council, such completion being determined by requirements of the ordinance, agreements, contracts, or other documents/drawings governing same, the authorization for the project shall automatically expire and no building or occupancy permits shall thereafter be issued, renewed, or extended.

Amendments or alterations to the PRD shall include, but shall not be limited to, any exterior structural changes, any exterior upgrading that structurally alters the building(s), or amenity changes that were specifically provided by city code and contracts, or protected by covenants. Such alteration or change must be compatible with the overall intent and design scheme of the PRD as originally approved. (Ord. 955 § 5 (Exh. 5), 2017; Ord. 412 § 31, 1982).


18.58.380 Schedules of fees and charges.

18.82.010 Purpose and intent.

(1) The purpose of the transfer of development rights (TDR) program is to implement a market-based tool to permanently preserve land with important public benefits, such as farmland, forestland, open space, and wildlife habitat, through the acquisition of transferable development rights from those lands (“sending sites”) and the subsequent transfer of those rights to lands more suitable for development (“receiving sites”), and thereby help the city achieve its growth management objectives. 

(2) The TDR provisions supplement land use regulations, resource protection efforts and open space acquisition programs and are intended to increase residential and commercial development density in the Manhattan Village subarea by:

(a) Providing incentive process for rural property owners of farmland, forestland, open space, and wildlife habitat to preserve lands with a public benefit;

(b) Providing an administrative review process to ensure that transfers of development rights are evaluated and administered in a fair and timely manner in accordance with other city goals and policies; and

(c) Providing an incentive to urban property owners in the Manhattan Village subarea to redevelop property to create a vibrant urban village. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012).


18.82.020 Authority.

This chapter is adopted pursuant to RCW 36.70A.090, Comprehensive plans – Innovative techniques, which states, “A comprehensive plan should provide for innovative land use management techniques, including, but not limited to, density bonuses, cluster housing, planned unit developments, and the transfer of development rights.” (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012).


18.82.030 Applicability.

(1) All new development on a site identified as a receiving site pursuant to NPMC 18.82.040 shall have the option to acquire certified transfer of development rights to increase the development potential of the receiving site. 

(2) The development potential of a sending site, as determined by site certification pursuant to Chapter 21A.37 KCC, may be transferred and credited to a receiving site only when the transfer is approved in accordance with this chapter and the King County-Normandy Park TDR interlocal agreement. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012).


18.82.035 Designated sending sites.

(1) Pursuant to the King County-Normandy Park TDR interlocal agreement, the county and city have identified the near-shore and shoreline properties surrounding Vashon Island in King County as the TDR eligible “sending site area” as identified in the TDR sending map in the Normandy Park-King County TDR interlocal agreement. TDR credits from this area may be used for increased residential density and commercial development capacity in the Manhattan Village receiving site. 

(2) Transferable development rights acquired from eligible sending sites shall be transferred to eligible receiving sites through the TDR transfer process described in NPMC 18.82.060. 

(3) After completion of the transfer of a sending site’s development rights, the sending site property shall be maintained in a condition that is consistent with the criteria in this chapter under which the sending site was qualified by means of a TDR conservation easement.

(4) Sending sites shall be qualified and certified by King County pursuant to Chapter 21A.37 KCC. (Ord. 888 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012).


18.82.040 Designated receiving sites.

18.150.010 Purpose and applicability.

This chapter describes how the city of Normandy Park will process the land use and development applications described herein. Any conflicts between the requirements and procedures set forth in this chapter and any other requirement or procedure set forth in the Normandy Park Municipal Code shall be resolved in favor of this chapter to the extent consistent with state law. (Ord. 924 § 1, 2015).


18.150.020 Authority to interpret chapter and development regulations.

The city manager or his or her designee shall have the authority to issue formal written interpretations of the provisions of this chapter and the city’s development regulations, including but not limited to the provisions of NPMC Titles 9, 12, 13, 16, 17, and 18. (Ord. 924 § 1, 2015).


18.150.030 Application types and classification.

(1) Applications for permits and approvals described in this chapter shall be classified as Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV, Type V, or exempt permits. Table 18.150.030(4) classifies those permits and approvals required by the Normandy Park Municipal Code and specifies the review authority.

(2) Unless otherwise required by law, where the city must approve more than one application for a given development to proceed, all applications required may be submitted for review at one time. Where more than one application is submitted for a given development, all applications shall be processed using the highest-number procedure (excluding Type V procedures) that applies to any of the applications. Type V actions are not subject to this subsection. Where a Type I, II, III, or IV permit requires a Type V approval in order to proceed, e.g., a rezone that requires a comprehensive plan amendment, the Type V approval must be obtained prior to submittal of the Type I, II, III, or IV permit application.

(3) If Table 18.150.030(4) does not expressly provide for review using one of the five types of procedures, and another procedure is not required by law or by ordinance, the city manager or his or her designee shall classify the application as one of the permit types according to the following guidelines and principles:

(a) The act of classifying an application shall be a Type I permit action.

(b) Questions about what procedure is appropriate shall be resolved in favor of the type providing the greatest notice and opportunity to participate.

(c) The city manager or his or her designee shall consider the following guidelines when classifying the procedure type for an application:

(i) A Type I permit involves an application that is subject to clear, objective and nondiscretionary standards or standards that require the exercise of professional judgment about technical issues, and that is exempt from SEPA review. The decision maker is the building official, the planning manager, or the city manager.

(ii) A Type II permit involves an application that is subject to objective and subjective standards that require the exercise of discretion about nontechnical issues and about which there may be a limited public interest. The decision maker is the city manager.

(iii) A Type III permit involves a quasi-judicial application that is subject to standards that require the exercise of substantial discretion and about which there may be a broad public interest. The decision maker is the hearing examiner, except that the planning commission is the decision maker for Tier 2 design review permits.

(iv) A Type IV permit also involves a quasi-judicial application that is subject to standards that require the exercise of substantial discretion and about which there may be a broad public interest. The planning commission makes a recommendation to the city council and the city council is the decision maker.

(v) A Type V permit is a legislative action that involves the creation, implementation or amendment of policy or law by ordinance. The planning commission makes a recommendation to the city council and the city council is the decision maker. References to a Type V action being a permit or requiring an application are not intended to imply that the action is a “project permit” or that a “project permit application” within the meaning of RCW 36.70B.020 is required, nor is it intended to imply that such an action is appealable under the Land Use Petition Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW.

(vi) An exempt permit involves an application for which a unique process is described in statute or ordinance or that the Normandy Park city council has decided to exclude from the processes set forth in this chapter pursuant to RCW 36.70B.140. Permits or approvals to use, vacate or transfer streets, public rights-of-way, parks and similar types of public property are exempt from RCW 36.70B.160 through 36.70B.180 and 36.70B.110 through 36.70B.130.
