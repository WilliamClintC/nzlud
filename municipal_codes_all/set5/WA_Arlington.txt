ARLINGTON, WASHINGTON - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
Arlington, Washington 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
 
\PREFACE 
The Arlington, Washington Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1970, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Joseph P. Matthews, Jr., City Attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No.2020-011, passed May 18, 2020.

This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Chapter 2.72 - PURCHASING AND SMALL WORKS ROSTER PROCEDURE[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2010-029, §§ 1—8, adopted Dec. 20, 2010, amended and repealed the former Ch. 2.72, §§ 2.72.010—2.72.030; §§ 2.72.040—2.72.070, and enacted a new Ch. 2.72 as set out herein. The former Ch. 2.72 pertained to bidding procedure/small works roster. For complete derivation see the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List at the end of this volume. 
 
2.72.010 - Small works roster procedures. 
(a)  Cost. The city need not comply with formal sealed bidding procedures for the construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair or improvement of real property where the estimated cost does not exceed three hundred thousand dollars, which includes the costs of labor, material, equipment and sales and/or use taxes as applicable. The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the small works roster process. 
(b)  Publication. At least once a year, the city or its agent shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the city a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit the names of contractors for such roster or rosters. Responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time that they complete the online application and meet minimum state requirements for roster listing. The city may require master contracts be signed that become effective when a specific award is made using a small works roster. 
(c)  Electronic, telephone, or written quotations. The city shall obtain electronic, telephone, or written quotations for public works contracts from contractors on the appropriate small works roster to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to a contractor who meets the mandatory bidder responsibility criteria in RCW 39.04.350(1) and may establish supplementary bidder criteria under RCW 39.04.350(2), as follows: 
(1)  A contract awarded from a small works roster will not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitations. 
(2)  Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster. As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least five contractors on the appropriate small works roster who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate roster. "Equitably distribute" means that the city may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster over other contractors on the appropriate small works roster who perform similar services. 
If the estimated cost of the work is from one hundred fifty thousand dollars to three hundred thousand dollars, the city may choose to solicit bids from less than all the appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster but must also notify the remaining contractors on the appropriate small works roster that quotations on the work are being sought. The city has the sole option of determining whether this notice to the remaining contractors is made by: 
(A)  Publishing notice in a legal newspaper in general circulation in the area where the work is being done; 
(B)  Mailing a notice to these contractors; or 
(C)  Sending a notice to these contractors by facsimile or other electronic means; 
(3)  At the time bids are solicited, the city representative shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor's bid for the same project; 
(4)  A written record shall be made by the city representative of each contractor's bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone inquiry; and 
(d)  Limited public works process. If a work, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement project is estimated to cost less than thirty-five thousand dollars, the city may award such a contract using the limited public works process provided under RCW 39.04.155 (3). For a limited public works project, the city will solicit electronic or written quotations from a minimum of three contractors from the appropriate small works roster and shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder as defined under RCW 39.04.010. After an award is made, the quotations shall be open to public inspection and available by electronic request. 
For limited public works projects, the city may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of Chapter 39.08 RCW and the retainage requirements of Chapter 60.28 RCW, thereby assuming the liability for the contractor's nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, material men, suppliers, and taxes imposed under Title 82 RCW that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project. However, the city shall have the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor's behalf. 
The city shall maintain a list of the contractors contacted and the contracts awarded during the previous twenty-four months under the limited public works process, including the name of the contractor, the contractor's registration number, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed, and the date the contract was awarded. 
(e)  Determining lowest responsible bidder. The city shall award the contract for the public works project to the lowest responsible bidder provided that, whenever there is a reason to believe that the lowest acceptable bid is not the best price obtainable, all bids may be rejected and the city may call for new bids. A responsible bidder shall be a registered and/or licensed contractor who meets the mandatory bidder responsibility criteria established by Chapter 133, Laws of 2007 (SHB 2010) and who meets any supplementary bidder responsibly criteria established by the city. 
(f)  Life cycle costing. In considering bids for the construction of public works projects, whenever there is a reason to believe that applying the "life cycle costing" method to bid evaluation would result in the lowest total cost to the city, first consideration shall be given to the bid with the lowest life cycle cost which complies with the specifications. "Life cycle cost" means the total cost of an item to the city over its estimated useful life, including costs of selection, acquisition, operation, maintenance, and where applicable, disposal, as far as these costs can be reasonably determined, minus the salvage value at the end of its estimated useful life. The "estimated useful life" of an item means the estimated time from the date of acquisition to the date of replacement or disposal, determined in any reasonable manner. 
(g)  Award. All of the telephone bids or quotations shall be collected and presented at the same time to the city council for consideration, determination of the lowest responsible bidder, and award of the contract. The city reserves its right under applicable law to reject any or all bids, and to waive procedural irregularities. 
(Ord. No. 2010-029, § 2, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 2012-018, § 1, 10-15-2012)  
2.72.020 - Consulting services roster. 
(a)  Consulting services. Consulting services are professional services that have a primarily intellectual output or product and include architectural and engineering services as defined in RCW 39.80.020. 
(b)  Publication. At least once a year, on behalf of the city, the city's agent shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction a notice of the existence of the consulting services roster or rosters and solicit statements of qualifications from firms providing consulting services. Such advertisements will include information on how to find the address and telephone number of a representative of the city who can provide further details as to the city's projected needs for consulting services. Firms or persons providing consulting services may complete the online application at any time and be listed if they meet the minimum state requirements. 
(c)  Professional architectural and engineering services. The city's agent will distinguish between professional architectural and engineering services as defined in RCW 39.80.020 and other consulting services and will announce generally to the public the city's projected requirements for any category or type of professional or other consulting services. The city reserves the right to publish an announcement on each occasion when professional services or other consulting services are required by the city and to use paper and/or other electronic rosters that may be kept on file by appropriate city departments. 
(Ord. No. 2010-029, § 3, 12-20-2010; Ord. No. 2012-018, § 2, 10-15-2012)  
2.72.030 - Purchasing procedures. 
Except as provided in AMC 2.72.010 and .020 or as otherwise provided by law, the city shall follow its current "Purchasing Policies and Procedures", as adopted by resolution, true copies of which shall be available for inspection in the city clerk's office. 
(Ord. No. 2010-029, § 4, 12-20-2010)  
2.72.062 - Contractors eligible to apply to be on small works roster. 
(a)  At least once every year, the city or its agent shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation a notice of the existence of the small works roster and soliciting the names of contractors for such roster. The city shall add to the small works roster those qualified contractors who respond to the published notice and request to be included on the roster. 
(b)  In order to be included on the roster, the contractor shall supply information on a contractor qualification form to be developed by the public works director or his or her designee. The contractor qualification form shall include as a minimum the name and address of the contractor, the contractor's Washington registration number, the contractor's insurance company, the contractor's bonding company, and the contractor's area of work. The city may require this information to be updated annually.

(1)  Additional real property tax shall be imposed on the value of the non-qualifying improvements in the amount that would be imposed if an exemption had not been available under this chapter, plus a penalty equal to twenty percent of the additional value.

A lien under this section has priority to, and shall be fully paid and satisfied before, a recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the property may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes. An additional tax unpaid on its due date is delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest shall be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent property taxes. 
(d)  Upon a determination that a tax exemption is to be terminated for a reason stated in this section, the Director shall notify the record owner of the property as shown by the tax rolls by mail, return receipt requested, of the determination to terminate the exemption. The owner may appeal the determination to the city, within thirty days by filing a notice of appeal with the city, which notice shall specify the factual and legal basis on which the determination of termination is alleged to be erroneous. At an appeal hearing, all affected parties may be heard and all competent evidence received. After the hearing, the governing authority shall either affirm, modify, or repeal the decision of termination of exemption based on the evidence received. An aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the governing authority to the superior court as provided in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598. 
(e)  Upon determination by the city to terminate an exemption, the county officials having possession of the assessment and tax rolls shall correct the rolls in the manner provided for omitted property under RCW 84.40.080. The county assessor shall make such a valuation of the property and improvements as is necessary to permit the correction of the rolls. The value of the new industrial/manufacturing facilities added to the rolls is considered new construction for the purposes of RCW Chapter 84.40. The owner may appeal the valuation to the county board of equalization as provided in RCW Chapter 84.40. If there has been a failure to comply with this chapter, the property shall be listed as an omitted assessment for assessment years beginning January 1st of the calendar year in which the noncompliance first occurred, but the listing as an omitted assessment may not be for a period more than three calendar years preceding the year in which the failure to comply was discovered.

Each application shall be complete and signed by the person who intends to conduct, operate or engage in the business for which the license is to be issued, and shall state the nature of the business, its proposed address and telephone number(s), the names and addresses of all owners of the business (or their registered agent), and such other information as may be required by the city clerk. 
(b)  If the applicant is a partnership, the application must be made and signed by one of the partners; if a corporation, by one of the officers thereof; if a foreign corporation, partnership or nonresident individual, by the resident agent or local manager of the corporation, partnership or individual. 
(c)  If the business premises are to be located on property owned by another person, the application shall include written evidence of the property owner's consent. 
(d)  The city clerk shall forward copies of all applications to appropriate city department and divisions. All departments and divisions shall conduct current review of applications and report their approval or denial back to the city clerk within twenty working days of the date the application was received and the city clerk shall act on the license application within twenty-five working days of the same being submitted. 
(e)  If the city clerk receives a recommendation of denial from any city official because of noncompliance with city regulations or policy, the applicant shall be notified and provided sufficient time (generally two weeks) to amend his/her application so as to comply with the appropriate regulations. 
(f)  If an application is denied, the reason for denial shall be stated in writing. The applicant shall have a period of ten days after a license denial to appeal the decision to the city's hearing examiner. Upon receiving such an appeal, the hearing examiner shall review the application and any staff recommendations to consider whether or not the license should be issued. The applicant has the right to provide testimony to the hearing examiner prior to his decision. Such review and testimony may be in the form of a meeting, a conference call, or through the submission of written argument, the choice being the applicants. The applicant shall be given not less than seven days advance notice of the review. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, subject only to an appeal filed with Snohomish County Superior Court within fourteen days following the date of such decision. 
(g)  Neither the filing of an application for a license or the renewal thereof, nor any payment of any application or renewal fee, shall authorize a person to engage in or conduct a business until such license has been granted or renewed. 
(Ord. 1386 §12, 2006: Ord. 932 §1(part), 1988).  
5.28.130 - Term of license and renewals. 
(a)  All business licenses issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be valid until June 30th; and all renewals thereafter shall be for a period of one calendar year commencing on July 1st of each year. 
(b)  Applications for renewal of business licenses must be completed and returned to the city clerk, together with the renewal fee, prior to June 30th of each year. The city clerk shall send a renewal notice to each licensee at the last address provided to the city. Failure of the licensee to receive any such form shall not excuse the licensee from making application for and securing the required renewal license, or from payment of the license fee when and as due hereunder. A business license shall expire on June 30th of the year following issuance, if not renewed as described herein. 
(c)  Renewals may only be applied for within sixty days prior to the expiration of an existing license. 
(Ord. 1386 §13, 2006: Ord. 932 §1(part), 1988).  
5.28.140 - Compliance with all other codes when a business changes. 
Whenever a business changes in operation, use, number or employees, amount of services (e.g., sewer, water, etc.) it uses, etc., and the changes adversely affect the service or the site's ability to minimize off-site impacts, it is the owner's responsibility to comply with all codes regulating those particular issues. For example, if employees are added, but there is only enough on-site parking for the original number, then more spaces need to be added. Similarly, if a manufacturing process changes such that additional sewage is generated, then additional connection charges may be required. Generally, such changes shall be reported on business license renewal forms. However, the obligation to upgrade a site or service commences with the actual change in the businesses. 
(Ord. 1386 §14, 2006: Ord. 932 §1(part), 1988).  
5.28.150 - Fees and penalties.

(b)  The annual license fee shall accompany the application. 
(c)  If pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the applicant's request for a license is denied, either upon original application or renewal, twenty-five percent of the fee tendered shall be retained as a processing fee and seventy-five percent of the fee tendered shall be refunded to the applicant no later than ninety days following such denial. 
(d)  There shall be assessed a late payment penalty, as set by resolution, for late payment of the annual fee. This penalty shall be added to the license fee. 
(e)  A fee for an appeal of a decision to issue a license, as set by resolution, shall be paid by the applicant. Such fee shall cover the cost of engaging a hearing examiner and any staff time or other costs incurred by the city in processing said appeal.

5.28.180 - Hearing required for license suspension or revocation.

9.28.050 - Graffiti nuisance. 
A.  Graffiti Deemed Nuisance. Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, fences, gates and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city, constitute a nuisance. Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of malicious mischief and vandalism involving the application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, oftentimes it is difficult to identify, or to identify and convict, the wrongdoer. The continued presence of graffiti is a blight on the community. While voluntary graffiti removal should be encouraged, where graffiti has not been promptly removed, graffiti should be removed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following words shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  "Abate" means the removal, painting over, or other obscuring of graffiti from view as directed by the notice provided for in AMC 9.28.050 D(2). 
(2)  "Graffiti" means the defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public or private buildings, structures, facilities, natural features, and places. 
(3)  "Graffiti nuisance property" means property upon which graffiti exists and where, after notice as provided by this chapter, the graffiti has not been abated by the deadline set in a notice as established by the chapter. 
(4)  "Owner" means any entity or entities having a legal or equitable interest in real or personal property including but not limited to the interest of a tenant or lessee. 
(5)  "Responsible party" means an owner, and also an entity or person acting as an agent for an owner, or an entity or a person who has dominion and control over a property. There may be more than one responsible party for a particular property. 
C.  Continued Presence of Graffiti an Infraction. It shall be a civil infraction for a responsible party to allow a graffiti nuisance property to exist. Each day a graffiti nuisance property shall exist shall be a separate infraction. A civil infraction under this chapter shall be punishable by a penalty of one hundred dollars for each violation. 
D.  Notice of Removal. 
(1)  Whenever graffiti exists and is visible to any person of normal eyesight utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other facility open to the general public, the responsible person shall abate such graffiti nuisance within forty-eight hours of the placement of the graffiti. 
(2)  Whenever the responsible party fails to abate and remove graffiti as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, and whenever the chief of police or his/her designated representative determines that graffiti exists, a notice shall be issued to the responsible person to abate the nuisance by a stated deadline, which shall be no more than forty-eight hours after the date of the notice unless weather or seasonal conditions require a longer deadline. 
(3)  The giving of notice as required by this section shall be accomplished by providing the notice to the responsible party in any one of the following way: 
(a)  By personal service on the responsible party; 
(b)  By registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed and mailed to the last known address of the responsible party and to the address of where the graffiti exists. 
(4)  The notice shall be as established by the chief of police. The notice shall include a list of community resources and references where the property owner may seek assistance in the eradication of graffiti. 
E.  Appeal. 
(1)  The hearing examiner for the city of Arlington hereby is given jurisdiction to hear appeals of a "Notice of Graffiti" or "notice of Graffiti Nuisance Property." An appeal shall be commenced by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten days after the service of the "Notice of Graffiti" or "Notice of Graffiti Nuisance Property" on the party or parties to whom the notice is directed. If no appeal is filed within ten days, the "Notice of Graffiti" or "Notice of Graffiti Nuisance Property" shall become final and conclusive, and not subject to appeal or review in any forum. 
(2)  In any appeal, the city shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property contains graffiti, the named party is a responsible party, the deadline for abatement is reasonable and should not be adjusted for weather or seasonal conditions, and the manner of abatement is reasonable. 
(3)  If the hearing examiner finds that the property contains graffiti and that the named party is a responsible party, but that either the manner of abatement is not reasonable, or the deadline should be extended for seasonal or weather conditions, then the hearing examiner shall modify the manner of abatement to make the same reasonable or extend the deadline a reasonable period to account for seasonal or weather conditions, as the case may be. 
(4)  The hearing examiner shall issue a written decision containing the following information: 
(a)  Findings of fact (which shall include the common address and legal description for the property) and conclusions of law; 
(b)  The manner of any required abatement action and the deadline by which abatement must be completed; 
(c)  A description of the civil penalty for an infraction which may accrue if the responsible party fails to abate the graffiti by the deadline established in the decision and order; 
(d)  A statement that the decision of the hearing examiner becomes final twenty-one days after the date of the decision unless the decision of the hearing examiner is appealed to the Snohomish County Superior Court; and 
(e)  A statement that if the graffiti is not abated by the deadline established in the decision and order that the city or its contractor may abate the graffiti and the cost of abatement will be a personal obligation of the responsible party and a lien against the graffiti nuisance property. 
(5)  The hearing examiner shall mail his/her decision to the named party by regular and certified mail, and a copy of the decision also shall be posted on the property in a conspicuous location. 
(6)  Any review of the decision of the hearing examiner must be by land use petition filed within twenty-one days of issuance of the decision and order in the Snohomish County Superior Court in accordance with the Land Use Petition Act. 
F.  Removal by City. When the deadline established under this chapter has passed, and the property is deemed graffiti nuisance property, the city may abate the graffiti nuisance property. Either city resources or contractors may be used in abating the graffiti nuisance property. Using any lawful means, the city and its representatives may enter upon the graffiti nuisance property and abate the graffiti. The city may seek judicial process or writ as is deemed necessary to carry out the abatement. 
G.  City Cost Recoverable—Debt—Lien. If the city is required to remove graffiti and abate a graffiti nuisance property, the city shall bill the cost of removal and abatement to the responsible party. The costs billed shall be due and payable to the city within ten calendar days of billing. The costs billed shall include the value of the use of city staff and resources (at the current established hourly rate) and all payments made to third parties. If the costs billed are not paid when due, they shall be a personal debt of the responsible party and automatically the costs shall be a lien upon the graffiti nuisance property. The city may take all lawful actions to collect the debt of the responsible party or to foreclose its lien upon the graffiti nuisance property. 
H.  Rewards. The city may offer a reward not to exceed three hundred dollars for information leading to the identification and apprehension of any person who willfully damages or destroys any public or private property by the use of graffiti. The actual amount awarded (not to exceed three hundred dollars) shall be determined in the discretion of the chief of police. In the event of damage to public property, the offender or the parents or legal guardian of any unemanicipated minor must reimburse the city for any reward paid. In the event of multiple contributors of information, the reward amount shall be divided by the city in the manner it shall deem appropriate. Claims for rewards under this section shall be filed with the chief of police or his designee in the manner specified by the Arlington police department. No claim for a reward shall be allowed unless the city investigates and verifies the accuracy of the claim and determines that the requirements of this section have been satisfied.

Chapter 9.56 - PUBLIC SOLICITATION AND CAMPING 
 
9.56.010 - Findings. 
The city council finds as follows: 
(1)  Consistent with the findings of other Washington State Cities, the city council finds that it is important to the general welfare of the citizens and residents of the city to protect and preserve the public safety of pedestrians and to insure the safe and efficient movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic in public places. The city council further finds that public rights of way serve the primary purpose of enabling pedestrian and vehicular traffic to safely and efficiently move about from place to place and that public rights of way have become increasingly congested and should be maintained to serve their primary purpose. 
(2)  Arlington, as well as other cities in Washington, has experienced an increase in the number of incidents of coercive solicitation by individuals towards pedestrians, vehicular traffic and others and that such interference in public places can cause citizens to reasonably fear for their safety, and can cause children and the elderly to feel compelled to make donations they would not otherwise be willing to make out of fear for their safety. 
(3)  The city has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens and its most vulnerable residents and visitors from threatening, intimidating or harassing behavior caused by coercive solicitations, in preserving the quality of life and in protecting and preserving public health, safety and welfare. 
(4)  The City has an interest in discouraging the use of public parks as temporary living quarters.

Vehicles impounded by the city pursuant to this chapter shall be redeemed only under the following circumstances: 
(1)  An impounded vehicle may be redeemed only by the legal owner, the registered owner, a person authorized in writing by the registered owner or the vehicle's insurer, a person who is determined and verified to have the permission of the registered owner of the vehicle, or one who has purchased a vehicle from the registered owner and who produces either proof of ownership or written authorization and signs a receipt therefor. 
(2)  Any person redeeming a vehicle properly impounded by the city shall pay the towing contractor for the costs of impoundment (removal, towing and storage) prior to redeeming such vehicle. The towing contractor shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120, as now or hereafter amended. 
(3)  Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded as a result of a parking or traffic citation has a right to a hearing to contest the validity of the impoundment or the amount of towing and storage charges imposed. Any such request for hearing must be in writing, in a form approved by the Snohomish County District Court—Cascade Division, and signed by such person, and received by the court within ten days after the requesting person received notice of the impound and opportunity for a hearing. Such hearing shall be provided as follows: 
(A)  The court, within five days after receiving the request for a hearing, shall, in writing, notify the towing contractor, the person requesting the hearing if not the owner, the registered and legal owners of the vehicle, and the person or agency authorizing the impound of the hearing date and time. 
(B)  If all the requirements to redeem the vehicle have been satisfied, the impounded vehicle shall be released to such person immediately, and a hearing as provided for in AMC 10.54.130 shall be held within ninety days of the written request for a hearing. 
(C)  If all the requirements to redeem the vehicle have not been satisfied, the impounded vehicle shall not be released to such person until after the hearing provided pursuant to AMC 10.54.130. Such person shall have the right to a hearing within seven business days (Monday through Friday, excluding court holidays) of the court's receipt of the written request for a hearing. 
(D)  Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within ten days of receiving notice of the opportunity therefor shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing, and the registered owner of the impounded vehicle shall be liable for any towing and storage fees incurred in relation to the vehicle.

10.54.130 - Post-impound hearing procedure. 
Hearings requested pursuant to AMC 10.54.120 shall be held in the Snohomish County District Court—Cascade Division, which court shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated removal, towing and storage fees charged were proper. 
(1)  At the hearing, the person requesting the hearing may produce any relevant evidence to show that the impoundment, towing, or storage fees charged were improper. The court may consider a written report made under oath by the officer who authorized the impoundment in lieu of the officer's personal appearance at the hearing. An abstract of the driver's driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver's license, permit or privilege to drive and that the driver was in fact convicted of each offense listed on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle. 
(2)  If the impoundment is found to be proper, the court shall enter an order so stating. In the event that the costs of impoundment (removal, towing and storage fees) have not been paid, the court's order shall provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment to the city of any fines imposed on the underlying citation and the costs of impoundment to the towing company, as well as payment of all court costs associated with the hearing. In the event that the court grants time payments, the city shall ensure that the costs of impoundment are ultimately paid to the towing company. The court shall grant time payments only upon a showing of extreme financial need, and where there is an effective guaranty of payment. 
(3)  If the impoundment is determined to be improper, the court shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. The court shall order that the registered and legal owner of the vehicle shall bear no impoundment, towing, or storage fees, and that the city shall be liable for any such fees. The court shall enter judgment in favor of the towing contractor against the city for the impoundment, towing, and storage fees paid. In addition, the court shall enter judgment in favor of the registered and legal owner of the vehicle and against the city for the amount of the filing fee for the impound hearing petition. 
(4)  In the event that the court finds that the impoundment was proper but that the removal, towing and storage fees charged for the impoundment were improper, the court shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment have been paid, the court shall enter a judgment against the towing company and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment for the amount of the overpayment. 
(5)  No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on any subsequent criminal prosecution and such determination shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution. 
(Ord. No. 2020-002 , § 46, 2-18-2020)  
10.54.140 - Record of impounded vehicles.

(Ord. No. 2020-002 , § 47, 2-18-2020)  
10.54.150 - Registered owner responsible—Presumption. 
(a)  Every person in whose name a vehicle is registered shall be responsible for any violation of this chapter caused by the parking, standing or stopping of said vehicle in violation hereof. It shall be no defense that the vehicle was parked illegally by another, unless proof is presented that said vehicle had been stolen and had not been returned to the registered owner by the date of the violation. This section shall not apply to registered owners transferring vehicle ownership who have complied with RCW 46.52.104 prior to the date of the violation. 
(b)  In any parking violation case involving a violation of this chapter relating to the stopping, standing or parking of a vehicle, proof that the particular vehicle described in the notice of parking violation was stopping, standing or parking in violation of any such provision of this chapter, together with proof of registered ownership of the vehicle at the time of the violation, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who parked or placed the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred provided the procedure for issuing a parking violation set forth in this chapter has been followed. 
(Ord. No. 2020-002 , § 48, 2-18-2020)  
10.54.160 - Violation—Infraction. 
A person violating any provision of this chapter commits an infraction, for the violation of which they shall pay a civil penalty in a sum to be set by city resolution, plus court fees, where applicable. 
(1)  Parking infractions shall be paid at the City of Arlington Finance Department at city hall, 238 N. Olympic Avenue, Arlington in person or by mail within fifteen days of issuance. 
(2)  The fine for all parking infractions paid on the city's next full business day after the citation is given shall be reduced by one-half the fine amount. 
(3)  For payments made by mail, a postmark shall serve as the date the payment is made. 
(4)  A parking infraction may be contested by notifying the finance department within fifteen days of issuance and requesting a hearing. 
(5)  Requests to contest infractions must be made in writing and signed by the owner of the vehicle. 
(6)  When a request for a contested hearing is made, the finance department will forward a notice of infraction to the municipal court for a hearing. 
(7)  The fine for parking infractions that are neither contested nor paid within fifteen days of issuance shall be doubled. 
(8)  Failure to remit the fine within fifteen days of receiving a reminder notice from the municipal court that the fine is due will result in the inability to renew the vehicle registration without remitting the fine. 
(9)  If no response or payment is made within fifteen calendar days from the date of issuance of the notice of parking violation, the penalty for each violation may be referred to a collection agency thirty days from the due date, or fifteen days after the penalty is due, pursuant to RCW 3.02.045 and 19.16.500. The violator may be liable for any and all collection costs. 
(10)  For all infractions that are neither contested nor paid within fifteen days of issuance, the municipal court shall send the vehicle owner a reminder notice stating that payment has not been made and describing the consequences of non-payment set forth in subsections (g) through (i).

11.01.010 - Purpose. 
The enforcement of the city regulations throughout the city is an important public service. Code enforcement is vital to protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. It is the policy of the city to emphasize code compliance by education and prevention as a first step. This policy is designed to ensure code compliance, timely action, and uniformity in its implementation. While warnings and voluntary compliance are desirable as a first step, enforcement up to and including civil and criminal penalties should be used as needed to assure and effect code compliance. Abatement or remediation should be pursued when appropriate and feasible. Uniform and efficient procedures, with consistent application tailored by regulation should be used to accomplish this policy. 
This chapter will establish an efficient system to enforce the regulations identified in Section 11.01.020(16), to provide an opportunity for a prompt hearing on alleged violations of such regulations, to establish monetary penalties for violations as authorized by RCW 35A.11.020, and to establish a standard procedure to be used by the city to abate unsafe or unlawful conditions. 
It is not the intent of this chapter to empower any city employee or official to initiate complaints within the city limits. The complaint process shall be initiated by citizens within the city. However, this shall not preclude any employee or official of the city during their normal course of duty from filing a complaint with code enforcement should they witness any act that is illegal, a threat to health or safety, or which causes damage to or jeopardizes the integrity or functionality of city infrastructure. 
All complaints filed by city employees or officials shall be subject to the same process as any citizen generated complaint.

An appropriate bill of sale, easement and any other document needed to convey the improvements to the city and to ensure right of access for maintenance and replacement shall be provided, along with documentation of the actual costs of the improvements and a certification by the applicant that all of such costs have been paid, all of which shall be in a form acceptable to the city, before any reimbursement shall be paid to the applicant. 
(b)  In the event that actual recoverable costs are less than the estimate used in calculating the estimated fees by ten percent or more, the engineer shall recalculate the reimbursement amounts reducing them accordingly and shall cause a revised list of reimbursement amounts to be recorded with the county auditor.

The rates and charges for industrial users, as defined in Sections 13.08.240, 13.08.250, and Chapter 13.36, shall be as follows: 
(1)  All user charges shall be based upon equitable unit charges established for flow BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) loading and TSS (total suspended solids) loading, based upon the average BOD, TSS and other parameter(s) concentrations (as established by the public works director) monitored for the industrial user and the flow recorded in the monitoring manhole or water use. 
(2)  A minimum monthly charge will be established by the city to cover the basic sewer costs and monitoring of the industrial user's wastewater discharge, and in the event the monthly sewer bill does not exceed this amount the industrial user shall agree to pay the estimated minimum monthly charge. This charge shall be reviewed from time to time and adjusted to ensure the charge is covering the monitoring services and sewer costs provided and must be reviewed every two years. Initially, the monthly charges shall be based on the following, unless otherwise established in the negotiated discharge permit: 
(A)  For an industrial user with waste strength less than two hundred fifty mg/l, measured as five-day BOD and TSS, and other parameters within limits established in Sections 13.08.240, 13.08.250, [and Chapter] 13.36, and whose discharge does not require regular monitoring other than flow, the minimum monthly charge is as set forth below: 
Sewer Charges (monthly) 	2020 RATE 
Waste strength <250 mg/l 	$429.00 
 
(B)  For an industrial user with waste strength in excess of two hundred fifty mg/l for two months or more per year, the minimum monthly charge is as set forth below: 
Sewer Charges (monthly) 	2020 RATE 
Waste strength >250 mg/l 	$1,715.00 
 
(C)  Beginning January 15, 2021, and each January 15th thereafter, the charges set forth in subsections (1)(A) and (1)(B), shall be increased annually, by the October reported percentage increase of the consumer price index (CPI) for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area for all urban consumers, or other measure commonly used by the city should it change; provided, however, that notwithstanding any reduction in the CPI, rates shall not decrease. 
(3)  Until such time as a sewer user charge analysis can be conducted to establish equitable charges under a negotiated discharge permit between the city and the industrial user, the following shall be used as the basis for industrial user charges: 
(A)  Flow based charge per cubic foot of wastewater discharged; 
(B)  BOD charge per pound of BOD discharged; and 
(C)  TSS charge per pound of TSS discharged, pursuant to the following table: 
Sewer Charges (monthly) 	2020 RATE 
Flow-based charge (per cubic foot) 	$0.02051 
BOD charge (per pound BOD) 	$0.645 
TSS charge (per pound TSS) 	$0.431 
 
(D)  Beginning January 15, 2021, and each January 15th thereafter, the charges set forth in subsection (c), shall be increased annually, by the October reported percentage increase of the consumer price index (CPI) for the Seattle-Tacoma-Bremerton area for all urban consumers, or other measure commonly used by the city should it change; provided, however, that notwithstanding any reduction in the CPI, rates shall not decrease. 
(4)  Flow shall be based upon one hundred percent of the water consumption or rate of flow of wastewater discharge into the sewer (measured in an industrial user installed flow measurement and recording equipment installed in control manhole, pursuant to Chapter 13.36). Strength of wastewater discharged shall be established based upon twenty-four-hour composite samples made by the city at the control manhole and tested by the city's wastewater treatment plant laboratory or state certified testing laboratory. All testing shall be in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater," APHA, AWWA and WPCF. BOD and TSS, pounds per day, shall be calculated based upon concentration of composite samples and established flow rates. 
(5)  Appeal. 
(A)  If any user believes that a portion of the user's metered flow, larger than ten percent, is not discharged into the sewer system (when flow measurement is not provided in the control manhole), the user should make written application to the public works director for review of the user's flow of wastewater. If the public works director agrees that charges for the user should be adjusted, they shall so notify the city council, which may approve such change, or direct a recomputation of the user's sewer rates. 
(B)  If the public works director does not agree to the adjustment of user charges, the user may further appeal to the city council, which may direct further study or take other appropriate action.

(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.060 - Federal categorical pretreatment standards. 
The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 - 471 are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in full in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.070 - State requirements. 
State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter or other applicable ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.080 - Local discharge limitations. 
(a)  The following discharge limitations are established to prevent site-specific treatment plant and environmental problems. The local discharge limitations under this section are in force for all nondomestic users of the city's wastewater treatment plant. Local discharge limitations for the city are established using the allowable headworks loading method in accordance with the following EPA documents: 
(1)  Guidance Manual on the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations under the Pretreatment Program (1987); 
(2)  Supplemental Manual on the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations Under the Pretreatment Program (1991); 
(3)  PRELIM Version 4.0 Users Guide (1991). 
(b)  The following local discharge limitations are based on a technical analysis of the total loading of pollutants to the river watershed and the requirements of the Washington State Water Quality Standards (Chapter 173-201A WAC) and the Biosolids protection criteria in accordance with 40 CFR Part 503 final rule signed November 25, 1993. 
(c)  Wastewater containing total recoverable metals in concentrations exceeding these local discharge limitations shall not be discharged to the city's collection system or treatment works: 
LOCAL DISCHARGE LIMITATIONS 
Organics as Grab Sample 
100 mg/l FOGs 	1000 mg/l Chlorine

(d)  Local discharge limitations apply at the point where wastewater is discharged to the collection system for all users. Local discharge limitations are in force at all monitoring facilities required under AMC 13.36.520. The director, at his/her option, may elect to have local discharge limitations apply after pretreatment and prior to mixing with other wastewater generated within an individual industrial facility. 
(e)  Local discharge limitations are expressed in units of milligrams of contaminant per liter of solution. The total mass or concentration of the constituent ion shall be limited under these maximum allowable discharge limitations without regard to oxidation state or chelation status. Where the user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard or a specific discharge limitation under a state waste discharge agreement, the more stringent limit or pretreatment standard shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.090 - City's right of revision. 
The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in an amended wastewater discharge agreement, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.100 - Special discharge agreement. 
(a)  The city may enter into wastewater discharge agreements with significant industrial users to accept conventional pollutants compatible with the treatment system at concentrations greater than those typical of domestic wastewater. Users with BOD or TSS levels higher than two hundred fifty mg/l must have a written agreement with the city before commencing discharge. Within such agreements, the city may establish terms of the user's discharge to the POTW, including maximum flow rates. The city may also establish fees, in addition to those established in AMC 13.12, to recover costs associated with treating such wastes and the cost of monitoring to verify operation in accordance with agreements. 
(b)  The adoption of fees shall be in accordance with AMC 13.36.770. In no case shall the discharge of conventional pollutants be allowed where the strength of such pollutants exceeds seven hundred fifty mg/l BOD or seven hundred fifty mg/l TSS. 
(c)  Nondomestic users may be assigned to user groups in accordance with the determination of the director. These nondomestic users may discharge wastewater to the treatment works without a written agreement. However, the user fees applicable to the assigned user group classification must be paid in accordance with the current rate structure adopted by the city. In no case shall the conventional waste strength of any user group classification exceed seven hundred fifty mg/l BOD or seven hundred fifty mg/l TSS. 
(d)  Users discharging or intending to discharge pollutants other than BOD and TSS, and claiming compatibility, must prove to the satisfaction of the director that such pollutants are compatible with the POTW. These cases will be handled on a case-by-case basis by the director. Written approval is required prior to introducing such wastes into the treatment works. Appropriate fees may apply in accordance with the determination of the director. 
(e)  In no case will a special wastewater discharge agreement waive compliance with state or federal pretreatment requirements or standards, including categorical standards. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.110 - Dilution. 
A user shall not increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may impose mass limitations on users which he/she believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.120 - General pretreatment facilities. 
(a)  User(s) shall provide all known, available, and reasonable methods of prevention, control, and treatment (AKART) as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the director, whichever is more stringent. 
(b)  Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. 
(c)  In addition, the director may establish best management practices (BMPs) for particular groups of users. These BMPs may include, but are not limited to, types or methods of pretreatment technology to be used, methods of source control, minimum maintenance requirements, delay prevention practices, good housekeeping, spill prevention practices, or other requirements as deemed necessary. 
(d)  When required by the director, an engineering report, including detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures, shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter. 
(e)  Within ninety calendar days after the completion of the wastewater pretreatment facility, the discharger shall furnish as built drawings and its operations and maintenance procedures. Any subsequent significant changes in the pretreatment facility or method of operation shall be reported to and approved by the director prior to the initiation of the changes. 
(f)  New sources, and new users determined to be significant industrial users (SIUs) must have pretreatment facilities installed and operating prior to discharge, if required. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.130 - Deadline for compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. 
(a)  See AMC 13.36.370 for compliance schedule requirements. 
(b)  Compliance by existing sources (categorical users) covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be as specified in the appropriate standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. The city may establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards. 
(c)  New source dischargers, and "new users" that are determined to be significant industrial users (SIUs), are required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time as determined by the director (not to exceed ninety calendar days from the beginning of discharge). New sources, and "new users" that are determined to be significant industrial users (SIUs), shall install and have in operating condition and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. 
(d)  Any wastewater discharge agreement issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. 
(e)  Any other existing user that is considered to be an SIU, or a categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in noncompliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule to insure compliance within the shortest time feasible. A compliance schedule may be included in the subject user's wastewater discharge agreement. In no case shall compliance with the city's local discharge limitation exceed two years from the date of adoption of said limit by the city. 
(f)  All existing commercial and industrial users not determined by the director to be significant industrial users (SIUs) shall have one year to comply with the requirements of this chapter. Users not considered as significant industrial users may request in writing an extension of the requirement for compliance. Such extensions will be authorized by the director only for good cause. An extension of the compliance deadline is valid only upon receiving written agreement from the director. 
(g)  A specific compliance schedule for pretreatment facilities for sources of fats, oils and grease is included in AMC 13.36.140. 
(h)  Wastewater discharge agreements or contracts between the city of Arlington and any user or sewer utility customer that are in existence on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall remain in full force and effect until the termination date of such wastewater discharge agreement or contract. Each section and subsection of this chapter that is not in direct conflict with an existing wastewater discharge agreement or contract shall become in effect immediately upon the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Application and enforcement of any section or subsection that is in direct conflict with existing wastewater discharge agreement or contract shall be deferred for the duration of the existing wastewater discharge agreement or contract. Where specific requirements of this chapter are not specifically prohibited or addressed under the requirements of an existing wastewater discharge agreement or contract, the presumption shall be that an existing wastewater discharge agreement or contract allows imposition and enforcement of the specific requirements of this chapter. Where an existing wastewater discharge agreement or contract is in conflict with any state or federal regulation or standard, the subject wastewater discharge agreement or contract shall be renegotiated so that compliance with the state and federal requirements is achieved. Wastewater discharge agreements or contracts not in conformance with this chapter or any state or federal regulation or standard shall not be renewed without modifications to bring such contracts into compliance therewith. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)

(2)  It shall also be unlawful for any food service establishment or other person to dispose of any grease waste or processing waste containing oils, greases, solids, or liquids and discharge said waste into any drainage piping, public or private sanitary sewer, storm drainage system, sufficient to interfere with the proper operation of that system, or to discharge said waste to any land, street, public way, river, stream, or other waterway. 
(3)  It shall further be unlawful for any person to allow liquid waste to accumulate on his property or in his possession which is injurious to public health or emits offensive odors. 
(4)  It shall be unlawful for any person to utilize any chemical emulsifying agent for the purpose of hindering or eliminating the interception of fats or grease prior to entering the city's wastewater collection system. 
(5)  Food service establishments and other facilities described in Subsection (d) of this section discharging wastewater shall install, operate, clean, and maintain a sufficiently sized oil and grease, water and solids separator (herein called grease interceptor) necessary to achieve compliance with requirements set forth under this provision. 
(6)  Oil or grease of petroleum or mineral origin shall not be discharged to the city's sewer system at a concentration in excess of one hundred mg/l. 
(7)  Fats, oil or grease of animal or vegetable origin shall not be discharged to the city's sewer system at a concentration in excess of one hundred mg/l. 
(8)  The concentration of oils and grease shall be measured in samples taken from the sampling chamber following pretreatment in an approved grease interceptor in accordance with the requirements of this section. Oil and grease concentration shall be measured using the partition-gravimetric method or the partition-infrared method outlined in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association. 
(b)  Waste Discharge Requirements. 
(1)  Waste discharge from fixtures and equipment in establishments that may contain grease, including but not limited to scullery sinks, pot and pan sinks, vent hood drains, dishwashing machines, soup kettles and floor drains located in areas where grease containing materials may exist, may be drained into the sanitary sewer system only after such discharges are pretreated in an approved grease waste interceptor in accordance with this section. 
(2)  No sanitary wastes from toilets, urinals, or other similar fixtures may be discharged through any grease waste interceptor. All wastes shall enter the interceptor through the inlet pipe only. The wholesale shredding of food wastes into any fixture which discharges to a grease waste interceptor is prohibited. 
(c)  Location. 
(1)  Each grease interceptor shall be so installed and connected that it shall be at all times easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and the removal of the intercepted grease. Location of the interceptor shall meet the approval of the director. 
(2)  Interceptors shall be placed as close as practical to the fixture(s) they serve. 
(3)  Each business establishment for which a grease interceptor is required shall have an interceptor which shall serve only that establishment. 
(d)  Pretreatment Required. 
(1)  Dischargers who operate newly constructed or remodeled restaurants, meat cutting facilities, cafes, lunch counters, bakeries, cafeterias, bars, or clubs; or hotel, hospital, sanitarium, factory or school kitchens; or other establishments that serve or prepare food where FOG may be introduced to the sanitary sewer system shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of FOG. 
(2)  Dischargers who operate automatic and coin-operated laundries, car washes, filling stations, commercial garages or similar businesses having any type of washing facilities (including pressure washing and steam cleaning) or any other dischargers producing grit, sand, oils, lint, or other materials which have the potential of causing partial or complete obstruction of the building site sewer or other areas in the POTW shall install approved interceptors, oil/water separators, or tanks in accordance with specifications adopted by the city of Arlington such that excessive amounts of oil, sand and inert solids are effectively prevented from entering the POTW. 
(e)  Design. 
(1)  Grease interceptors shall be multiple compartment flotation chambers where grease floats to the water surface and is retained while the clear water underneath is discharged. The clear water discharged is subject to the discharge prohibitions of Subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
(2)  The grease interceptor shall be followed by a sampling compartment to allow for monitoring of discharges from the pretreatment unit. The geometry of the sampling compartment shall be in accordance with city of Arlington Standard Plan for Grease Interceptors available at the utility department. Interceptors shall have fittings designed for grease retention.

This liquid or semisolid grease shall be transported to an approved rendering plant. In no case shall free liquid grease be disposed of directly into fixtures which are connected to the sanitary sewer system. Unused butter, margarine, or other solid grease products shall not be discharged to the sanitary sewer system through garbage disposals or other means. No exceptions to the prohibitions of this subsection are allowed for fixtures which discharge to the sanitary sewer system through an approved grease interceptor. Hauling and recycling of restaurant grease shall be accomplished at a facility holding a state rendering permit. 
(h)  Additives. The use of any additive, such as enzymes, chemicals, or bacteria, as a substitute for grease interceptors or the maintenance of grease interceptors is prohibited. The use of additives as a supplement to grease interceptors may be authorized by the director. The director will provide a specific written protocol for testing of additives proposed for use as supplements for grease interceptor or sewer line maintenance. Completion of the testing protocol to the satisfaction of the director at the expense of the grease generator is required prior to use of any additive. Written agreement from the director shall be obtained after completion of the testing protocol to verify that no objection is taken to the use of the proposed additive. In no case shall any additive which emulsifies fats, oils or grease be used. The city will provide a written test procedure for determination of emulsifying agents.

(c)  Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the city or by unit production limits specified in the applicable categorical standards shall report production data as outlined in AMC 13.36.360(b). 
(d)  If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or non-regulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from the regulated process flows, dilution flows and non-regulated flows. 
(e)  Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement; provided, however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an actual measurement is not feasible. 
(f)  Sampling shall be representative of the user's daily operations and shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified herein (see AMC 13.36.480 through 13.36.520). 
(g)  The city may require reporting by users that are not required to have an industrial wastewater discharge agreement if information or data is needed to establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the effluent or determine any other factor which is related to the operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewer system. 
(h)  The city may require self-monitoring by the user or perform the periodic compliance monitoring needed to prepare a periodic compliance report required under this section. If the city performs such periodic compliance monitoring, it will charge the user for such monitoring, based upon the costs incurred by the city for the sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be added to the normal sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the utility bills. The city is under no obligation to perform periodic compliance monitoring for a user.

13.36.480 - Sampling requirements for users. 
(a)  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfide, and volatile organics. The director will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the user will be able to composite the individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of three grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
(b)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city and/or contained in the user's wastewater discharge agreement. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standard(s). 
(c)  All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in its wastewater discharge agreement, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of its self monitoring report. 
(d)  Preserve samples in accordance with the specifications of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, latest edition. 
(e)  Chain of custody documentation may be required by the director for any samples taken pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)

A permanent, digital, recording, totalizing, open channel flowmeter shall be permanently installed in a weatherproof enclosure. The flowmeter installation shall include an appropriate automatic system to measure the water level through the flume at the appropriate control point so that flow rate can be automatically calculated at selected intervals. Measured liquid level readings shall be converted into corresponding flow rates using internal conversion algorithms. 
(d)  The flowmeter shall be capable of initiating the operation of an attached sampler. The flowmeter signal shall be a five to fifteen volt DC pulse or isolated contact closure of at least twenty-five milliseconds duration. Sample interval frequency shall be user selected. 
(e)  The monitoring facility shall be approved by the director in writing prior to construction. Existing monitoring facilities may be approved in lieu of new construction if approval of the installation, in writing, is provided by the director. Monitoring facilities shall include a secure area for placement of a portable sampler owned by the city. 
(f)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling, flow measurement and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
(g)  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. Such monitoring equipment and activities shall be provided at the expense of the user.

Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Said administrative fines shall constitute a sewer service surcharge, and upon assessment, shall be subject to collection in the same manner as all other sewer utility rates, charges and penalties. 
(b)  Unless other arrangements have been made with, and authorized by the director, unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. After ninety calendar days, if charges, fines, and penalties have not been paid, the city may revoke the user's wastewater discharge agreement. 
(c)  Users desiring to appeal and dispute such fines must file a written request for the director and city administrator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten business days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director shall convene a hearing, or meeting, on the matter within seven business days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, any payments made on said fines shall be returned to the user. Affirmance or modification of an administrative fine by the director shall relate back to the original date of assessment. The city shall recover the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, including the cost of additional inspections, sampling and analysis, and may add them to the fine. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Users seeking judicial review of administrative fines must do so by filing a petition for review in the Snohomish County Superior Court within thirty calendar days of the decision of the director. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.620 - Emergency suspensions.

(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.740 - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of Subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five calendar days): 
(A)  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
(B)  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
(C)  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.750 - Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in AMC 13.36.050 (a) and (b)(3) through (7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(a)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(b)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES authorization, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.760 - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections (3) and (4) of this section. 
(c)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW at least ten calendar days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(d)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five calendar days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four hours. 
(e)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (e) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.770 - Pretreatment charges and fees. 
(a)  The director may develop, for city council adoption, reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program. 
(b)  These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other rates or charges for sewer service; provided, that the city shall collect said charges in the same manner as other sewer utility rates are collected, including but not limited to the sewer lien procedures provided under Chapter 35.67 RCW. 
(c)  Fees may include: 
(1)  Fees for Wastewater Discharge Agreements, including the cost of processing the authorization applications, public noticing, issuing and administering the authorization, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;

(d)  All fees or charges will be collected by direct billing. Unless the director has been made aware of extenuating circumstances that would prevent prompt payment, all fees are payable within thirty calendar days of the billing. Fees past due will be considered a violation of this chapter. Users not paying fees within sixty calendar days of the billing period will be subject to termination of service. 
(Ord. No. 2011-008, § 1, 3-7-2011)  
13.36.780 - Non-liability. 
(a)  It is the express purpose of the city of Arlington to establish an industrial pretreatment program in order to provide for and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public. It is not the intent of this chapter to create or otherwise establish or designate any particular class or group of persons who will or should be especially protected or benefited by the terms or requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  It is the specific intent of this chapter to place the obligation of complying with these regulations upon the applicant or discharger and no provision nor any term used in this chapter is intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers, employees or agents, except as provided under the Act or other related statutes of the United States or the state of Washington. 
(c)  Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to be nor shall be construed to create or form the basis for any tort liability on the part of the city or its officer, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from the failure of an applicant or discharger to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or by reason or in consequence of any inspection, notice, order, certificate, permission or approval authorized or issued or done in connection with the implementation or enforcement of this chapter, or inaction on the part of the city related in any manner to the implementation or the enforcement of this chapter by its officer, employees or agent.

Project boundaries shall include all property of a parcel or parcels (where development activity is proposed on more than one parcel) unless the size of the proposed development is relatively small compared to the overall size of the parcel or parcels and sufficient land remains on which an additional permissible use could be developed. In such a case, project boundaries shall be drawn rectangular, or nearly so, so as to intersect and include the property boundary. In no instance shall an applicant be able to draw "project boundaries" simply to avoid required improvements on portions of the property.

(b)  The community development director shall require an applicant to submit evidence of his authority to submit the application in accordance with Subsection (a) whenever there appears to be a reasonable basis for questioning this authority. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.034 - Official representative of the applicant. 
The applicant for each land use permit shall designate an official representative, which may be himself, to receive all correspondence, determinations, and notices regarding the application. The city is not obligated to provide said correspondence, determinations, or notices to any other representative of the applicant, or even the applicant himself if the official representative is anyone other than himself, unless otherwise specified by this title. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.040 - Applications to be complete. 
(a)  All applications for zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permits must be complete before the permit-issuing authority is required to consider the application. 
(b)  Subject to Subsection (c), an application is complete when it contains all of the information that is necessary for the permit-issuing authority to decide whether or not the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with all of the requirements of this title, including a master permit application form signed by both the applicant and the property owner. Generally, an application will be considered complete if it contains all the elements of the list of submission requirements (prepared by the community development director, as authorized in Subsection (e) and they substantially meet the city's standards for such documents (i.e., they contain all the relevant sections, information, and analyses typically required in such documents). This is not to say that errors in the documents or differences of opinion shall constitute incompleteness; such issues may be worked out through the review process or may constitute reasons for denial. 
(c)  In this title, detailed or technical design requirements and construction specifications relating to various types of improvements (streets, sidewalks, etc.) are set forth in one or more of the administratively adopted policies authorized by this title. It is not necessary that the application contain the type of detailed construction drawings that would be necessary to determine compliance with these appendices, so long as the plans provide sufficient information to allow the permit-issuing authority to evaluate the application in the light of the substantive requirements set forth in the text of this title. 
However, whenever this title or a condition of a permit requires a certain element of a development to be constructed in accordance with the detailed requirements set forth in one or more of these administratively adopted polices or other specified standards, then no construction work on such element may be commenced until detailed construction drawings have been submitted to and approved by the public works director. Failure to observe this requirement may result in permit revocation, denial of final subdivision plat approval, or other penalty as provided in Chapter 20.28 (Enforcement and Review). 
(d)  The presumption established by this title is that all of the information set forth in the administrative guideline specifying the information required with applications is necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section. However, it is recognized that each development is unique, and therefore the permit-issuing authority may allow less information or require more information to be submitted according to the needs of the particular case. Generally, the applicant may rely on the recommendations of the community development director as to whether more or less information than that set forth in the administrative guideline entitled "Information Required with Applications" should be submitted; however, the permit-issuing authority reserves the right to require more information if needed to make a decision. 
(e)  The community development director shall develop application forms, a list of submission requirements, instructional sheets, checklists, or other techniques or devices to assist applicants in understanding the application requirements and the form and type of information that must be submitted. In classes of cases where a minimal amount of information is necessary to enable the community development director to determine compliance with this title, such as applications for zoning permits to construct single-family or two-family houses, or applications for sign permits, the community development director shall develop standard forms that will expedite the submission of the necessary plans and other required information. 
(Ord. 1365 § 2, 2005; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.050 - Staff consultation before formal application. 
(a)  Except as provided in Subsection (c), to minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretation, and ensure compliance with the requirements of this title, pre-application consultation between the developer and the planning staff is encouraged as provided in this section. 
(b)  Before submitting an application for a permit the developer shall participate in a pre-application meeting and present to the community development director a sketch plan of such subdivision, drawn approximately to scale (1 inch = 100 feet). The sketch plan shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the developer, 
(2)  The proposed name and location of the subdivision, 
(3)  The approximate total acreage of the proposed subdivision, 
(4)  The tentative street and lot arrangement, 
(5)  Topographic lines, and 
(6)  Any other information the developer believes necessary to obtain the informal opinion of the planning staff as to the proposed subdivision's compliance with the requirements of this title. 
The community development director shall meet with the developer as soon as conveniently possible to review the sketch plan. 
(c)  The community development director may waive the requirement for a pre-application meeting for minor projects that, in his opinion, do not warrant such a meeting. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.060 - Submittal of application. 
(a)  Except as provided in Subsection (d), to minimize development planning costs, avoid misunderstanding or misinterpretations, and ensure compliance with the requirements of this title, a submittal intake appointment is required between the developer and the community development staff as provided in this section. 
(b)  Before submitting an application for a permit the developer shall participate in a submittal intake appointment and present to the community development staff all the elements necessary for such application. 
(c)  Submittal appointments shall be scheduled at least one week prior to the submittal intake appointment. 
(d)  The community development director may waive the requirement for a submittal intake appointment for minor projects that, in his/her opinion, do not warrant such an appointment. 
(Ord. 1411 § 26, 2007).  
20.16.070 - Complete application. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a formal application for a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit, or plat approval, the community development director shall review the application and, at his discretion, confer with the applicant to ensure that the planning staff's interpretation of the applicable requirements of this title is understood, that he has submitted all of the information that he intends to submit, and that the application represents precisely and completely what he proposes to do. 
(b)  The community development director will process the permit application concurrently with the SEPA process. 
(c)  Within twenty-eight days after receiving a permit application, the community development director shall mail or provide in person a written determination to the applicant, stating either: 
(1)  That the application is complete; or, 
(2)  That the application is incomplete and what is necessary to make the application complete. To the extent known, the community development director shall identify other agencies of local, state, or federal governments that may have jurisdiction over some aspect of the application. 
(d)  The application is deemed complete if the city does not provide a written determination to the applicant that the application is incomplete as provided in Subsection (c). 
(e)  Within fourteen days after an applicant has submitted to the community development director the additional information identified as being necessary for a complete application, the community development director shall notify the applicant whether the application is complete or what additional information is necessary. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.074 - Vesting of permits. 
Land use permit applications shall be considered vested on the date that an application is deemed complete pursuant to Section 20.16.070 (Complete Application) and applications shall be processed under the land use regulations in effect on that date. However, subsequent permits on the same property are not vested on this date. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.080 - Processing multiple permits. 
(a)  Whenever a proposed project requires more than one permit, or multiple permits, by this title, the entire application will be linked and processed simultaneously using the process specified for the permit requiring the highest degree of review and decision-making. 
(b)  Where another agency with jurisdiction requires a public meeting or open record hearing as a part of their permitting process, any public meetings or open record hearings required by this title may be combined with those of the other agency with jurisdiction provided that the requirements of Section 20.24.014 (Combining Hearings With Those of Other Agencies) are met. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.090 - Distribution of application. 
Upon receipt of a special use or conditional use permit application, the planning official shall, in addition to all interested city departments, send a copy of the application to the authorities and agencies reviewing or furnishing water, fire, school, and sanitary sewer service to the proposed project. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.100 - Zoning permits. 
(a)  A completed application form for a zoning permit shall be submitted to the community development director by filing a copy of the application with the planning department. 
(b)  The community development director shall issue the zoning permit unless he finds, after reviewing the application and consulting with the applicant as provided in Section 20.16.050 (Staff Consultation Before Formal Application), that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within his jurisdiction according to the table of permissible uses, or 
(2)  The application is incomplete, or 
(3)  If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this title (not including those requirements concerning which a variance has been granted or those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in Chapter 20.32, Nonconforming Situations), or 
(4)  The proposed project has not complied with SEPA, or 
(5)  The proposed project is not in conformance with the comprehensive plan or other adopted plans, regulations, or policies. 
(c)  In considering the permit application, the community development director shall not consider the following issues, which have already been decided by the city council through their previous actions of adopting the comprehensive plan and land use code: 
(1)  Whether the proposed use, if identified by Section 20.40.010 (Table of Permissible Uses) as a permissible use in the zoning district, should be a permissible use; 
(2)  Whether the proposed residential densities, if identified by Section 20.48.020 (Residential Density) as a permissible density in the zoning district, should be allowed; 
(3)  Whether public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan are available and adequate, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by 36.70A RCW. 
(d)  Except as specified in Subsection (e), if the community development director decides that if it would be in the best interest of the project and/or community to provide notice of the project, he shall, at least ten days before taking final action on the permit request, send a written notice to those persons who have listed for taxation real property any portion of which is within five hundred feet of the lot that is the subject of the application, informing them that: 
(1)  An application has been filed for a permit authorizing identified property to be used in a specified way, 
(2)  All persons wishing to comment on the application should contact the community development director by a certain date, and 
(3)  Persons wishing to be informed of the outcome of the application should send a written request for such notification to the community development director. 
(e)  In the case of zoning permits for short subdivisions, the community development director shall always issue public notice as described in Subsection (d). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.110 - Authorizing use or occupancy before completion of development under zoning permit. 
In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the zoning permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship), it would be unreasonable to require the zoning permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this title prior to commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings, the community development director may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings (insofar as the requirements of this title are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a performance bond or other security satisfactory to the community development director to ensure that all of the requirements of this title will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve months) determined by the community development director. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.120 - Notice of application filed. 
(a)  The community development director shall give public notice of any application filed for a special or conditional use permit or a variance by issuing, distributing, and advertising a "Notice of Application Filed" as follows: 
(1)  Notice shall be given to the appellant or applicant and any other person who makes a written request for such notice by mailing to such persons a written notice not later than fourteen days after the determination of complete application has been made per Section 20.16.070 (Complete Application). 
(2)  Notice shall be given to neighboring property owners by mailing a written "Notice of Application Filed" within fourteen days after the determination of complete application has been made per Section 20.16.070 (Complete Application) to those persons who have listed for taxation real property any portion of which is located within five hundred feet of the lot that is the subject of the application or appeal or, where the owner of the subject parcel owns other contiguous lots not under application, within five hundred feet of all contiguously owned lots. 
(3)  A copy will be posted on the official notification boards of the city. 
(4)  A copy will be sent to appropriate city or county officials if the proposed project adjoins their jurisdiction or has potential impacts on their capital improvements or services. 
(5)  A copy will be sent to the state department of transportation if the proposed project is adjacent to the right-of-way of a state highway or has potential impacts on their facilities or level of service. 
(6)  A copy will be sent to all other agencies with jurisdiction. 
(7)  Notice shall be given to other potentially interested persons by publishing a notice one time in a newspaper having general circulation in the area. 
(8)  The applicant shall erect public notice signs, of a format approved by the community development director, as soon as possible after the determination of complete application has been made per Section 20.16.070 (Complete Application) as follows: 
(A)  A copy of the notice described in Subsection (9) shall be attached to each sign. 
(B)  One sign shall be erected on the subject property facing and readable from each accessible public right-of-way adjacent to the subject property. 
(9)  The notice required by this section shall provide the following information: 
(A)  The date of application, the date of issuance of the "Notice of Complete Application," and the date of issuance of the "Notice of Application Filed." 
(B)  The date, time, and place of any neighborhood meeting held pursuant to Section 20.16.130 (Neighborhood Meetings for Conditional Use Permits Required); 
(C)  Any person's right to request a hearing on the matter, with an explanation that the decision is administrative (made by the community development director) unless a hearing is requested as per Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits); 
(D)  Reasonable identification of the lot that is the subject of the application or appeal (give the street address of the property, or if this is not available, a locational description in non-legal language); 
(E)  A brief description of the action requested or proposed, including the number of lots proposed for a subdivision, and any proposed modifications or variances; 
(F)  A list of all permits required in the application; 
(G)  The name of the applicant and the proposed project; 
(H)  The official file number and a statement of its availability for review, including any existing studies, environmental documents, or other material related to the project; 
(I)  If applicable, a list of any studies requested; 
(J)  A list of other permits required by other agencies with jurisdiction, to the extent known by the city; 
(K)  A statement of the right of any person to submit written testimony to the appropriate permit-issuing authority and to appear at any public meeting or hearing on the project to give testimony orally;

(b)  If the responsible official issues a determination of significance on the project concurrently with the notice of application, then the notice of application shall be combined with the notice of determination of significance and EIS scoping notice. 
(c)  The public shall have fourteen days in which to make comments on the application regarding the completeness of the application, the quality or quantity of the information presented, the project's conformance to applicable plans or code, and, in the case of a variance or special use permit, the request for a public hearing. Where a public hearing is required or requested, comments addressing the project's conformance to applicable plans or code will continue to be accepted until the close of the public hearing. 
(Ord. 1438 § 2, 2007; Ord. 1351 § 3, 2004; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.130 - Neighborhood meetings for conditional use permits required. 
(a)  All applications for conditional use permits shall be publicly scoped through a public neighborhood meeting. Upon receiving an application for a conditional use permit the community development director shall schedule a scoping meeting to occur within one month of receipt, but should be held at the earliest time possible while allowing for adequate noticing as per Subsection (c). 
(b)  Neighborhood meetings shall generally be held between five and six thirty p.m. just prior to a scheduled planning commission meeting unless circumstances require otherwise. 
(c)  A "Notice of Application Filed" shall be distributed and advertised per Section 20.16.120 (Notice of Application Filed). 
(d)  The intent of neighborhood meetings shall be to involve the public as early as possible in the permit process, so that potential issues are raised at the beginning, rather than the end, of the permit process and that solutions may be found during the process. To this end, the meeting shall be an informal gathering of interested parties, at which (i) a brief presentation of the project shall be made by the applicant (or the community development director if the applicant is not present); (ii) the community development director will raise any potential issues; and (iii) any participant may raise any potential issues relevant to the project. Solutions to any potential problems need not be found at this point but may be discussed. The community development director shall take notes of the issues raised in the neighborhood meeting and place a record of them in the official file of the project. 
(e)  Participation or lack of participation in a neighborhood meeting in no way limits an applicant's, the city's, or any other person's standing to participate in later processes or required hearings on the permit application. 
(Ord. 1438 § 3, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.134 - Fire marshal approval prior to issuance of permits. 
No zoning, special use, or conditional use permit shall receive final approval until the fire marshal has verified that the provisions of AMC Title 15 are satisfied. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.140 - Special use permits and conditional use permits. 
(a)  An application for a special use permit shall be submitted to the community development director or hearing examiner, whomever shall be the decision-maker as per Subsection (b), by filing a copy of the application with the community development director in the planning department. An application for a conditional use permit shall be submitted to the hearing examiner by filing a copy of the application with the community development director in the planning department. 
(b)  Decisions on special use permits are: 
(1)  Made by the community development director unless any interested party requests a hearing before the hearing examiner by the close of the review period of the notice of application filed, required per Section 20.16.120 (Notice of Application Filed). 
(2)  Made by the hearing examiner if a hearing is requested, in which case the community development director shall forward the special use permit application to said board for their consideration. 
(c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the designated decision-maker shall issue the requested permit unless it concludes, based upon the information submitted at a hearing if there is a hearing or by signed letter if there is not, that: 
(1)  The requested permit is not within its jurisdiction according to the table of permissible uses, or 
(2)  The application is incomplete, or 
(3)  If completed as proposed in the application, the development will not comply with one or more requirements of this title (not including those the applicant is not required to comply with under the circumstances specified in Chapter 20.32, Nonconforming Situations), or 
(4)  The proposed project has not complied with SEPA, or 
(5)  The proposed project is not in conformance with the comprehensive plan, transportation plan, or other adopted plans, regulations, or policies. 
(d)  Even if the permit-issuing authority finds that the application complies with all other provisions of this title, it may still deny the permit if it concludes, based upon the information submitted at the hearing, that if completed as proposed, the development, more probably than not: 
(1)  Will materially endanger the public health or safety, or 
(2)  Will materially harm adjoining or abutting property, 
(3)  In terms of design and use will not be compatible with the area in which it is located. 
(e)  In considering the permit application, the community development director or hearing examiner, as the case may be, shall not consider the following issues, which have already been decided by the city council through their previous actions of adopting the comprehensive plan and land use code: 
(1)  1. Whether the proposed use, if identified by Section 20.40.010 (Table of Permissible Uses) as a permissible use in the zoning district, should be a permissible use; 
(2)  Whether the proposed residential densities, if identified by Section 20.48.020 (Residential Density) as a permissible density in the zoning district, should be allowed; 
(3)  Whether public facilities identified in the comprehensive plan are available and adequate, if the plan or development regulations provide for funding of these facilities as required by 36.70A RCW. 
(Ord. 1438 § 2, 2007; Ord. 1312 § 4, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.150 - Burden of presenting evidence; burden of persuasion. 
(a)  The burden of presenting a complete application (as described in Section 20.16.040, Applications To Be Complete) to the permit-issuing authority shall be upon the applicant. However, unless prior to the time that a decision is made the permit-issuing authority informs the applicant in what way the application is incomplete and offers the applicant an opportunity to complete the application, the application shall be presumed to be complete. 
(b)  Once a completed application has been submitted, the burden of presenting evidence to the permit-issuing authority sufficient to lead it to conclude that the application should be denied for any reasons stated in Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits) shall be upon the party or parties urging this position, unless the information presented by the applicant in his application and at the public hearing is sufficient to justify a reasonable conclusion that a reason exists to so deny the application. 
(c)  The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the development, if completed as proposed, will comply with the requirements of this title remains at all times on the applicant. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.160 - Recommendations on special use or conditional use permit applications. 
(a)  When presented to the community development director for an administrative decision or to the hearing examiner at a hearing, the application for a special use or conditional use permit, as the case may be, shall be accompanied by a report setting forth: 
(1)  The planning staff's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with Section 20.16.040 Applications To Be Complete) and the other requirements of this title, 
(2)  All decisions and recommendations made as of the date of the report on all project permits included in the consolidated permit process that do not require an open record pre-decision hearing, 
(3)  A statement referencing the responsible official's threshold determination, 
(4)  Any mitigation required or proposed under the city's SEPA authority, 
(5)  As well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the permit-issuing authority. 
(b)  The report may be the land use permit. 
(c)  If the staff proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with Section 20.16.040 Applications To Be Complete or any other requirement of this title, it shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions. 
(d)  The permit-issuing authority may, by general rule applicable to all cases or any class of cases, or on a case-by-case basis, refer applications to the next higher decision-making level to obtain its recommendations. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.170 - Hearing examiner action on conditional use permits. 
(a)  When presented to the hearing examiner, the application for a conditional use permit shall be accompanied by a report setting forth the planning staff's proposed findings concerning the application's compliance with Section 20.16.040 (Applications To Be Complete) and other requirements of this title, as well as any staff recommendations for additional requirements to be imposed by the hearing examiner. 
(b)  If the staff proposes a finding or conclusion that the application fails to comply with Section 20.16.040 (Applications To Be Complete) or any other requirement of this title, it shall identify the requirement in question and specifically state supporting reasons for the proposed findings or conclusions. 
(c)  The hearing examiner shall consider the application and the attached staff report in a timely fashion, and hear from the applicant or interested members of the public. (Notice to the adjoining property owners is provided for in Section 20.24.020 Public Notice.) The hearing examiner, at his discretion, may limit testimony in duration and/or number of times. 
(d)  In response to concerns expressed by the hearing examiner, planning staff, or public testimony, the applicant may modify his application during the hearing, and the planning staff may likewise revise its recommendations. If a project is modified in such a manner as to make the proposed use more intense, then the project shall be denied without prejudice and a new application shall be filed. The new application shall conform to the standards and procedures of this title. 
(e)  In considering whether to approve an application for a conditional use permit, the hearing examiner shall proceed according to the following format: 
(1)  The hearing examiner shall consider whether the application is complete. If no evidence is presented that the application is incomplete (specifying either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete) then this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the hearing examiner that the application is complete. 
(2)  The hearing examiner shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of this title. If a finding to this effect can be made, the hearing examiner need not make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a finding cannot be made then a finding shall be made that the application be found not in compliance with one or more of the requirements of this title. Such a finding shall specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. Separate findings may be made with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the hearing examiner to be unsatisfied through this process. 
(3)  If the hearing examiner concludes that the application fails to comply with one or more requirements of this title, the application shall be denied. If the hearing examiner concludes that all such requirements are met, he shall issue the permit unless he denies the application for one or more of the reasons set forth in Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits). Specific findings for such a denial must be made, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.180 - Community development director or hearing examiner action on special use permits. 
In considering whether to approve an application for a special use permit, the community development director or hearing examiner, whichever is the appropriate permit-issuing authority per Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits), shall proceed in the same manner as the Hearing Examiner when considering conditional use permit applications (Section 20.16.170 Hearing Examiner Action on Conditional Use Permits). 
(1)  The permit-issuing authority shall consider whether the application is complete. If the permit-issuing authority concludes that the application is incomplete and the applicant refuses to provide the necessary information, the application shall be denied. A finding to this effect shall specify either the particular type of information lacking or the particular requirement with respect to which the application is incomplete. If a finding to this effect is not made this shall be taken as an affirmative finding by the permit-issuing authority that the application is complete. 
(2)  The permit-issuing authority shall consider whether the application complies with all of the applicable requirements of this title. If a finding to this effect is made, the permit-issuing authority need not make further findings concerning such requirements. If such a finding is not made, then a finding shall be made that the application is not in compliance with one or more requirements of this title. Such a finding shall specify the particular requirements the application fails to meet. A separate finding may be made with respect to each requirement not met by the application. It shall be conclusively presumed that the application complies with all requirements not found by the permit-issuing authority to be unsatisfied through this process. As provided in Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits), if the permit-issuing authority concludes that the application fails to meet one or more of the requirements of this title, the application shall be denied. 
(3)  In response to concerns expressed by the permit-issuing authority, planning staff, or public testimony, the applicant may modify his application during the hearing, and the planning staff may likewise revise its recommendations. If a project is modified in such a manner as to make the proposed use more intense, then the project shall be denied without prejudice and a new application shall be filed. The new application shall conform to the standards and procedures of this title. 
(4)  If the permit-issuing authority concludes that all such requirements are met, it shall issue the permit unless it makes a finding to deny the application for one or more of the reasons set forth in Subsection 20.16.140(d) (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits). If the application is denied for such reasons, the permit-issuing authority shall make specific findings, based upon the evidence submitted, justifying such a conclusion. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.190 - Additional requirements on zoning, special use, and conditional use permits. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (b), in granting a zoning, special, or conditional use permit, the community development director or hearing examiner, respectively, may attach to the permit such reasonable requirements in addition to those specified in this title as will ensure that the development in its proposed location: 
(1)  Will not endanger the public health or safety, 
(2)  Will not materially harm adjoining or abutting property, 
(3)  In terms of design and use will be compatible with the area in which it is located, and 
(4)  Will be in conformity with the land-use plan, transportation plan, or other plan officially adopted by the council. 
Such reasonable requirements need not be specifically authorized by other chapters of the AMC but do need to address specifically identified, project-related impacts. 
(b)  The permit-issuing authority may not attach additional conditions that modify or alter the specific requirements set forth in this code unless the development in question presents extraordinary circumstances that justify the variation from the specified requirements. 
(c)  Without limiting the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may attach to a permit a condition limiting the permit to a specified duration. 
(d)  All additional conditions or requirements shall be entered on the permit. 
(e)  All additional conditions or requirements authorized by this section are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as any other applicable requirement of this title. 
(Ord. 1438 § 5, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.194 - Notice of decision. 
Wherever in this title reference is made to the hearing examiner issuing a permit, it is intended to mean that it will provide its decision to the community development director, who shall, within five days of receipt of the decision, render the decision into the form of a permit and mail it to the applicant, any party of record, and any person having made a written request for a copy of the decision. The permit shall act as a notice of decision. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.200 - Authorizing use, occupancy, or sale before completion of development under special use or conditional use permits. 
(a)  In cases when, because of weather conditions or other factors beyond the control of the special use or conditional use permit recipient (exclusive of financial hardship) it would be extremely unreasonable to require the permit recipient to comply with all of the requirements of this title before commencing the intended use of the property or occupying any buildings or selling lots in a subdivision, the community development director, in consultation with the public works director and building official, may authorize the commencement of the intended use or the occupancy of buildings or the sale of subdivision lots (but, in the case of subdivisions, not before the subdivision is finalled and recorded) (insofar as the requirements of this title are concerned) if the permit recipient provides a performance bond or other security satisfactory to the board to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within a reasonable period (not to exceed twelve months). 
(b)  When the permit issuing authority imposes additional requirements upon the permit recipient in accordance with Section 20.16.190 (Additional Requirements on Zoning, Special Use, and Conditional Use Permits) or when the developer proposes in the plans submitted to install amenities beyond those required by this title, the community development director, in consultation with the public works director and building official, may authorize the permittee to commence the intended use of the property or to occupy any building or to sell any subdivision lots before the additional requirements are fulfilled or the amenities installed (but, in the case of subdivisions, not before the subdivision is finalled and recorded) if it specifies a date by which or a schedule according to which such requirements must be met or each amenity installed and if it concludes that compliance will be ensured as the result of any one or more of the following: 
(1)  A performance bond or other security satisfactory to the community development director is furnished. 
(2)  A condition is imposed establishing an automatic expiration date on the permit, thereby ensuring that the permit recipient's compliance will be reviewed when application for renewal is made. 
(3)  The nature of the requirements or amenities is such that sufficient assurance of compliance is given by Section 20.28.040 (Penalties and Remedies for Violations) and Section 20.28.050 (Permit Revocation). 
(c)  With respect to subdivisions in which the developer is selling only undeveloped lots, the council may authorize final plat approval and the sale of lots before all the requirements of this title are fulfilled if the subdivide provides a performance bond or other security satisfactory to the council to ensure that all of these requirements will be fulfilled within not more than twelve months after final plat approval. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.210 - Completing developments in phases. 
(a)  If a development is constructed in phases or stages in accordance with this section, then, subject to Subsection (c), the provisions of Section 20.16.020 (No Occupancy, Use, or Sale of Lots Until Requirements Fulfilled) and Section 20.16.200 (Authorizing Use, Occupancy, or Sale Before Completion of Development Under Special Use or Conditional Use Permits) shall apply to each phase as if it were the entire development. 
(b)  As a prerequisite to taking advantage of the provisions of Subsection (a), the developer shall submit plans that clearly show the various phases or stages of the proposed development and the requirements of this title that will be satisfied with respect to each phase or stage. 
(c)  If a development that is to be built in phases or stages includes improvements that are designed to relate to, benefit, or be used by the entire development (such as a swimming pool or tennis courts in a residential development) then, as part of his application for development approval, the developer shall submit a proposed schedule for completion of such improvements. The schedule shall relate completion of such improvements to completion of one or more phases or stages of the entire development. Once a schedule has been approved and made part of the permit by the permit-issuing authority, no land may be used, no buildings may be occupied, and no subdivision lots may be sold except in accordance with the schedule approved as part of the permit, provided that: 
(1)  If the improvement is one required by this title then the developer may utilize the provisions of Subsections 20.16.200(a) or 20.16.200(c), 
(2)  If the improvement is an amenity not required by this title or is provided in response to a condition imposed by the board, then the developer may use the provisions of Subsection 20.16.200(b). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.220 - Expiration of permits. 
(a)  Zoning (other than for preliminary short plats), special use, conditional use (other than for preliminary major plats), and sign permits shall expire automatically if, within two years after the issuance of such permits: 
(1)  The use authorized by such permits has not commenced, in circumstances where no substantial construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work is necessary before commencement of such use, or 
(2)  Less than ten percent of the total cost of all construction, erection, alteration, excavation, demolition, or similar work on any development authorized by such permits has been completed on the site. With respect to phased development (see Section 20.16.210, Completing Developments in Phases), this requirement shall apply only to the first phase. 
(b)  Zoning permits for preliminary short plats or conditional use permits for major plats shall expire automatically if, within seven years after the issuance of such permits: 
(1)  The plat has not been finalled, or 
(2)  A one-year extension has not been granted per Subsection (e). 
(c)  If, after some physical alteration to land or structures begins to take place, such work is discontinued for a period of one year, then the permit authorizing such work shall immediately expire. However, expiration of the permit shall not affect the provisions of Section 20.16.230 (Effect of Permit on Successors and Assigns). 
(d)  For zoning, special use, conditional use other than for preliminary short or major subdivisions, and sign permits the permit-issuing authority may extend for a period up to twelve months the date when a permit would otherwise expire pursuant to Subsections (a) or (b) if it concludes that (i) the request was delivered in writing to the planning department at least thirty calendar days prior to the permit's expiration date, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive extensions may be granted for periods up to twelve months upon the same findings. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit, though a fee may be set by resolution for the processing of extensions. 
(e)  For permits for preliminary short or major subdivisions the permit-issuing authority may extend for a period of one year from the date when a permit would otherwise expire pursuant to Subsections (a) or (b) if it concludes that (i) the request was delivered in writing to the planning department at least thirty calendar days prior to the permit's expiration, (ii) the permit recipient has proceeded with due diligence and in good faith, and (iii) conditions have not changed so substantially as to warrant a new application. Successive extensions may not be granted. All such extensions may be granted without resort to the formal processes and fees required for a new permit, though a fee may be set by resolution for the processing of extensions. Once a permit for a short or major subdivision expires the subdivision may not be finalled and/or recorded. 
(f)  For purposes of this section, the permit within the jurisdiction of the hearing examiner is issued when he decides to approve the application and issue the permit. A permit within the jurisdiction of the community development director is issued when the earlier of the following takes place: 
(1)  A copy of the fully executed permit is delivered to the permit recipient, and delivery is accomplished when the permit is hand-delivered or mailed to the permit applicant; or 
(2)  The community development director notifies the permit applicant that the application has been approved and that all that remains before a fully executed permit can be delivered is for the applicant to take certain specified actions. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of Chapter 20.32 (Nonconforming Situations), this section shall be applicable to permits issued prior to the date this section becomes effective. 
(Ord. 1438 § 6, 2007; Ord. 1411 § 27, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003). 
(Ord. No. 2010-024, 11-15-2010)  
20.16.230 - Effect of permit on successors and assigns. 
(a)  Zoning, special use, conditional use, and sign permits authorize the permittee to make use of land and structures in a particular way. Such permits are transferable. However, so long as the land or structures or any portion thereof covered under a permit continues to be used for the purposes for which the permit was granted, then: 
(1)  No person (including successors or assigns of the person who obtained the permit) may make use of the land or structures covered under such permit for the purposes authorized in the permit except in accordance with all the terms and requirements of that permit, and 
(2)  The terms and requirements of the permit apply to and restrict the use of land or structures covered under the permit, not only with respect to all persons having any interest in the property at the time the permit was obtained, but also with respect to persons who subsequently obtain any interest in all or part of the covered property and wish to use it for or in connection with purposes other than those for which the permit was originally issued, so long as the persons who subsequently obtain an interest in the property had actual or record notice (as provided in Subsection (b)) of the existence of the permit at the time they acquired their interest. 
(b)  Whenever a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit is issued to authorize development (other than single-family or two-family residences) on a tract of land in excess of one acre, nothing authorized by the permit may be done until the owner of record of the property signs a written acknowledgment that the permit has been issued so that the permit may be recorded in the Snohomish County Registry and indexed under the record owner's name as grantor. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.240 - Effect of approval of zoning or conditional use permits for preliminary short or major subdivisions. 
(a)  The approval of a zoning permit for a preliminary short subdivision or a conditional use permit for a preliminary major subdivision constitutes approval of the general concept and layout of the plat as approved. Approval of a permit for a preliminary subdivision does not signify acceptance of engineering details of the plat. These engineering details remain subject to approval by the public works director. 
(b)  Once engineering details and specific design have been approved by the public works director, the owner may obtain necessary permits and construct right-of-way, easement, and utility improvements approved in the permit for the preliminary subdivision. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.250 - Amendments to and modifications of permits. 
(a)  Insignificant design deviations from the permit (including approved plans) issued by the hearing examiner or the community development director are permissible and the community development director may authorize such insignificant deviations. A deviation is insignificant if it has no discernible impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development. Each time an insignificant deviation is requested and approved, a memorandum from the community development director with findings of fact shall be placed in the file for the permit from which it is was granted. If over time the number of insignificant deviations cumulatively requested have or will cause such cumulative changes so that over all they meet the criteria for a minor modification or change, the next subsequent insignificant deviation shall be treated as a modification as per Subsection (b). 
(b)  Minor amendments in permits (including approved plans) are permissible with the approval of the permit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained through written request without a formal application or public hearing, but a payment of any additional fee will be set by resolution. For purposes of this section, amendments are those that have no substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development and do not exceed ten percent of the lots or square footage. Each time a minor modification or change is approved, a memorandum from the permit-issuing authority with findings of fact shall be placed in the file for the permit to which it is was granted. If over time the number of minor modifications or changes cumulatively requested have or will cause such cumulative changes meet the criteria for a major change, the next subsequent minor modification or amendment shall be treated as a major change and be processed per Subsection (c). 
(c)  Major amendments in permits (including approved plans) are permissible with the approval of the hearing examiner or permit-issuing authority. Such permission may be obtained with a formal application and public hearing, if required, and a payment of any additional fee that will be set by resolution. For purposes of this section, major amendments are those that have a substantial impact on neighboring properties, the general public, or those intended to occupy or use the proposed development and do not exceed twenty-five percent of the approved lots or square footage. Each time a major amendment is approved, a memorandum from the permit-issuing authority with findings of fact shall be placed in the file for the permit to which it is was granted. If over time the number of major amendments or changes cumulatively requested have or will cause such cumulative changes exceed the criteria for a major amendment, the next subsequent major amendment shall be treated as a new application and be processed as per Subsection (d). 
(d)  All other requests for changes in approved plans will be processed as new applications. If such requests are required to be acted upon by the hearing examiner or community development director, new conditions may be imposed in accordance with Section 20.16.190 (Additional Requirements on Zoning, Special Use, and Conditional Use Permits), but the applicant retains the right to reject such additional conditions by withdrawing his request for an amendment and may then proceed in accordance with the previously issued permit. 
(e)  The community development director shall determine whether amendments to and modifications of permits fall within the categories set forth above in Subsections (a), (b), and (c), and (d). 
(f)  A developer requesting approval of changes shall submit a written request for such approval to the community development director, and that request shall identify the changes. Approval of all changes must be given in writing. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2010-001, 1-19-2010)  
20.16.260 - Reconsideration of permit-issuing authority's action. 
(a)  Except as pursuant to Subsection (b), whenever (i) the hearing examiner disapproves a conditional use permit application, or (ii) the community development director or hearing examiner disapproves an application for a special use permit or a variance, on any basis other than the failure of the applicant to submit a complete application, such action may not be reconsidered by the respective permit-issuing authority at a later time unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that: 
(1)  Circumstances affecting the property that is the subject of the application have substantially changed, or 
(2)  New information is available that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented at a previous hearing. 
(b)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority approves or disapproves a permit application or variance the respective permit-issuing authority may reconsider such action if either the applicant or a party of record clearly demonstrates that in the written decision for the permit or variance either a finding of fact or testimony has been incorrectly recorded. 
(c)  A request to be heard for reconsideration on this basis must be filed with the community development director within the time period for an appeal to superior court (see Section 20.28.060, Judicial Review). However, such a request does not extend the period within which an appeal must be taken. 
(d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), the hearing examiner or community development director may at any time consider a new application affecting the same property as an application previously denied. A new application is one that differs in some substantial way from the one previously considered. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.270 - Applications to be processed expeditiously. 
Recognizing that inordinate delays in acting upon appeals or applications may impose unnecessary costs on the appellant or applicant, the city shall make every reasonable effort to process appeals and permit applications as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to ensure that all development conforms to the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.280 - Time limits for permit processing. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (b) of this section, the city shall issue its notice of final decision on a permit application within one hundred twenty days after the community development director notifies the applicant that the application is complete, as provided in Section 20.16.070 (Complete Application). In determining the number of days that have elapsed, the following periods shall be excluded: 
(1)  Any period during which the applicant has been requested to correct plans, perform required studies, or provide additional required information. The period shall be calculated from the date the community development director notifies the applicant of the need for additional information until the earlier of the date the community development director determines whether the additional information satisfies the request for information or fourteen days after the date the information has been provided. If the community development director determines that the information submitted by the applicant is insufficient, he shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies and these procedures shall apply as if a new request for studies had been made; 
(2)  Any period during which an environmental impact statement (EIS) is being prepared following a determination of significance (DS) pursuant to the State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA); 
(3)  Any period for administrative appeals of project permits; 
(4)  Any extension of time mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the local government. 
(b)  The time limits established by Subsection (a) do not apply if a permit application: 
(1)  Requires an amendment to the comprehensive plan or a development regulation; 
(2)  Requires approval of a new fully contained community as provided in RCW 36.70A.350, a master planned resort as provided in RCW 36.70A.360, or the siting of an essential public facility as provided in RCW 36.70A.200; or, 
(3)  Is substantially revised by the applicant, in which case the time period shall start from the date at which the revised project application is determined to be complete. 
(c)  If the city is unable to issue its final decision within the time limits provided herein, the community development director shall provide written notice of this fact to the project applicant. The notice shall include a statement of reasons why the time limits have not been met and an estimated date for issuance of the notice of final decision. 
(d)  The city is not liable for damages under this chapter due to the city's failure to make a final decision within the above time limits. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.284 - Time limit for resubmitting additional information. 
If during the course of processing a permit the community development director or hearing body requests additional information or revised plans necessary to continue processing the permit or for determining consistency with this title, the applicant shall submit such information or revised plans within sixty days of the request. An extension of this deadline may be granted by the requesting authority if it is determined that the time is not adequate given the information requested. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.290 - Maintenance of common areas, improvements, and facilities. 
The recipient of any zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permit, or his successor, shall be responsible for maintaining all common areas, improvements, or facilities required by this article or any permit issued in accordance with its provisions, except those areas, improvements, or facilities with respect to which an offer of dedication to the public has been accepted by the appropriate public authority. As illustrations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this means that private roads and parking areas, water and sewer lines, and recreational facilities must be properly maintained so that they can be used in the manner intended, and required vegetation and trees used for screening, landscaping, or shading must be replaced if they die or are destroyed. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.294 - Judicial review of permits. 
The action of the city in granting or denying a permit may be reviewed for unlawful, arbitrary, capricious or corrupt action in Snohomish County Superior Court. The petition for review must be filed within twenty-one calendar days of the final decision of the city on the permit application. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
Part II. - Major and Short Subdivisions 
 
20.16.300 - Regulation of subdivisions. 
Major and short subdivisions are subject to a two-step approval process. Physical improvements to the land to be subdivided are authorized by a conditional use permit or zoning permit, respectively as provided in Part I of Chapter 20.16 (Permits and Final Plat Approval) of this article, and sale of lots is permitted after final plat approval as provided in Section 20.16.360 (Final Short or Major Subdivision Plat Approval Process). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003). 
(Ord. No. 2010-001, § 3, 1-8-2010; Ord. No. 2010-110, 1-19-2010)  
20.16.310 - Applicability. 
The provisions of this section apply to each major or short subdivision of land, or alteration or vacation thereof, applied for after the effective date of this title except as listed below: 
(1)  This section does not apply to cemeteries and other burial plots while used for that purpose. 
(2)  This section does not apply to divisions of lands into lots or tracts each of which is one one-hundred twenty-eighths of a section of land or larger, or five acres or larger if the land is not capable of description as a fraction of a section of land. For purposes of computing the size of any lot under this paragraph, for a lot that borders on a street or road, the lot size shall be expanded to include that area which would be bordered by the centerline of a road or street and the side lot lines of the lot running perpendicular to such centerline. 
(3)  This section does not apply to divisions made by testamentary provisions or by the laws of descent. 
(4)  This section does not apply to boundary line adjustments. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.320 - No subdivision without plat approval. 
(a)  Except as exempted by Section 20.16.310 (Applicability), no person may subdivide his land except in accordance with all of the provisions of this Title. In particular, no person may subdivide his land unless and until a final plat of the subdivision has been approved in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.16.360 (Final Short or Major Subdivision Plat Approval Process) and recorded in the Snohomish County Registry. 
(b)  The Snohomish County Auditor may not record a plat of any subdivision within the city's planning jurisdiction unless the plat has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this title. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.330 - Restrictions on short subdivisions. 
A lot that is created by a short subdivision shall not be further divided by short subdivision for a period of five years following the date of recordation of the last short subdivision of the property. Any further subdivision proposed within said five-year period must be processed as a major subdivision, except as provided in RCW 58.17.060 as amended. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.340 - Vacations of subdivisions. 
Vacations of subdivisions are processed in the same manner as subdivisions, except that in addition to the information listed in Section 20.16.040 (Applications To Be Complete), the following information is also required to be submitted with applications for subdivision vacations: 
(1)  The reasons for vacation. 
(2)  Signatures of all parties having an ownership interest in that portion of the subdivision subject to vacation. 
(3)  If the subdivision is subject to restrictive covenants which were filed at the time of the approval of the subdivision, and the application for vacation would result in the violation of a covenant, the application shall contain an agreement signed by all parties subject to the covenants providing that the parties agree to terminate or alter the relevant covenants to accomplish the purpose of the vacation of the subdivision or portion thereof. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.344 - Boundary line adjustments. 
(a)  Minor lot line adjustments are exempt from the subdivision regulations. Minor lot line adjustments to existing legal lots are permitted when no new lots, tracts, or parcels are created through the process, and the adjusted lots either meet all zoning requirements of this title, or, in the case where any of the existing legal lots are nonconforming, the adjustment would not create a greater non-conformity. 
(b)  Boundary lines may not be adjusted which will result in directional changes in the orientation of the lot(s), tract(s), parcel(s), or building site(s), such as the changing of front yards into side yards or vice versa; or when the adjustment will result in the city being unable to provide adequate utilities. 
(c)  Application for a boundary line adjustment is made by submitting to the community development director a master permit application, a standard affidavit of boundary line adjustment, a survey of the subject property, a current title report (no older than thirty days), and the appropriate processing fee as set by resolution. 
(d)  Said survey for a boundary line adjustment must be conducted by or under the supervision of a registered state-licensed land surveyor. The surveyor shall certify on the boundary line adjustment survey map that it is a true and correct representation of the lands actually surveyed in accordance with city and state law. The survey must indicate that all lot corners are found and staked; show existing and proposed lot lines and all encroachment(s), buildings, and setbacks from property lines; and provide the legal descriptions of the lots being adjusted before and after the boundary line adjustment. 
(e)  When the applicant has complied with all of the requirements of this section and state law and the community development director has signed the boundary line adjustment, then the record of survey and the original affidavit of ownership shall be filed with the county auditor in accordance with RCW Chapter 58.09. 
(Ord. No. 1312, 11-17-2003; Ord. 1351 § 4, 2004: Ord. 1312 § 5, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.350 - Binding site plans. 
The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish an alternative process by which the subdividing of commercial and industrial properties can be done and which specifically depicts lot configurations, street and road improvements, utilities open space and other provisions to ensure a uniform development. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 1, 4-20-2009)  
20.16.351 - Applicability. 
Any person seeking a division of industrial or commercial land for the purpose of lease or sale or transfer of ownership of lots or upon which more than one principal building is to be constructed upon one lot of record is required to have an approved binding site plan prior to any division and development of property and shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 2, 4-20-2009)  
20.16.352 - Standards. 
Binding site plans are subject to the following standards: 
(a)  The binding site plan shall ensure that the collective lots continue to function as one site with respect to, but not limited to, lot access, interior circulation, open space, landscaping, drainage facilities, facility maintenance and parking. 
(b)  The binding site plan shall: 
(1)  Identify the areas and locations of all streets, roads, improvements, utilities, open spaces, sensitive areas, parking areas, landscaped areas, surveyed topography (by a Washington State registered land surveyor) for preliminary map, water bodies and drainage features and building envelopes; 
(2)  Contain inscriptions or attachments setting forth such limitations and conditions for the use of the land as are established by the community development director or the hearing examiner; 
(3)  Contain provisions requiring any development or division of land to be in conformance with the approved site plan; 
(4)  Contain requirements for street right-of-way realignment, dedication or widening either required by the city or by voluntary agreement; and 
(5)  Adhere to all applicable provisions set forth in the land use code. 
(c)  Both the design and development shall preserve the trees and vegetation, natural drainage, existing top soil, and wetlands/critical areas to the fullest extent that is reasonably possible. 
(d)  Conditions of use, maintenance and restrictions on redevelopment of required open space, parking, access and other improvements shall be identified and enforced by covenants, easements, dedications or other similar mechanisms. 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 3, 4-20-2009)  
20.16.353 - Submission requirements. 
Binding site plans shall follow the standard subdivision submittal, review, resubmittal, final approval process and recording requirements as that of that of the standard subdivision per RCW 58.17. 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 4, 4-20-2009)  
20.16.354 - Performance bonds. 
In lieu of completing the required improvements, the applicant may request final approval, subject to the approval of a suitable guarantee by the public works director. The guarantee must be in a form acceptable to the city and in an amount commensurate with improvements to be completed. The amount of the guarantee is established at one hundred fifty percent of the cost of the city having to construct the improvements. 
Guarantee funds will not be released by the city unless approval has been received from all applicable departments that are reasonable for acceptance and/or maintenance of such improvements. 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 5, 4-20-2009)  
20.16.355 - Amendments and vacations. 
(a)  Amendments. Once a binding site plan is recorded, any amendments from the site plan shall require the filing of an amended binding site plan. The application materials, procedures, review criteria, standards, etc., shall be the same as for the initial binding site plan. 
(b)  Vacation of a recorded binding site plan shall be approved administratively by the community development director and/or his/her designee prior to recording. 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 6, 4-20-2009)  
20.16.356 - Insignificant design deviations. 
The community development director or public works director may accept some deviations in code requirements when the binding site plan allows for viable sharing of facilities, including parking, landscaping, stormwater management, pedestrian access, and utilities. 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 7, 4-20-2009; Ord. No. 2015-025, § 2, 10-19-2015)  
20.16.360 - Final short or major subdivision plat approval process. 
(a)  The community development director shall approve or disapprove minor subdivision (short plat) final plats in accordance with the provisions of this section. The city council shall approve or disapprove, in a public meeting, major subdivision final plats in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.380 - Plat approval not acceptance of dedication offers. 
Approval of a plat does not constitute acceptance by the city of the offer of dedication of any streets, sidewalks, parks, or other public facilities shown on a plat. However, the city may accept any such offer of dedication by resolution of the council or by actually exercising control over and maintaining such facilities. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.16.390 - Protection against defects. 
(a)  Whenever (pursuant to Section 20.16.200, Authorizing Use, Occupancy, or Sale Before Completion of Development Under Special Use or Conditional Use Permits) occupancy, use or sale is allowed before the completion of all facilities or improvements intended for dedication, and a performance bond or the surety is posted pursuant to Section 20.16.200, then the applicant shall also post a maintenance bond or other sufficient surety pursuant to Part IX of Chapter 20.12 to guarantee that any defects in such improvements or facilities that appear within two years after the dedication of such facilities or improvements is accepted shall be corrected by the developer. 
(b)  Whenever all public facilities or improvements intended for dedication are installed before occupancy, use, or sale is authorized, then the developer shall post a maintenance bond or other sufficient surety pursuant to Section 20.12.830 (Maintenance Securities) to guarantee that he will correct all defects in such facilities or improvements that occur within two years after the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements is accepted. 
(c)  An architect or engineer retained by the developer shall certify to the city that all facilities and improvements to be dedicated to the city have been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this article. This certification shall be a condition precedent to acceptance by the city of the offer of dedication of such facilities or improvements. 
(d)  For purposes of this section, the term "defects" refers to any condition in publicly dedicated facilities or improvements that requires the city to make repairs in such facilities over and above the normal amount of maintenance that they would require. If such defects appear, the guaranty may be enforced regardless of whether the facilities or improvements were constructed in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.400 - Maintenance of dedicated areas until acceptance. 
As provided in Section 20.16.290 (Maintenance of Common Areas, Improvements, and Facilities), all facilities and improvements with respect to which the owner makes an offer of dedication to public use shall be maintained by the owner until the appropriate public authority accepts such offer of dedication. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.410 - Judicial review of final plats. 
The action of the city in granting or denying a final plat may be reviewed for unlawful, arbitrary, capricious or corrupt action in Snohomish County Superior Court. The petition for review must be filed within twenty-one calendar days of the final decision of the city on the final plat. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.16.420 - Alteration of recorded final plats or short plats. 
(a)  A recorded final plat or short plat may be altered, including the reconfiguration of any element graphically portrayed on a recorded final plat or the alteration of conditions, restrictions, easements, or other textual materials on the plat or with a recorded final plat. However, any change where an additional lot(s) is proposed shall not be considered a plat alteration and shall be processed as a new plat or short plat. 
(b)  The plat alteration provisions do not apply to corrections to recorded final plats or revisions to lot boundaries authorized pursuant to the boundary line adjustment provisions of Section 20.16.344 (Boundary Line Adjustments), 
(c)  In addition to the application requirements of Section 20.16.040 (Applications To Be Complete), an application for a plat alteration shall contain: 
(1)  The signatures of a majority of those persons having an ownership interest in lots, tracts, parcels, sites, or divisions in the plat or portion to be altered. 
(2)  A certificate of title showing the names of all persons who would be affected by the proposed alteration, as well as any easements or other encumbrances on the property subject to the proposed alteration. 
(3)  If the alteration proposes to change the recorded plat, a drawing prepared at the same scale as the recorded plat shall be submitted showing the details of the proposed alteration. 
(4)  If the alteration proposes a change to restrictions, conditions, or easements of a textual nature not depicted on the plat, a clearly written textual revision shall be submitted. 
(5)  A written statement of why the alteration is being requested and how the public interest would be served by its approval shall be submitted. 
(d)  Applications for plat alterations shall be processed in the same manner as special use permits, as specified in Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits), including the noticing requirement; except that notices shall also be provided to each property owner within the plat. 
(e)  The decision-making authority may approve a plat or short plat alteration if the application is found to be consistent with all applicable regulations. 
(f)  If testimony is presented and it is found that the proposed plat alteration would violate any restrictive covenants of the plat, the decision-making authority may deny the request unless such covenants are legally terminated or altered so as to accomplish the purpose of the alteration of the plat or portion thereof. 
(g)  Upon approval of a plat alteration the applicant shall produce a revised drawing and any other documents required to show the authorized changes to the final plat. The revised final plat shall bear the seal of a registered professional land surveyor, shall include the contents of a final plat, and shall be processed and recorded in the same manner as set forth for final plats. All persons with an ownership or security interest in the property to be altered must sign the altered plat prior to recording. 
(h)  Altered plats shall change, alter, or supersede the original plat only in the specific ways approved and set forth in the recorded documents.

The hearing body shall schedule and hold a closed record appeal hearing within 60 days of the date of filing of the appeal, unless all parties to the appeal agree in writing to extend the time period. 
(d)  An appeal stays all actions by the city seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the community development director certifies to the appeal body that (because of facts stated in the certificate) a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by order of the appeal body or a court, issued on application of the party seeking the stay, for due cause shown, after notice to the community development director. 
(e)  The appeal body may reverse or affirm (wholly or partly) or may modify the order, requirement or decision or determination appealed from and shall make any order, requirement, decision or determination that in its opinion ought to be made in the case before it. To this end, the appeal body shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.

(b)  Upon motion for reconsideration, the date of the decision is the date of entry of the decision on the reconsideration motion by the hearing examiner and not the original decision date by the city. 
(c)  Notice of the appeal and any other pleadings required to be filed with the court shall be served as required by law within the applicable time period. This requirement is jurisdictional. 
(d)  The cost of transcribing and preparing all records ordered certified by the court or desired by the appellant for such appeal shall be borne by the appellant.

20.20.030 - Variances. 
(a)  A development proposal may vary only from the development standards of this code or any administratively adopted guidelines.

(b)  An application for a variance shall be submitted to the city by filing a copy of the application with the planning department. Applications for variances alone or in connection with a zoning or special use permit shall be processed concurrently with the other necessary permit and in the same manner as applications for special use permits in conformity with the provisions of Chapter 20.16 (Permits and Final Plat Approval), specifically (but not exclusively) the noticing requirements of Section 20.16.120 (Notice of Application Filed) and Section 20.16.140 (Special Use Permits and Conditional Use Permits).

(c)  A variance may be granted by the community development director or hearing examiner, whichever is the appropriate permit-issuing authority per Subsection (b), if it is concluded that strict enforcement of the code would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships for the applicant and that, by granting the variance, the spirit of the code will be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. These conclusions may be reached if it is found that: 
(1)  The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property on behalf of which the application was filed is located; and 
(2)  That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located; and 
(3)  That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated. 
(d)  In granting variances, the permit-issuing authority may impose such reasonable conditions as will ensure that the use of the property to which the variance applies will be as compatible as practicable with the surrounding properties. 
(e)  A variance may be issued for an indefinite duration or for a specified duration only. 
(f)  Prior to issuance, the nature of the variance and any conditions attached to it shall be entered on the face of the permit, or the permit may simply note the issuance of the variance and refer to the written record of the variance for further information. All such conditions are enforceable in the same manner as any other applicable requirement of this title.

(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of alleys, streets, highways, streams, or railroads shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, city limits or extraterritorial boundary lines shall be construed as following such lines, limits or boundaries. 
(3)  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow the mean high-water mark of such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as following the mean high-water mark of such shorelines. 
(4)  Where a district boundary divides a lot or where distances are not specifically indicated on the official zoning map, the boundary shall be determined by measurement, using the scale of the official zoning map. Each portion of a property split zoned shall be governed Section 20.08.020 (Lots Divided by District Lines)

(Ord. No. 1365, § 11, 6-13-2005; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.28.040 - Penalties and remedies for violations.

(Ord. No. 1365, § 12, 6-13-2005; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.28.050 - Permit revocation. 
(a)  A zoning, sign, special use, or conditional use permit may be revoked by the permit-issuing authority (in accordance with the provisions of this section) if the permit recipient fails to develop or maintain the property in accordance with the plans submitted, the requirements of this title, or any additional requirements lawfully imposed by the permit-issuing authority.

(Ord. No. 1392, § 6, 2006; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
Chapter 20.32 - NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS 
 
20.32.010 - Continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided in this title and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in Section 20.32.020 (Nonconforming Lots) through Section 20.32.070 (Completion of Nonconforming Projects), nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this title may be continued. 
(b)  Nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.32.070 (Completion of Nonconforming Projects). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.32.020 - Nonconforming lots. 
(a)  This section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots. A lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. A change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with Section 20.32.050 (Change in Use of Property Where a Nonconforming Situation Exists). 
(b)  When a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use, except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in Section 20.48.010 (Minimum Lot Size Requirements), then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming. However, no use (e.g., a two-family residence) that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot. 
(c)  When the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements (Section 20.48.040, Building Setback Requirements) cannot reasonably be complied with, then the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that: 
(1)  The property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations, 
(2)  These deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot, and 
(3)  The property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety. 
(d)  For purposes of Subsection (c), compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements. However, that an applicant is facing financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(Ord. 1411 § 2, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.32.030 - Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations. 
(a)  Except as specifically provided in this section, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in: 
(1)  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use, or 
(2)  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements. 
(b)  Subject to Subsection (d), a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this title, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, subject to Section 20.32.070 (Completion of Nonconforming Projects), a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building. 
(c)  Subject to Section 20.32.070 (Completion of Nonconforming Projects), a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming, except that a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot (e.g., a sand pit) may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this title and where the proposed expansion conforms to all applicable federal, state, and local regulations concerning the use. 
(d)  The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this section occur. 
(e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), any structure used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements. This paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in Section 20.32.060 (Abandonment and Discontinuance of Nonconforming Situations). 
(f)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), whenever: (i) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it, and (ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (iii) the parking or loading requirements of Chapter 20.72 that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading, then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation. However, the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land, and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with Section 20.32.070 (Completion of Nonconforming Projects) if: (i) parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required; and (ii) such satellite parking is reasonably available. If such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditional use permit is granted, then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available. This requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit.  
20.32.040 - Repair, maintenance and reconstruction. 
(a)  Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged. Major renovation, i.e., work estimated to cost more than twenty-five percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated since the time it became nonconforming, may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. 
(b)  If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed fifty percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to structures used for single-family residential purposes, which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in Subsection 20.32.030(e) (Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations). 
(c)  For purposes of Subsections (a) and (b): 
(1)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement. 
(2)  The "cost" of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of Subsections (a) or (b) by doing such work incrementally. 
(3)  The "appraised valuation" shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser. 
(d)  The community development director shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that, in completing the renovation, repair or replacement work: 
(1)  No violation of Section 20.32.030 (Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations) will occur, and 
(2)  The permittee will comply, to the extent reasonably possible, with all provisions of this title applicable to the existing use (except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use). 
Compliance with a requirement of this title is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. That an applicant is facing financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.32.050 - Change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists. 
(a)  A change in use of property (where a nonconforming situation exists) that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning, special use, or conditional use permit in accordance with Section 20.16.010 (Permits Required) may not be made except in accordance with Subsections (b) through (d). However, this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed. 
(b)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, and all of the other requirements of this title applicable to that use can be complied with, permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot. Once conformity with this title is achieved, the property may not revert to its nonconforming status. 
(c)  If the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located, but all of the requirements of this title applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with, then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this title to issue a permit for that particular use (the community development director or hearing examiner) issues a permit authorizing the change. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds, in addition to any other findings that may be required by this title, that: 
(1)  The intended change will not result in a violation of Section 20.32.030 (Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations), and 
(2)  All of the applicable requirements of this title that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with. Compliance with a requirement of this title is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation. That an applicant is facing financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible. And in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created. 
(d)  If the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming, then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this title to issue a permit for that particular use (community development director, hearing examiner, or city council) issues a permit authorizing the change. The permit-issuing authority may issue the permit if it finds, in addition to other findings that may be required by this title, that: 
(1)  The use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning, special use, or conditional use permit, and 
(2)  All of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in Subsection (c) of this section are satisfied, and 
(3)  The proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.32.060 - Abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations. 
(a)  When a nonconforming use is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes. 
(b)  If the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is (i) discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty days, or (ii) discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations. This permit may be issued if the permit-issuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible (i.e., cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation). The permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected. 
(c)  For purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section, all of the buildings, activities, and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole. For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for one hundred eighty days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained. But if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use, discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter. 
(d)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this title is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this title, the one hundred eighty-day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this title. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.32.070 - Completion of nonconforming projects. 
All nonconforming projects on which construction was begun before the effective date of this title may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
Chapter 20.36 - ZONING DISTRICTS AND ZONING MAP  
Part I. - Zoning Districts 
 
20.36.010 - Residential districts established. 
(a)  The following residential districts are hereby established: suburban residential (SR), residential moderate density (R-MD), residential high density (R-HD), and Old Town residential (OTR). Each of these districts is designed and intended to secure for the persons who reside there a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant environment in which to live, sheltered from incompatible and disruptive activities that properly belong in nonresidential districts. Other objectives of some of these districts are explained in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The residential moderate density (R-MD) district is designed primarily to accommodate detached or attached single-family residential uses at medium densities and recreational, quasi-public, and public uses that customarily serve residential development in areas served by public sewer and water facilities. Some types of two-family residences are allowed in this district on larger lots. 
(c)  Residential high density (R-HD) district is designed primarily to accommodate higher density multi-family developments and recreational, quasi-public, and public uses that customarily serve residential development in areas served by public sewer and water facilities. 
(d)  The Old Town (OT) district is designed primarily to single-family residential development while preserving the historic quality of the traditional town center. Further, this zone is intended to promote residential development that is in character with the older, existing homes in the area. 
(e)  The suburban residential (SR) district is designed primarily to accommodate detached single-family residential development and recreational, quasi-public, and public uses that customarily serve residential development in areas served by public sewer and water facilities. Some types of two-family residences are allowed in this district on larger lots. 
(Ord. 1393 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1, 12-18-2017)  
20.36.020 - Commercial districts established. 
(a)  The following commercial districts are hereby established: neighborhood commercial (NC), Old Town business district (CBD), general commercial (GC), highway commercial (HC), and business park (BP). These districts are created to accomplish the purposes and serve the objectives set forth in the remainder of this section. 
(b)  The neighborhood commercial (NC) zone is designed to accommodate commercial activities that would meet the daily convenience needs of people residing or working in the environs. 
(c)  The Old Town business district (CBD) zone is designed to accommodate a mix of a wide variety of commercial activities and high density residential uses in a pedestrian-oriented environment. 
(d)  The general commercial (GC) zone is designed to accommodate commercial uses generally similar, though more intensive, to the types permissible in an Old Town business district. However, it is intended that this zone be placed along arterials to cater to commuters or as a transition in some areas between a highway commercial zone and a residential zone. 
(e)  The highway commercial (HC) zone is designed to accommodate the widest range of commercial activities. Uses allowed here include those allowed in other commercial districts, but also those that require highway access or that should be separated from residential uses. 
(f)  The business park (BP) zone is designed to promote and accommodate office, high technology research and development, and related uses in a park-like, master-planned setting. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1, 12-18-2017)  
20.36.030 - Manufacturing districts established. 
The general industrial (GI) and light industrial (LI) districts are hereby established primarily to accommodate enterprises engaged in the manufacturing, processing, creating, repairing, renovating, painting, cleaning, or assembling of goods, merchandise, or equipment. The performance standards set forth in Part I of Chapter 20.44 place limitations on the characteristics of uses located in these districts. The light industrial district is distinguished from the general industrial district in that the light industrial district is intended to be a cleaner, more business park-like area, whereas the general industrial district allows more resource-based manufacturing has a greater tolerance of the nuisances that typically accompany such manufacturing. Furthermore, the limitations in the light industrial district are more restrictive than those in the general industrial district.

(Ord. No. 2017-022, § 1, 12-18-2017)  
20.36.080 - Mixed use overlay district established. 
The mixed use overlay district is hereby established as an "overlay" district, meaning that the underlying zoning applicable within each commercial zone remains as the primary or principle zoning designation. The overlay allows for a mix of diversified residential development to co-exist within a proportionate share of the commercially zoned areas of highway commercial (HC), general commercial (GC), and neighborhood commercial (NC) zones where typical retail and other support services would be located, thus creating a walkable neighborhood concept. The mixed use overlay will also be applied to the residential moderate density (RMD) and residential high density (RHD) zones along the Smokey Point Boulevard corridor. The overlay will provide for the efficient use of property by requiring the mixed use of properties in a manner that allows for residential development to co-exist with commercial, retail and specific light manufacturing uses. This promotes the creation of attractive, sustainable neighborhoods which enable walkability and less automobile dependency. The performance standards/design guidelines set forth in Chapter 20.110 place limitations on the characteristics of uses located in these districts.

Such nonconforming uses are generally exempt from this chapter, except as may be compelled by state or federal regulations or it loses its nonconforming status pursuant to the regulations of Chapter 20.32. Nonconforming uses may be maintained, repaired, or reconstructed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 20.32. 
(5)  Other Uses. Other uses may be exempt when determined by the airport manager and/or airport commission to be minor or incidental in nature and consistent with the intent of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1388 § 2(part), 2006)  
20.38.060 - Airport protection district boundaries. 
In order to carry out the purposes and intent of the AP district as set forth herein, and also to restrict those uses that may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating within the airport protection district, there are hereby created and established the following airport protection district and subdistricts, based on the air space and land use safety surfaces for Arlington Municipal Airport. These subdistricts comprise the AP district and are shown on the official zoning map. 
(1)  Airport Protection Subdistrict A is comprised of the following Airport Safety Zones: 
(A)  Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) Zone 1: The RPZ boundary is trapezoidal in shape and centered about the extended runway centerline. It begins two hundred feet beyond the future end of the area usable for takeoff or landing (i.e. runway threshold). The RPZ dimensions are a function of the type of aircraft operating at the airport and the approach visibility minimums associated with each runway end. Based on the potential instrument approach improvements that are recommended in the Airport Layout Plan Update, larger future RPZ boundaries have been identified. The future Runway 16 RPZ may be described as being one thousand feet at the inner width, one thousand five hundred ten feet at the outer width, and one thousand seven hundred feet in length, with the Runway 34 RPZ boundary being 1,000 x 1,750 x 2,500 respectively. In addition, both Runways 11/29 and 8/26 RPZ boundaries may be described as two hundred fifty feet at the inner width, four hundred fifty feet at the outer width, and one thousand feet in length. 
(B)  Inner Safety Zone (ISZ) Zone 2: a rectangular area that is positioned on the extended runway centerline, and adjacent to the RPZ boundary defines the ISZ boundary. For Runway 16 the ISZ is one thousand five hundred feet wide overall (extending seven hundred fifty feet laterally from the runway centerline) and extends approximately two thousand one hundred feet beyond the RPZ boundary. For Runway 34 the ISZ is one thousand five hundred feet wide overall (extending seven hundred fifty feet laterally from the runway centerline) and extends approximately three thousand three hundred feet beyond the RPZ boundary. For Runway 11/29, the ISZ is one thousand feet wide overall (extending five hundred feet laterally from the runway centerline) and the ISZ outer boundary is defined by swinging an arc with a radius of three thousand feet that is on the runway centerline one thousand feet inward from the runway threshold. 
(C)  Inner Turning Zone (ITZ) Zone 3: The ITZ boundary is defined by a triangular shaped area that is positioned along each side of the RPZ and ISZ boundaries. For Runway 16, the ITZ extends approximately five thousand feet from a point that is on the runway centerline one thousand five hundred feet inward from the future runway threshold, within a 30-degree sector of the extended runway centerline. For Runway 34 the ITZ extends approximately six thousand feet from a point that is on the runway centerline two thousand feet inward from the runway threshold, within a twenty-degree sector of the extended runway centerline. For Runway 11/29, the ITZ extends approximately three thousand feet from a point that is on the runway centerline one thousand feet inward from the runway threshold, within a thirty-degree sector of the extended runway centerline. 
(D)  Outer Safety Zone (OSZ) Zone 4: A rectangular area that is also centered on the runway defines the OSZ boundary. For Runway 16 the OSZ is one thousand feet wide overall (extending five hundred feet laterally from the runway centerline) and extends approximately three thousand feet beyond the ISZ. For Runway 34 the OSZ is one thousand feet wide overall (extending five feet laterally from the runway centerline) and extends approximately four thousand feet beyond the ISZ. For Runway 11/29, the OSZ is one thousand feet wide overall (extending five hundred feet laterally from the runway centerline) and extends approximately one thousand five hundred feet beyond the ISZ. 
(E)  Sideline Safety Zone (SSZ) Zone 5: For Runway 16/34, the SSZ boundary is defined by a one thousand foot centerline offset on each side of the runway that connects the ITZs on each end of the runway. For Runway 11/29, the SSZ boundary is defined by a five hundred-foot centerline offset on each side of the runway that connects the ITZs on each end of the runway. For the Ultralight/Sport Runway 8/26, the SSZ boundary is defined by a four hundred-foot centerline offset on each side of the runway that connects the ITZs on each end of the runway. 
(2)  Airport Protection Subdistrict B is based on the Arlington Municipal Airport's traffic pattern. The area on the west side of the airport is defined by connecting the outermost and western points of Runway 16/34 Inner Turning Zones 3 with an arc that is tangent to a line centered on Smokey Point Boulevard. The area on the east side of the airport is defined by continuing the arcs of Inner Turning Zones 3 east of Runway 16/34 to a point where they meet a line centered on 63 rd Avenue NE. A line centered on 63 rd Avenue NE then connects the ends of the two arcs. 
(3)  Airport Protection Subdistrict C is based on the FAA AC 150/5200-33A guidelines for the type of aircraft operating at Arlington Municipal Airport. The distance recommended by the AC for an airport that serves turbine aircraft is ten thousand feet from Aircraft Operation Areas (AOA). This boundary coincides with the outer boundary of the transitional surface and the inner boundary of the conical surface. 
(4)  Airport Protection Subdistrict D is comprised of the following Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Parts 77 Imaginary Surfaces: 
(A)  Primary Surfaces: A surface that is longitudinally centered on the runway, extending two hundred feet beyond the paved threshold in each direction. Runway 16-34's ultimate primary surface measures one thousand feet across because it is to become a precision instrument runway. Runway 11-29's ultimate primary surface measures two hundred fifty feet across since it is to remain a utility runway with only visual approaches. 
(B)  Approach Surface: Inclined planes extending upward and outward from the ends of the primary surfaces. The approach for Runway 16 has been established in support of a future non-precision instrument approach with visibility minimums greater than ¾ of a mile. The approach for Runway 34 has been established in support of a future precision instrument approach with visibility minimums lower than ¾ of a mile. As specified in FAR Part 77, Runway 16's future approach surface will be one thousand feet wide at the intersection with the primary surface, will extend outward for a distance of ten thousand feet at a slope of 34:1, and will reach an outer width of three thousand five hundred feet. The future approach surface for Runway 34 will extend outward for a distance of ten thousand feet at a slope of 50:1 and another forty thousand feet at a slope of 40:1. The approach surface will reach an outer width of sixteen thousand feet wide at fifty thousand feet. Runway 11-29's approach surfaces are the same at both runway ends. The approach surfaces are two hundred fifty feet across at the primary surface and extend outward for a distance of 5,000 feet at a 20:1 slope to an outer width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet. 
(C)  Horizontal Surface: A horizontal plane one hundred fifty feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of five thousand feet radii from the center of each Primary Surface of Runway 16/34. Tangents then connect the adjacent arcs. 
(D)  Transitional Surfaces: An inclined plane with a slope of 7:1 extending upward and outward from the primary and approach surfaces, terminating at the point where they intersect with the horizontal surface or any surface with more critical restriction. 
(E)  Conical Surfaces: A surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to 1 for a horizontal distance of four thousand feet.

(2)  No use, building or structure shall emit emissions of fly ash, dust, vapor, gases, or other forms of emissions that may conflict with any planned operations of the airport. 
(3)  Except as necessary and incidental to airport operations and as listed in Subsection 4, no buildings, structures or objects of natural growth shall be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow so as to project or otherwise penetrate the airspace surfaces. 
(4)  In the areas to the east, southeast and southwest of the airport where the natural terrain rises, the acceptable height and avigation easement will be based on the height of tallest tree native to the area as depicted in USDA, Soil Conservation Service, Soil Survey of Snohomish County Area, Washington, July 1983. The native tree identified is Douglas Fir with a maximum height of one hundred sixty-six feet. 
(5)  No structure or other object shall penetrate the FAR Part 77 Surfaces unless such structure or object would be shielded by existing structures of a permanent and substantial character or by natural terrain or topographic features of equal or greater height and would be located in an area of established development where it is evident beyond all reasonable doubt that the structure so shielded will not adversely affect safety in air navigation or penetrate the FAR Part 77 Surfaces. 
(6)  Other uses or activities determined to be incompatible with aviation, aviation safety, or any activity that has a potential or would require a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) or interfere with airport traffic patterns and operations shall be prohibited.

(Ord. No. 1452, 9-26-2008)  
20.39.010 - Development standards defined. 
For purposes of this chapter, the term "development standards" means and includes, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Project elements such as permitted uses, residential densities, and nonresidential densities and intensities or building sizes; 
(2)  The amount and payment of impact fees imposed or agreed to in accordance with any applicable provisions of state law, any reimbursement provisions, other financial contributions by the property owner, application fees, administrative charges, inspection fees, drafting fees, or dedications;

20.39.020 - Development standards—Flexibility. 
A development agreement shall be consistent with applicable development regulations to the fullest extent possible; provided, a development agreement may allow development standards different from those otherwise imposed under the Arlington Municipal Code in order to provide flexibility to achieve public benefits, respond to changing community needs, or encourage modifications which provide the functional equivalent or adequately achieve the purposes of otherwise applicable city standards. Any approved development standards that differ from those in the code shall not require any further zoning reclassification, variance from city standards or other city approval apart from development agreement approval, except that no deviation from airport protection district regulations or critical areas regulations shall be permitted. The development standards as approved through a development agreement shall apply to and govern the development and implementation of each covered site in lieu of any conflicting or different standards or requirements elsewhere in the Arlington Municipal Code. Subsequently adopted standards which differ from those of a development agreement adopted by the city as provided in this chapter shall apply to the covered development project only where necessary to address imminent public health and safety hazards or where the development agreement specifies a time period or phase after which certain identified standards can be modified. Determination of the appropriate standards for future phases which are not fully defined during the initial approval process may be postponed. Building permit applications shall be subject to the building codes in effect when the permit is applied for.

(Ord. No. 1452, 9-26-2008)  
Chapter 20.40 - PERMISSIBLE USES 
 
20.40.010 - Table of permissible uses. 
Table 20.40-1, the Table of Permissible Uses sets forth the permissible uses within the respective zoning classifications in the city, subject to other applicable provisions in this title. It should be read in close conjunction with the definitions of terms set forth in Section 20.08.010 (definitions of basic terms) and the other interpretative provisions set forth in this article. 
(Ord. 1388 § 3, 2006; Ord. 1363 § 3, 2005; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2013-010, § 3, 8-5-2013; Ord. No. 2014-002, § 3, 2-3-2014; Ord. No. 2015-021, § 2, 10-5-2015)  
20.40.020 - Use of the designations Z, S, C in table of permissible uses. 
(a)  Subject to Section 20.40.030 (community development director jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit), when used in connection with a particular use in the table of permissible uses (Section 20.40.010), the letter "P" means that the use is permissible with a valid city business license. The letters "ZV" mean that the use is permissible with a zoning verification approval. The letters ACUP mean that the use is permissible with an administrative conditional use permit. The letter "Z" means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the community development director. The letter "S" means a special use permit must be obtained from the community development director or hearing examiner, and the letter "C" means a conditional use permit must be obtained from the hearing examiner. 
(b)  When used in connection with residential uses (use classification 1.000), the designation "ZSC" means that such developments of less than twenty dwelling units must be pursuant to a zoning permit, developments of twenty or more but less than fifty dwelling units need a special use permit, and developments of fifty or more dwelling units require a conditional use permit. 
(c)  When used in connection with nonresidential uses, the designation "ZS" or "ZC" means that such developments require a zoning permit if the total area to be developed is less than four acres in size, and a special or conditional use permit, respectively, if the total area is four acres or larger in area. The area to be developed shall be measured using a rectangular perimeter enclosing the full extent of the on-site development, including any development that may be necessary to meet the requirements of this title. If development occurs in succession over time, then a special or conditional use permit shall be required at the point when the entire developed or developing area surpasses four acres. 
(d)  Use of the designation ZSC for combination uses is explained in Section 20.40.080 (Combination Uses). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2015-021, § 3, 10-5-2015)  
20.40.030 - Community development director jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever the Table of Permissible Uses (interpreted in the light of Section 20.40.020 (Use of the Designations Z, S, C in Table of Permissible Uses) and the other provisions of this chapter) provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit, a special use permit shall nevertheless be required if the community development director finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public. In making this determination, the community development director shall consider, among other factors, whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot, whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another, whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties, and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.40.040 - Permissible uses and specific exclusions. 
(a)  The presumption established by this title is that all legitimate uses of land are addressed within the Table of Permissible Uses, and are either allowed or not allowed thereby. But because the list of permissible uses set forth in Section 20.40.010 (Table of Permissible Uses) cannot be all-inclusive, those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (a), all distinct uses that are not listed in Section 20.40.010 (Table of Permissible Uses), even given the liberal interpretation mandated by Subsection (a), are prohibited. Nor shall Section 20.40.010 (Table of Permissible Uses) be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts. Similarly, all uses listed but left blank under the zone compatibility columns are prohibited. 
(c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions, the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts: 
(1)  Any use that involves the manufacture, handling, sale, distribution, or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the city's fire prevention code. 
(2)  Stockyards, slaughterhouses, rendering plants. 
(3)  Use of a travel trailer, motor home, or other recreational vehicle as a permanent residence. (Temporary residence is permitted under certain conditions pursuant to Section 20.44.044, Recreational Vehicles as Temporary Dwelling Units). 
(4)  Use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold or stored, any services are performed, or other business is conducted. This prohibition does not apply to temporary public services, such as bookmobiles, blood donation centers, public service information, etc. (Situations that do not comply with this subsection on the effective date of this title are required to conform within thirty days.) 
(5)  The following activities, including any similar activities, are prohibited as home occupations in all zones: marijuana production, marijuana processing, and marijuana retail. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2014-002, § 4, 2-3-2014)  
20.40.050 - Accessory uses. 
(a)  The table of permissible uses (Section 20.40.010) classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts. Whenever an activity (which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table) is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use (i) constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot, or (ii) is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it, then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use. 
(b)  For purposes of interpreting Subsection (a): 
(1)  A use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use, 
(2)  To be "commonly associated" with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not, but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness. 
(c)  Without limiting the generality of Subsections (a) and (b), the following activities, so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above, are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses: 
(1)  Offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot (or lots where the principal use occupies more than one lot) as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities of a commercial nature, so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation. 
(2)  Hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature. 
(3)  The renting out of one or two rooms within a single-family residence (which one or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit) other than on a daily or weekly basis to not more than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the single-family dwelling. 
(4)  Yard sales or garage sales, so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot (or lots where the principal use occupies more than one lot) for more than three days (whether consecutive or not) during any ninety-day period. 
(d)  Without limiting the generality of Subsections (a) and (b), the following activities shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and are prohibited in residential districts. 
(1)  Abandoned vehicles as regulated by AMC Chapter 9.92 (Abandoned Vehicles). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2015-021, § 4, 10-5-2015)  
20.40.060 - Permissible uses not requiring land use permits. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, no zoning, special use, or conditional use permit is necessary for the following uses: 
(1)  Electric power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, gas, water, and sewer lines, wires or pipes, together with supporting poles or structures, located within a public right-of-way. 
(2)  Neighborhood, but not regional, utility facilities located within a public right-of-way with the permission of the owner (state or city) of the right-of-way. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2015-021, § 5, 10-5-2015)  
20.40.070 - Change in use. 
(a)  A substantial change in use of property occurs whenever a new use or activity conducted on a lot creates a more intensive impact to the site in question or to the infrastructure of the city than the previous use, as determined by the community development director and/or his or her designee. 
(b)  A mere change in the status of property from occupied to unoccupied or vice versa does not constitute a substantial change in use. Whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied, unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than one hundred eighty consecutive days or has been abandoned. 
(c)  A mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a substantial change in use. 
(Ord. 1411 § 32, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.40.080 - Combination uses. 
(a)  When a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits (zoning, special use, or conditional use), then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be: 
(1)  A conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit. 
(2)  A special use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special use permit but none requires a conditional use permit. 
(3)  A zoning permit in all other cases. This is indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses by the designation ZSC in each of the columns adjacent to the 29.000 classification. 
(Ord. No. 1312, 11-17-2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.40.090 - More specific use controls. 
Whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the table of permissible uses (Section 20.40.010), the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls.

Chapter 20.44 - SUPPLEMENTAL USE REGULATIONS  
Part I. - General Provisions 
 
20.44.010 - Solid waste, quarrying, mining, and similar uses. 
(a)  All permits for 14.300, 14.400, and 15.300 use classifications shall be subject to this section. 
(b)  In addition to all other submission requirements, permit applications for such uses shall be accompanied by a site reclamation plan. This plan shall contain and address the following: 
(1)  A description and site plan detailing how the site will be reclaimed. 
(2)  An analysis of how the reclaimed site will be compatible with existing and anticipated land uses and zoning. 
(3)  An analysis of how the reclaimed site will not prevent the orderly and reasonable use and development of surrounding properties or of properties in adjacent zones. 
(4)  That the proposed use and any expansion does not impair or impede the realization of the objectives of the comprehensive plan, and it would not be detrimental to the public interest to grant such proposed use. 
(5)  The timing and schedule of reclamation. 
(c)  All 14.300, 14.400, and 15.300 use classifications shall be subject to the Manufacturing/Processing Performance Standards of Part III of this chapter. 
(d)  Permits for 14.300, 14.400, and 15.300 use classifications may be limited in duration by the permit-issuing authority. In such a case, the permit shall clearly state the expiration date. The permit period shall be of sufficient duration to ensure the completion of the use for which the permit is required; however, in no instance shall the period of time be in excess of twenty years. Permit renewals shall be processed in the same manner as new applications. 
(e)  The permit-issuing authority may consider requiring a performance security in an amount deemed satisfactory to cover the costs of ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section and the terms and conditions of any permit issued under the provisions of this chapter, including required reclamation. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.44.016 - Mixed use developments. 
In all mixed-use developments (Use Classification 1.340 of the TOPU), no more than thirty-five percent of the gross floor area of the first floor may be parking or other non-commercial uses. Furthermore, such non-commercial uses shall be located away from the primary entrance of the building, with the commercial uses being prominently no ticeable from the primary entrance. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.44.020A - Unit lot subdivisions (ULSs). 
(a)  Unit lot subdivision is an alternative to conventional subdivision processes by which the location of a building on a lot can be placed in such a manner that one or more of the building's sides rests directly on a lot line, allowing for the creation of fee simple lots for townhome, and cottage housing developments, in zones where such uses are permitted. Each building shall not be less than one units or exceed ten units and shall maintain a ten-foot separation from other buildings. 
(b)  Unit lot subdivisions shall be permitted in residential high-density zones and all commercial zones (in conjunction with the horizontal mixed-use overlay). 
(c)  Prior to submittal of the final plat, the design of all buildings shall meet the design standards and shall have received design review approval. 
(d)  All units created by a unit lot subdivision shall provide attached private open space for each individual unit equaling fifteen percent of the total lot area, but in no case shall be less than two hundred square feet. The required open space may be provided by one or more of the following: ground level open space, balconies, roof decks or porches. 
(e)  Existing multi-family developments which meet or can be brought into conformance with the requirements of the unit lot subdivision may submit an application for such unit lot subdivision. The existing building shall also be in full compliance with the most currently adopted edition of the International Residential Code (IBC) and International Fire Code (IFC). 
(f)  If a development proposes open or park space exceeding one hundred twenty-five percent of the minimum requirement, buildings may exceed the maximum allowed height requirement by five feet. 
(g)  Low impact development street standards are required where feasible. 
(h)  Low impact development techniques for stormwater management are required where feasible.

(Ord. No. 2019-010, § 15, 5-6-2019)  
20.44.030 - Flexible development standards (FDSS). 
(a)  All developments using flexible development standards shall have a public hearing before the hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall review and may approve all FDSs following a neighborhood meeting per AMC Section 20.16.130, and recommendation from the design review board on the elevations and footprints of all structures. 
(b)  Flexible development standards may only be located on tracts of at least five acres within a Suburban Residential (SR), Low/Moderate Density Residential (RLMD), Moderate Density Residential (RMD), or High Density Residential (RHD) zoning district, or within a Master Planned Neighborhood (Section 20.44.032). 
(c)  The gross residential density of an FDS development shall not exceed the allowable density based on the number of dwelling units per acre. Density bonuses are expressly prohibited. Allowable densities shall be computed for an FDS development based on the gross density calculations of the given underlying zone, e.g., (RLMD) one dwelling unit per seven thousand two hundred square feet or 6.05 dwelling units per gross acre. 
(d)  Permissible types of residential uses within an FDS development include single-family detached dwellings (use classification 1.111), single-family attached (1.130), two-family residences (1.200), and multi-family residences (1.300) regardless of the underlying zone. 
(e)  In any FDS development, the developer may create lots and construct buildings with reduced lot size, width, or setback restrictions except that: 
(1)  All perimeter lots shall regardless of the underlying zone meet the minimum lot width for that zone. 
(2)  At least fifty percent of the total number of dwelling units in any FDS development must be single-family detached residences on lots with a minimum lot width of fifty feet in all zones except for the RHD zone where one hundred percent of the allowable number of dwelling units may be detached (cottage style housing) or attached residences. 
(3)  FDS developments must comply with the fire protection requirements of the most current edition as adopted by the state of Washington of the International Building Code (IBC), International Residential Code (IRC) and the International Fire Code (IFC). 
(4)  Setback requirements of the underlying zone shall apply for all property lines located on the perimeter of the FDS development. A perimeter lot shall be a lot abutting directly on an exterior property line for the entire site. 
(5)  Each lot must be of sufficient size and dimensions that it can support the structure proposed to be located on it, consistent with all other applicable requirements of this title. 
(6)  In the SR zone, lots adjacent to a critical area must have a minimum of six thousand square feet and a minimum width of fifty feet. 
(7)  Each lot must be designed so that any structure can be built a minimum of fifteen feet from any environmentally critical area buffer. LID facilities are allowed within the outer twenty-five percent of the critical areas buffer. 
(8)  The maximum lot coverage specified in Section 20.48.064 (maximum lot coverage) shall be met on an average for all lots in the entire FDS development. Thus, in calculating the average maximum lot coverage for a lot, the area of open space protected on that lot through FDSs may be used. However, the developer shall state on the plat the maximum lot coverage for each individual lot so as not to create future, unforeseen inequities. 
(9)  The design of an FDS development, including site layout, landscaping, public facilities (e.g. storm drainage, parks, streets, etc.) and building design shall be subject to recommendation from the community development staff to the hearing examiner and recommendation from the design review board regarding elevations and footprints of all structures pursuant to the city's adopted design guidelines to the hearing examiner. In lieu of the DRB approving each single- or two-family structure, the applicant may propose project specific design guidelines consisting of elevations and footprints for these types of structures only (multi-family residential and communal structures shall always be approved by the DRB as part of the FDS approval). In such a case, the project specific design guidelines shall be reviewed by the DRB for consistency with the city's design guidelines and be subject to their recommendation to the hearing examiner. The department of community development may then implement them administratively when an applicant applies for building permits. Where authority is granted by the DRB to staff to review individual single- or two-family residential structures, the DRB shall be the arbiter between the applicant and staff. 
(10)  When located in the SR, RLMD, or RMD zone, multi-family portions of an FDS development shall be situated more toward the interior rather than the periphery of the tract, or along an adjoining arterial street, so that the single-family detached residences border adjacent properties that are zoned for single-family residential uses. 
(11)  Screening requirements (Chapter 20.76) shall apply to the exterior boundaries of an FDS development but are not required between uses within an FDS development. Landscaping within LID facilities can count towards site boundary screening requirements. 
(12)  When creating an FDS development, residential subdivisions and multi-family projects, the amount of land "saved" by creating lots that are smaller than the standards set forth in Section 20.48.010 (minimum lot size requirements) shall be set aside as open space. This open space shall be a minimum of ten percent of the site and shall be improved with common amenities. The amenities can include, but are not limited to usable open space area, landscaped entries into the project (in addition to the standard roadway dedication and landscaping requirements), courtyards, landscape islands in the center of roads, additional protection of significant clusters of trees, low impact designs (rain gardens), additional improved park space, or other amenities as may be appropriate. Of the ten percent of open space required, twenty-five percent of the total may include protected sensitive areas and their buffers. The hearing examiner shall be given deference in determining what amount and mix of such amenities counts toward this requirement as long as the minimum threshold is met. In addition the applicant shall meet the comprehensive plan for open space and park land, as well as all applicable Land Use Code requirements. 
(13)  In all zones, low impact development street standards are preferred where feasible and low impact development techniques for stormwater management are required where feasible. 
(14)  The purpose of this section is to provide flexibility, consistent with the public health and safety and without increasing overall density, to the developer who subdivides property and constructs buildings on the lots created in accordance with a unified and coherent plan of development or the developer who constructs within the RHD zone.

(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 4, 10-19-2015)  
20.44.032 - Master planned neighborhood development (MPND). 
(a)  In any Master Planned Neighborhood district (Section 20.36.054, Master Planned Neighborhood Overlay District Established) no development may be permitted until the developer has prepared and received approval of a master plan for the entire area included in the MPN district. 
(b)  Since the approval of a master plan affects the zoning, and thus use of the property, said master plan shall be processed as an amendment to this title (Chapter 20.96). 
(c)  No area of less than twenty contiguous acres may be planned through a MPN approval process, and then only (i) upon the request of the owner or majority of owners of all the property intended to be covered by such an overlay zone, or (ii) by the city council in implementing the MPN land use designation pursuant to subsection (d) approval of MPNs is achieved through a rezone process. 
(d)  The MPN district shall be used on any land with a Master Planned Neighborhood land use designation as shown on the comprehensive plan land use map. If property is placed in an MPN district by the council prior to a master plan being developed (Section 20.44.032 (Master Planned Neighborhood Developments), it shall not show the individual elements until the master plan is approved. 
(e)  For areas designated Master Planned Neighborhood in the comprehensive plan, MPND approval may be sought prior to or after annexation to the city. However, in the case where MPND approval is not approved prior to or concurrent with annexation the entire annexation area shall be zoned Suburban Residential until such time that an MPND is approved. 
(f)  At a minimum the master plan shall identify: 
(1)  The locations and sizes of the districts as follows: 
A.  One element of each MPN district shall be the low-density residential element. Here there is one possibility, using the Suburban Residential district described in Section 20.36.010 (Residential Districts Established). Within that portion of the MPN zone that is developed for low-density residential purposes, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the Suburban Residential district. Within any MPND, not less than fifty percent of the total area may be developed for lower density residential (Suburban Residential) purposes. 
B.  A second element of each MPN district may be the medium to higher density residential element. Here there are three possibilities, each one corresponding either to the Residential Low/Moderate Density, the Residential Moderate Density, or the High Density Residential zoning districts described in Subsection 20.36.010(d) (Residential Districts Established). Within that portion of the MPN district that is developed for medium or higher density residential purposes, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the residential district to which the particular MPN zoning district corresponds. 
C.  A third element of each MPN district may be the commercial element. Here there is one possibility, corresponding to the Neighborhood Commercial district identified in Section 20.36.020 (Commercial Districts Established). Within that portion of a MPN district that is developed for purposes permissible in a NC district, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the NC district. 
D.  A public services/facilities element may be a fourth element of any MPN district. Here uses permitted within the Public/Semi-Public district would be permitted within the MPN district. If a P/SP element is included, then within that portion of the MPN district that is developed for purposes permissible in a P/SP district, all development must be in accordance with the regulations applicable to the P/SP district. 
(2)  The approximate locations, types, and sizes of public facilities and amenity areas (e.g., parks, schools, open space, common landscaped areas, etc); 
(3)  Conceptual infrastructure plans (e.g., location, types, and sizes of streets, sewer, water, stormwater, etc); 
(4)  Compliance with those portions of the city's development design guidelines having to do with neighborhood design pursuant to Chapter 20.46, Design; 
(5)  Public infrastructure financing strategies (including any improvements to existing on- or off-site facilities necessary to support the MPND); and 
(6)  An anticipated phasing and/or build out schedule, subject to an analysis of service capacity by the city. 
(g)  Unless the city's SEPA responsible official determines otherwise, the applicant shall develop a programmatic environmental impact statement for the MPN permit. Subsequent development permits may then rely on this EIS to the extent feasible to minimize additional SEPA review. It shall be the intent of the city that during subsequent permitting no additional SEPA review would be required for any action or impact analyzed in the programmatic EIS, unless unforeseen or extraordinary environmental issues arise. 
(h)  In a Master Planned Neighborhood Development, once the master plan is approved and zoning districts assigned per (f)(1), the developer may make use of the land for any purpose authorized in those particular districts, subject to the provisions of the master plan and this title. 
(i)  In those areas of the MPND assigned to the Suburban Residential district, lots adjacent to critical areas may be reduced in size and width to a minimum of six thousand square feet and a width of sixty feet so long as the standard of Section 20.48.030(a) (Lot Shape and Minimum Lot Widths) is met and so long as a gross density of four dwelling units per acre is not exceeded. 
(j)  As indicated in the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 20.40.010, Table of Permissible Uses), a Master Planned Neighborhood Development (use classification 30.200) is the only permissible use of a MPN district, and Master Planned Neighborhoods are permissible only in such zones. 
(k)  In approving the MPND the council may require that the MPND comply with any site specific development regulations that the city may develop.

(3)  Structures that are nonconforming with respect to height may be used for the placement of micro facilities providing they do not extend more than six feet above the existing structure. Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered to be an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
(4)  A micro facility shall be located on existing buildings, poles, or other existing support structures, but only if the interior wall or ceiling immediately adjacent to the facility is not designated residential space. 
(5)  The shelter or cabinet used to house radio electronic equipment shall be contained wholly within a building or structure, or otherwise appropriately concealed, camouflaged or located underground. 
(6)  In R-LMD, and R-MD zones, micro facilities for a specific wireless provider shall be separated by a distance of at least one thousand three hundred twenty linear feet from other wireless communications facilities. 
(7)  The facility shall also comply with the requirements of subsection (b). 
(d)  Development Standards for Mini Facilities. 
(1)  Mini facilities shall comply with Section 20.48.060 (Building height limitations) except as follows: Omni directional antennas may exceed the height limitation by ten feet, or in the case of nonconforming structures, the antennas may extend ten feet above the existing structure. Panel antennas may exceed the height limitation if affixed to the side of an existing nonconforming building and blends in architecturally with the building. Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered to be an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
(2)  A mini facility may be located on existing buildings, poles, or other existing support structures, but only if the interior wall or ceiling immediately adjacent to the facility is not designated residential space. 
(3)  The shelter or cabinet used to house radio electronic equipment shall be contained wholly within a building or structure, or otherwise appropriately concealed, camouflaged or located underground. 
(4)  The facility shall also comply with the requirements of subsection (b). 
(e)  Development Standards for Macro Facilities.

Part IV. - Cottage Housing 
 
20.44.300 - Purpose and intent 
The general purposes of the cottage housing development design standards are as follows: 
(1)  A cottage housing development is an alternative type of detached housing providing small residences for households of typically one to two individuals. Cottage housing is provided as part of the city's overall housing strategy which intends to encourage affordability, innovation and variety in housing design and site development while ensuring compatibility with existing neighborhoods, and to promote a variety of housing choices to meet the needs of a population diverse in age, income, household composition and individual needs. 
(2)  The cottage housing development design standards are intended to create a small community of cottages oriented around open space that is pedestrian-oriented and minimizes the visibility of off-street parking. These design standards are intended to ensure that cottage housing developments include pedestrian amenities and take advantage of existing natural features on the site including topography and vegetation. The cottage housing development design standards are intended to maintain traditional cottage amenities and proportions and ensure that cottage housing developments contribute to the overall community character. Because there may be alternative designs that meet the objectives of the design standards, the provisions of Sections 20.44.300 through 20.44.400 provide an alternative design review process to consider other acceptable ways to accomplish the objectives of this section. 
(3)  All cottage housing developments are subject to current city stormwater standards and shall incorporate stormwater low impact development techniques whenever possible. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.310 - Applicability, application process and design review. 
Applicability of this section, application procedure and the process for design review is pursuant to Chapter 20.46 AMC. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.320 - Density, number of cottage housing units and minimum lot area. 
See Density and Dimensional Standards for Residential Zones. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.330 - Building height. 
Structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed to be single story or single story plus a loft. Because the base density is higher and building separation less than on typical residential lots, it is important to maintain a feeling of adequate light and open space by providing more restrictive maximum roof heights and roof proportion standards. 
(1)  The maximum building height permitted for structures in cottage housing developments shall not exceed one and one-half stories or twenty-five feet in height. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.340 - Lot coverage area. 
Cottage housing developments shall not exceed underlying lot coverage standards for the respective zoning district to maintain residential neighborhood character and the balance of built structures to open spaces. 
(1)  The maximum lot coverage permitted for all structures in cottage housing developments shall not exceed the requirements for the underlying zoning. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.350 - Cottage floor area. 
Structures in cottage housing developments are primarily intended for one- and two-person households and their occasional guests. Maintaining the maximum square footage of residences in cottage housing developments is necessary to prevent overbuilding of the site and to not exceed available on and off-street parking. 
(1)  The maximum floor area for an individual structure in a cottage housing development shall not exceed one thousand two hundred square feet. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.360 - Cottage housing development building separation. 
Structures within cottage housing developments shall observe minimum setbacks from other cottage housing development structures to avoid overcrowding the site and to maintain a sense of privacy within the cottages themselves. 
(1)  All buildings within a cottage housing development shall maintain a minimum separation of ten feet from cottages within a cottage housing development measured from the nearest point of the exterior walls. Accessory buildings shall comply with building code requirements for separation from noncottage structures. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.370 - Parks and open space. 
The minimum parks and open space are intended to provide a sense of openness and visual relief in cottage housing developments. Common open space shall provide a centrally located, focal area for the cottage housing development. The common area shall be outside of stormwater, wetlands, streams and sensitive area buffers and developed and maintained so its is usable for active or passive recreation activities. Private open space shall provide area around the individual dwellings to enable diversity in landscape design. 
(1)  Parks shall meet the minimum requirements of Chapter 20.52. 
(2)  Common open space shall: 
(A)  Be a minimum of four hundred square feet per cottage; 
(B)  Abut at least fifty percent of the cottages in a cottage housing development; 
(C)  Have cottages abutting at least two sides. 
(3)  Cottages shall: 
(A)  Be oriented around and have the main entry from the common open space; 
(B)  Be within seventy-five feet of walking distance to common open space. 
(4)  Private open space shall: 
(A)  Be a minimum of three hundred square feet of private, contiguous, usable open space adjacent to each dwelling unit, for the exclusive use of the cottage resident. It shall be oriented toward the common open space as much as possible, with no dimension less than ten feet. 
(B)  Additionally, cottages shall have a roofed porch that is covered and is at least ten percent of the total square footage of the residence living space. 
(5)  At least fifty percent of all the units shall have an attached enclosure that is a minimum of forty square feet (not included in total living space square footage) which is accessible from the exterior of the building. 
(Ord. No. 1453, 9-26-2008)  
20.44.380 - Off street parking. 
Off-street parking space requirements for cottage housing developments shall be calculated at the multi-family requirement. Off-street parking shall be located and designed to be less visible from frontage streets than the cottages themselves. Off-street parking shall be designed to maintain a pedestrian character for the overall cottage housing development. Clustering parking to the side or rear of a cottage project will most often best accomplish these goals. However, on a site-specific basis, design solutions other than clustering may be found to meet this objective through the alternative design process. Parking areas shall be attractively landscaped to screen parking from adjacent properties and street rights-of-way and shall meet applicable parking lot landscape standards.

Section II. - Old Town Residential In-Fill Design Standards 
 
20.46.110 - Purpose and intent. 
Old Town is a unique district in Arlington, representing, as the name implies, the old part of town. It is laid out in a street-and-alley grid pattern, with garages and utilities predominately on the alleys. There is a predominance of older homes built in historic architectural styles, and most have front porches. Lots are small, though many of the older homes are built on parcels consisting of two or three lots, some of which are now nonconforming in terms of size or setbacks. Back at the turn of the 20th century this was common practice. 
However, with the increase in value of these lots, many property owners are selling them to builders who are building new homes that do not fit the unique historic character of Old Town. Many have caused problems with existing residents because of privacy, setback, and scale issues. 
At the same time, infill development is one of the strategies adopted through the city's comprehensive plan to meet its growth targets, but not its only strategy, and certainly not at the expense of substantially changing the character of the Old Town Business and Residential Districts. 
Thus, the intent of this part is to: 
(1)  Preserve the historic development pattern found in Old Town. 
(2)  Protect property owners' ability to sell their excess lots. 
(3)  Protect existing property values by encouraging compatible development. 
(4)  Implement a design code for Old Town that permits infill development in a manner that is acceptable to the community while retaining the elements that provide for the traditional residential and "Main Street" style of growth. 
(5)  Recognizing the mix of architectural styles that have been built over the neighborhood's one hundred plus years, it is the city's intent to promote the specific architectural styles and development patterns that are historically prevalent and characteristic of the Old Town District. 
(Ord. 1352 § 1, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 1, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003). 
(Ord. No. 2018-005, § 7, 7-2-2018)  
20.46.114 - Applicability. 
This part shall apply to all residential construction, including new construction, remodels, and additions in the Old Town District; except, that if a house is damaged, the homeowner may rebuild the structure exactly as it was. 
(Ord. 1352 § 2, 2004; Ord. 1316 § 2, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.118 - Process. 
Design review for compliance with this part shall be performed by the Community and Economic Development (CED) Director or his or her designee through the permitting process. The director shall have the authority to render interpretations of this Code and to adopt policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions. 
(Ord. 1352 § 3, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 3, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2018-005, § 8, 7-2-2018)  
20.46.122 - Deviations. 
The planning commission may grant deviations from the standards in this part only: 
(1)  If an alternative is provided that, in their opinion, meets the intent of this part; or, 
(2)  If the intent of the deviation is to preserve or protect a significant tree or trees. 
Applications for deviations shall be submitted to the CED director, who shall then forward them to the planning commission at their next available meeting. The applicant will be notified of the planning commission's decision within ten days of such decision. 
(Ord. 1352 § 4, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 4, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2018-005, § 9, 7-2-2018)  
20.46.126 - Building setbacks. 
(a)  Setbacks from Lot Boundary Lines. Setbacks of primary buildings from lot boundary lines shall be as specified in Section 20.48.040 (Building Setback Requirements); except that: 
(1)  All primary buildings shall maintain a minimum ten feet distance (measurements taken from foundations) from other buildings, including those on adjacent lots. 
(2)  However, in no case shall a primary building have a setback less than the five-foot standard setback for the zone as specified in Section 20.48.040 (Building Setback Requirements). 
(b)  Setbacks from Public Rights-of-Way. 
(1)  Front yard setbacks of buildings from public right-of-ways shall be as specified in Section 20.48.040 (Building Setback Requirements), or equal to the average of the two immediately adjacent primary buildings, whichever is less. Where averaging is used, the new building may be averaged in a stepping pattern between the front yards of the adjacent residences, or the new building's entire frontage may be built on the average setback line. The front yard is defined as being that side of the building facing the street on which the building has its primary entrance. 
(2)  On a corner lot the exterior side yard setback may be reduced to ten feet. The exterior side yard is defined as that side of the building adjacent to a public right-of-way but from which the building does not have its primary entrance. 
(Ord. 1438 § 12, 2007; Ord. 1352 § 5, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 5, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2018-005, § 10, 7-2-2018)  
20.46.138 - Building materials. 
(a)  The primary materials for the exterior of buildings shall be: siding, cement board or natural wood, stucco, board and batten style (battens over panel siding), real or cultured masonry materials, or wood shingles. Accent materials shall include real or cultured masonry materials, horizontal siding and wood shingles. 
(b)  Exterior building materials shall not include the following: panel siding (except as specified in subsection (c)), non-architecturally treated concrete block, or non- architecturally treated tilt-up concrete panels, corrugated metal siding, or standard single or double tee concrete systems. Metal siding may be used as an accent material, but not as a primary material. 
(c)  When panel siding is used, battens with a twenty-four inch maximum spacing shall be used for a board and batt appearance. 
(d)  Wood trim shall have a minimum dimension of one inch by three inches. 
(e)  All sides of the building must be compliant with the design standards, not just those facing streets. 
(f)  Corner Lots. Buildings on corner lots face special circumstances. All sides with street frontages shall be treated with the same quality of materials and similar architectural detailing as the front and shall be visually appealing like the front. Examples to create appealing street-facing facades include adding a feature that makes an architectural statement, such as bay windows, and areas of decorative brick, wrap around porches or other attractive features, etc. 
(Ord. 1352 § 8, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 8, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003). 
(Ord. No. 2018-005, § 11, 7-2-2018)  
20.46.142 - Articulation, modulation, massing and scale. 
(a)  All buildings shall provide a variation in the façade through use of building modulation and floor area offsets from the main construction. 
(b)  Fronts of buildings shall be articulated through the use of bays, insets, balconies, porches, or stoops related to entrances and windows. 
(c)  All buildings shall be designed to provide complex massing configurations with a variety of different wall planes. At least every twenty-four linear feet, street-side wall planes shall contain offsets or setbacks with a differential in horizontal plane of at least six inches. Bay windows, cantilevers, and other similar protrusions can account for such offsets. 
(d)  Building design shall incorporate visually heavier and more massive elements at the building base, and lighter elements above the base. A second story, for example, should not appear heavier or demonstrate greater mass than that portion of the building supporting it. 
(e)  In addition, for corner lots see Section 20.46.138 (Building Materials). 
(Ord. 1352 § 9, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 9, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.146 - Roofs. 
(a)  Roof design treatments shall meet the following development criteria: 
(1)  Roofs may have dormers, gables, or similar variations in roof planes in order to break up the roof mass. 
(2)  Individual roofs may include a variety of colors and materials, including tile, composition, shake and shingle. 
(3)  Predominant roof materials shall be material such as, but not limited to: wood shake shingles, clay or concrete tiles, or composition wood and asphalt shingles. Flat or corrugated metal or flat built-up roofs are prohibited. Standing seam baked enamel steel roofing material are allowed. 
(Ord. 1352 § 10, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 10, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2018-005, § 12, 7-2-2018)  
20.46.150 - Building orientation, entries and porches. 
(a)  Either a recessed entry or porch shall be incorporated into the design, whichever is most predominant among the existing dwellings along the street on which the dwelling is proposed. 
(b)  A front porch or covered entry shall be a minimum of six feet deep in order to accommodate outdoor seating. 
(c)  If a porch is not included at the main entrance, a covered entry that provides an area to wait at the front door out of the weather shall be included. 
(Ord. 1352 § 11, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 11, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.166 - Additions. 
In planning an addition it is important to pay careful attention to the architectural style of the existing residence. In many cases, additions can dramatically change the appearance of the residence and, therefore, the character of the neighborhood. Therefore, for additions, in addition to all the previous rules, the following apply: 
(1)  The scale and mass of the addition must be in keeping with that of the original building. 
(2)  The location of additions shall not disrupt established setbacks of neighboring structures. 
(3)  The addition's roof shall match or complement the design of the original building. 
(4)  Architectural elements such as windows shall respect the prevailing geometry of the original building. For instance, windows with a vertical orientation can be incompatible with those of a horizontal orientation. 
(5)  The materials used for the addition shall match or coordinate with those of the original building. 
(Ord. 1352 § 15, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 15, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.174 - Vents and downspouts. 
Roof flashing, rain gutters, downspouts, vents and other roof protrusions shall be finished to match the adjacent materials and/or colors. 
(Ord. 1352 § 17, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 17, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.178 - Equipment screening. 
Any equipment, whether on the roof, side of building or ground, must be screened. The method of screening must be architecturally compatible with the building in terms of materials, color, shape and size. The screening design shall blend with the building design. Where several individual pieces of equipment are provided a continuous screen is required. 
(Ord. 1352 § 18, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 18, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.182 - Accessory buildings. 
The design of accessory buildings that require a building permit shall be architecturally compatible with the main building through the use of walls/roofs/trellises, fence/wall connections and/or landscaping. 
(Ord. 1352 § 19, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 19, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.46.186 - Walls and fences. 
Walls and fences are an integral part of the streetscape. 
(1)  Walls intended to screen shall be of plaster or smooth stucco finish or other approved masonry. They shall be designed in a style, materials and color to complement the dwelling units to which they are attached. Other materials may include wrought iron, tile insets or grillwork. 
(2)  Wall and fence heights are governed by Section 20.48.040 (Building Setback Requirements). 
(3)  Both sides of all perimeter walls or fences shall be architecturally treated. 
(Ord. 1352 § 20, 2004: Ord. 1316 § 20, 2004: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).

(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.48.020 - Residential density. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (b) and the provisions of Section 20.48.094 (Density on Lots Created Through Short Subdivision Where Portion Dedicated to City for Right-of-Way), and except as provided in Section 20.44.062 (Mobile Home Parks), every lot developed for residential purposes shall have the number of square feet per dwelling unit indicated in Table 20.48-5: Density and Dimensional Standards. In determining the number of dwelling units permissible on a tract of land, fractions shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. 
(b)  Except in the High Density Residential District, duplexes and two-family conversions shall be allowed only on lots having at least one hundred fifty percent of the minimum square footage required for one dwelling unit on a lot in such district. 
(Ord. 1438 § 13, 2007; Ord. 1365 § 5, 2005; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.48.030 - Lot shape and minimum lot widths. 
(a)  No lot may be created that is so narrow or otherwise so irregularly shaped that it would be impracticable to construct on it a building that: 
(1)  Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district, and 
(2)  Could satisfy any applicable setback requirements for that district. 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing standard, and except as provided by Subsection (d), indicates minimum lot widths that are recommended and are deemed presumptively to satisfy the standard set forth in Subsection (a). 
(c)  Lot width shall be determined by the diameter of the largest circle that can be drawn within the boundaries of a lot. The diameter of the circle must be equal to or greater than the minimum lot width of the underlying zone. 
(d)  On the bulb of cul-de-sacs, the minimum lot frontage along the right-of-way line shall be twenty feet and forty feet at the building setback line. 
(e)  Shared driveways are preferred on the bulb of a cul-de-sac, but are allowed in other settings as approved by the Director. Shared driveways shall be a maximum of twenty-four feet in width. 
(f)  No lot created after the effective date of this title that is less than the recommended width shall be entitled to a variance from any building setback requirement. 
(Ord. 1454 § 5, 2008; Ord. 1411 § 28, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 8, 10-19-2015)  
20.48.040 - Building setback requirements. 
(a)  Subject to Section 20.48.050 Accessory Building Setback Requirements) and the other provisions of this section, no portion of any building or any freestanding sign may be located on any lot closer to any lot line than is authorized in Table 20.48-5: Density and Dimensional Standards. 
(1)  As used in this section, the term "lot boundary line" refers to lot boundaries other than those that abut streets. For the purpose of measuring setbacks, alleys shall not be considered a public street. Setbacks from alleys shall be the same as from a lot boundary line. 
(2)  As used in this section, the term "building" includes any substantial structure, which by nature of its size, scale, dimensions, bulk, or use tends to constitute a visual obstruction or generate activity similar to that usually associated with a building. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following structures shall be deemed to fall within this description: 
(A)  Gas pumps and overhead canopies or roofs. 
(B)  Fences and hedges running along lot boundaries adjacent to public street rights-of-way if such fences and hedges exceed forty-two inches, except that the setback for fences or hedges up to six feet high shall be ten feet from the ultimate right-of-way along exterior side yard lot boundaries adjacent to public streets provided that the area between the right-of-way and fence are well landscaped and maintained by the property owner. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a sign may be erected on or affixed to a structure that (i) has a principal function that is something other than the support of the sign (e.g., a fence), but (ii) does not constitute a building as defined in this title, only if such sign is located so as to comply with the setback requirement applicable to freestanding signs in the district where such sign is located. 
(b)  Whenever a lot in a nonresidential district has a common boundary line with a lot in a residential district lying in the R-MD, R-LMD or SR zone, then the setback for the non-residential property along that common boundary shall be thirty feet. 
(c)  Setback distances shall be measured from the property line to a point on the lot that is directly below the nearest extension of any part of the building that is substantially a part of the building itself, except eaves, including but not limited to chimneys, and not a mere appendage to it (such as a flagpole, etc.). 
(d)  Whenever a private road that serves more than four lots, more than four dwelling units, or that serves any nonresidential use tending to generate traffic equivalent to more than four dwelling units is located along a lot boundary, then buildings and freestanding signs shall be set back from the private road just as if such road were a public street. 
(e)  In any residential district, front porches may extend into the setback from the street right-of-way line up to fifty percent of that setback. 
(f)  All buildings shall be set back a minimum of fifteen feet from any open drainage facility. 
(g)  All buildings shall have a minimum setback of five feet from any easement. 
(h)  Marijuana producing and processing operations on lots abutting residentially zoned lots shall be set back a minimum of thirty feet for indoor operations and fifty feet for outdoor operations.

(a)  For purposes of this section: 
(1)  The height of a building shall be the vertical distance measured from the mean elevation of the finished grade of the perimeter of the building to the highest point of the building. 
(2)  A point of access to a roof shall be the top of any parapet wall or the lowest point of a roof's surface, whichever is greater. Roofs with slopes greater than seventy-five percent are regarded as walls. 
(b)  Subject to the remaining provisions of this section, building height limitations in the various zoning districts shall be as listed in Table 20.48-5: Density and Dimensional Standards. 
(c)  Subject to Subsection (d), the following features are exempt from the district height limitations set forth in Subsection (b):

(2)  The features described in Subsection (c)(3) above must be set back from the edge of the roof a minimum distance of one foot for every foot by which such features extend above the roof surface of the principal building to which they are attached. 
(3)  The permit-issuing authority may authorize or require that parapet walls be constructed (up to a height not exceeding that of the features screened) to shield the features listed in Subsections (c)(l) and (3) from view. 
(e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (b), in any zoning district the vertical distance from the ground to a point of access to a roof surface of any nonresidential building or any multi-family residential building containing four or more dwelling units may not exceed thirty-five feet unless the fire chief certifies to the permit-issuing authority that such building is designed to provide adequate access for fire fighting personnel or the building inspector certifies that the building is otherwise designed or equipped to provide adequate protection against the dangers of fire. 
(f)  Towers, monopoles, and antennas are allowed in all zoning districts to the extent authorized in Section 20.40.010 (Table of Permissible Uses), use classification 18.000. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.48.064 - Maximum lot coverage. 
(a)  The maximum allowable lot coverage with structures shall be as listed in Table 20.48-5: Density and Dimensional Standards. 
(b)  In all residential districts, no more than forty percent of the area within the setback from a street right-of-way may be an impervious surface, except, that anyone may install a driveway, up to double-wide, regardless of the coverage achieved. 
(Ord. 1365 § 6, 2005: Ord. 1312 § 15, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.48.090 - Density on lots where portion dedicated to city for park and Recreational Facilities.

1 As used in this table, "r-o-w" or "right-of-way" means the street's ultimate right-of-way according to its classification, not existing, actual right-of-way. 
2 "0" in this column means that there is no density maximum. One can build as many residential units as can fit, as long as the rest of the requirements of this code are met (e.g., parking, open space, screening, maximum lot coverage, setbacks, etc.). For instance, a density of 50 units per acre is allowed. 
3 "0" in this column means that there is no minimum parcel size. One can subdivide into as small of lots as one wants, as long as a permissible use can fit on the lot while meeting the rest of the requirements of this code (e.g., parking, open space, screening, maximum lot coverage, setbacks, etc.). 
4 Maximum setbacks are required pursuant to Section 220.46.050 (Site Design in the Old Town Business Districts (1, 2, and 3)). 
5 Airspace restrictions may limit the maximum building height to less than fifty feet. 
6 Include a rear setback for principal buildings (twenty feet) while keeping the standard five-foot setback for accessory structures.

(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 7, 10-19-2015)  
Chapter 20.52 - RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE 
 
20.52.010 - Mini-parks required. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (c), all residential developments shall provide (through dedication or reservation; see Section 20.52.040, Dedication, Ownership, and Maintenance of Recreational Areas and Open Space) recreational areas in the form of mini-parks (as described in Section 20.52.020 (Mini-Parks: Purpose and Standards) in an amount equal to sixty-five square feet per person expected to reside in that development (as determined in accordance with Subsection (b)). Such recreational areas shall be provided in addition to the open space areas required by Section 20.52.030 (Usable Open Space). 
(b)  For purposes of this section, one-bedroom dwelling units shall be deemed to house an average of 1.4 persons, two-bedroom units 2.2 persons, three-bedroom units 3.2 persons, and units with four or more bedrooms 4.0 persons. In residential subdivisions each lot that is large enough for only a single dwelling unit shall be deemed to house an average of 3.2 persons. Each lot that is large enough to accommodate more than one dwelling unit shall be deemed to house 2.2 persons for each dwelling unit that can be accommodated. 
(c)  The city council recognizes that mini-parks must be of a certain minimum size to be usable and that such mini-parks will not serve the intended purpose unless properly maintained. Therefore, residential developments that are small enough so that the amount of required mini-park space does not exceed two thousand square feet may: (i) dedicate the same amount of land outside of the project but adjacent to another park within the vicinity of the project; or (ii) deposit a fee per expected person as set by resolution (as calculated in Subsection (b)) into the "In Lieu Park Open Space Fund." Said fund is to be used for acquisition and development of mini-park land or provision of mini-park and recreation services within the service area of the plat. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.52.020 - Mini-parks: purpose and standards. 
(a)  The purpose of the mini-park is to provide adequate active recreational facilities to serve the residents of the immediately surrounding neighborhood within the development. The following are illustrative of the types of facilities that shall be deemed to serve active recreational needs and therefore to count toward satisfaction of the mini-park requirements of this chapter: tennis courts, racquetball courts, swimming pools, sauna and exercise rooms, meeting or activity rooms within clubhouses, basketball courts, sport fields, swings, slides, and play apparatus. 
(b)  Each development shall satisfy its mini-park requirement by installing the types of recreational facilities that are most likely to be suited to and used by the age bracket of persons likely to reside in that development. However, unless it appears that less than five percent of the residents of any development are likely to be children under twelve, then at least fifteen percent of the mini-park must be satisfied by the construction of "tot lots" (i.e., areas equipped with imaginative play apparatus oriented to younger children as well as seating accommodations for parents). 
(c)  For developments of up to twenty-five dwelling units, at least one recreation facility, as listed in Subsection (a), shall be provided. For developments of twenty-six to fifty dwelling units, at least two such recreation facilities shall be provided. For developments of more than fifty dwelling units, at least one additional recreation facility shall be provided for every twenty-five dwelling units or fraction thereof. Facility as used herein does not mean the whole park, but the recreational element found therein. More than one facility may be developed in any one location. 
(d)  The total acreage of mini-parks required by Section 20.52.010 (Mini-Parks Required) shall be divided into mini-parks of not less than two thousand square feet nor more than thirty thousand square feet. 
(e)  All the required mini-park acreage shall be located in one designated area, unless the permit-issuing authority determines that multiple mini-parks, each having their own recreation facilities, would better serve residents of larger projects. 
(f)  If the mini-park exceeds five thousand square feet in size, then a public street and/or parking area shall front on at least ten percent of its perimeter. 
(g)  Mini-parks shall be attractively landscaped and shall be provided with sufficient natural or manmade screening or buffer areas to minimize any negative impacts upon adjacent residences. 
(h)  Each mini-park shall be centrally located and easily accessible so that it can be conveniently and safely reached and used by those persons in the surrounding neighborhood it is designed to serve as well as public safety personnel. 
(i)  Each mini-park shall be constructed on land that is relatively flat (maximum five percent slope), dry, and capable of serving the purposes intended by this chapter. 
(j)  Mini-parks shall not be placed in or near utility easements for major transmission lines (e.g., power, natural gas, etc.). 
(k)  Mini-parks shall be roughly square or rectangular, and in no instance have a dimension less than thirty feet or a length to width ratio greater than 2:1. 
(l)  Each mini park shall be constructed in compliance with the city's mini-park standards, and include water and electric services. A park plan shall be submitted as part of the preliminary plat application containing the requirements specified in the submittal checklist. 
(m)  An applicant may propose a mini-park that differs from the above requirements provided that the intent of the requirements is met. As part of the land use permit application, the applicant shall submit a letter documenting the reason(s) for the proposed deviation(s) and how the intent of the requirement has been satisfied. 
(Ord. 1438 § 15, 2007; Ord. 1411 § 29, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.52.024 - Community parks impact fee. 
In addition to the requirements of Section 20.52.010 (Mini-Parks Required) each residential development shall pay a community park impact fee pursuant to Section 20.90.400 (Community Parks Impact Fee). 
(Ord. 1351 § 8, 2004: Ord. 1312 § 17, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.52.030 - Usable open space. 
(a)  Except as provided in Subsection (c), every residential development shall be developed so that at least five percent of the total area of the development remains permanently as usable open space. 
(b)  For purposes of this section, usable open space means an area that: 
(1)  Is not encumbered with any substantial structure or utility easement for distribution lines, 
(2)  Is not devoted to use as a roadway, parking area, or sidewalk, 
(3)  Is left (as of the date development began) in its natural or undisturbed state if wooded, except for the cutting of trails for walking or jogging, or, if not wooded at the time of development, is landscaped for ball fields, picnic areas, or similar facilities, or is properly vegetated and landscaped with the objective of creating a wooded area or other area that is consistent with the objective set forth in Subdivision (4), 
(4)  Is capable of being used and enjoyed for purposes of informal and unstructured recreation and relaxation, 
(5)  Is legally and practicably accessible to the residents of the development out of which the required open space is taken, or to the public if dedication of the open space is required pursuant to Section 20.52.040 (Dedication, Ownership, and Maintenance of Recreational Areas and Open Space), 
(6)  Consists of land no more than twenty-five percent of which lies within a floodplain or floodway as those terms are defined in Section 20.08.010 (Definitions of Basic Terms) or of slopes greater than five percent, or a critical area buffer, 
(7)  The length of the area shall be no more than twice its width, and 
(8)  Those environmentally critical areas protected pursuant to Chapter 20.88 (Environmentally Critical Areas) shall not be counted toward the project's usable open space requirement. 
(c)  Subdivided residential developments of less than twenty-five dwelling units are exempt from the requirements of this section unless the city agrees that it will accept an offer of dedication of such open space, and in that case the offer of dedication shall be made. 
(Ord. 1411 § 5, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.52.040 - Dedication, ownership, and maintenance of recreational areas and open space. 
(a)  Unless otherwise agreed to by council, all park and recreation facilities and other open space to be provided by the developer in accordance with this chapter shall remain under the ownership and control of the developer (or his successor) or a homeowners association or similar organization that satisfies the criteria established in Section 20.52.060 (Homeowners Associations). 
(b)  If any portion of any lot proposed for residential development lies within an area designated on the officially adopted recreation master plan as a neighborhood park or part of the greenway system or bikeway system, the area so designated (not exceeding five percent of the total lot area) shall be included as part of the area set aside to satisfy the requirement of Section 20.52.030 (Usable Open Space). This area shall be dedicated to public use. 
(c)  If more than five percent of a lot proposed for residential development lies within an area designated as provided in Subsection (b), the city may attempt to acquire the additional land in the following manner: 
(1)  The city may purchase or condemn the land. 
(d)  The person or entity identified in Subsection (a) as having the right of ownership and control over such recreational facilities and open space shall be responsible for the continuing upkeep and proper maintenance of the same. 
(Ord. 1438 § 16, 2007; Ord. 1312 § 18, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.52.060 - Homeowners associations. 
Homeowners associations or similar legal entities that, pursuant to Section 20.52.040 (Dedication, Ownership, and Maintenance of Recreational Areas and Open Space), are responsible for the maintenance and control of common areas, including recreational facilities and open space, shall be established in such a manner that: 
(1)  Provision for the establishment of the association or similar entity is made before any lot in the development is sold or any building occupied; 
(2)  The association or similar legal entity has clear legal authority to maintain and exercise control over such common areas and facilities; 
(3)  The association or similar legal entity has the power to compel contributions from residents of the development to cover their proportionate shares of the costs associated with the maintenance and upkeep of such common areas and facilities. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.52.070 - Flexibility in administration authorized. 
(a)  The requirements set forth in this chapter concerning the amount, size, location, and nature of recreational facilities and open space to be provided in connection with residential developments are established by the council as standards that presumptively will result in the provision of that amount of recreational facilities and open space that is consistent with officially adopted city plans. The council recognizes, however, that due to the particular nature of a tract of land, or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation, or other factors, the underlying objectives of this chapter may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision. Therefore, the permit-issuing body is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that: (i) the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them; and (ii) because of peculiarities in the developer's tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards. 
(b)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this chapter pursuant to Subsection (a), the official record of action taken on the development application shall contain a statement of the reasons for allowing the deviation. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
Chapter 20.56 - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
 
20.56.010 - Street classification. 
(a)  Except as provided for in Subsection (c), in all new development, all streets shall be dedicated to public use, and shall be classified as provided in Subsection (b). 
(1)  Most streets are provided a classification by the transportation element of the city's comprehensive plan. Where a street is not classified therein, the classification shall be based upon the projected volume of traffic to be carried by the street, stated in terms of the number of trips per day; 
(2)  The number of dwelling units to be served by the street may be used as an indicator of the number of trips but is not conclusive; 
(3)  Whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time, the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety, both within and outside of the subdivision. 
(b)  The classification of streets and other rights-of-way generally shall be as follows (see Chapter 20.08, Definitions, for definitions of each): 
(1)  Pedestrian-way. 
(2)  Minor Trail. 
(3)  Major Trail. 
(4)  Utility Easement. 
(5)  Alley. 
(6)  Access Tract or Easement. 
(A)  A Single Family Residential Access Tract or Easement. 
(B)  A Non-Single Family Residential Access Tract or Easement. 
(7)  Cul-de-sac. 
(8)  Local Access. 
(9)  Local Collector. 
(10)  Collector Arterial. 
(11)  Arterial (four-lane). 
(12)  Arterial (five-lane). 
(13)  County Road. 
(14)  State Highway. 
(15)  Frontage Street. 
(c)  Neither Single Family Residential nor Non-Single-Family-Residential Access Tracts or Easements, where allowed, shall be dedicated to the public. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.020 - Costs of right-of-way installation and improvements borne by applicant. 
When rights-of-way improvements are required or volunteer in conjunction with permit approval, all costs and expenses incident to the installation of the improvements to be dedicated to the public shall be borne by the applicant. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.030 - Access to lots. 
Every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use. Access includes vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and other common forms of transportation. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.040 - Access to arterial streets. 
Whenever a development that involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, no direct driveway access may be provided from the lots within this subdivision onto this street unless no other access is possible. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.050 - Entrances to streets. 
(a)  All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the city's planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that: 
(1)  Vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles traveling in abutting streets, and 
(2)  Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized. In particular, driveways or other openings onto collector arterials, arterials, or state highways shall be designed so as to not require that vehicles back out onto the public street. 
(3)  Driveway cuts shall be limited so the narrowest width necessary to provide safe ingress and egress onto and from the property, as determined by the public works director. 
(4)  Driveways shall not be located adjacent to one another in such a manner as to create a "double width" driveway without any landscaping between the driveways. 
(b)  Specifications for driveway entrances are set forth in the administrative guideline entitled "Public Works' Construction Standards and Specifications." If driveway entrances and other openings onto streets are constructed in accordance with the foregoing specifications and requirements, this shall be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in Subsection (a). 
(c)  For purposes of this section, the term prima facie evidence means that the permit-issuing authority may (but is not required to) conclude from this evidence alone that the proposed development complies with Subsection (a). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.060 - Neighborhood access and coordination with surrounding streets. 
(a)  All developments which shall create or cause to exist more than forty-nine dwelling units or more (new or a combination of new and existing) or non-residential developments that may attract one hundred fifty or more people (including employees and customers) at any one time (new or a combination of new and existing) shall have more than one point of access to the surrounding public street. An applicant may request in writing a waiver of this code requirement. The city, in its sole discretion, may waive this requirement when, in the opinion of the fire chief or his or her designee, adverse life and safety issues are adequately addressed by the proposed development. For the purposes of this section, an emergency access (crash gate) shall not be considered a vehicular access point and a boulevard shall be considered one access point. 
(b)  From the point where a neighborhood has one point of access, no lot shall be more than six hundred feet from the common point of access unless no other practicable alternative is available in the opinion of the public works director. 
(c)  The street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing, proposed, and anticipated streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion of a single tract that is being divided into lots (hereinafter, "surrounding streets") as provided in this section. 
(d)  Collector streets shall intersect with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and convenient locations. 
(e)  Local collectors and local access streets shall connect with surrounding streets where necessary to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons. 
(f)  Whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section, the street right-of-way shall be extended and the street developed to the far property line of the subdivided property (or to the far edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract) at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected. In addition, the permit-issuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles. Temporary access easements shall be granted over portions of such turn-arounds, which may be automatically relinquished upon extension of the right-of-way. Frontage improvements need not be installed on bulb of the temporary turn-around; the developer extending the right-of-way shall install these. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, no temporary dead-end street in excess of one thousand feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is available. 
(Ord. 1438 § 17, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.070 - Relationship of streets to topography. 
(a)  Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and storm water runoff objectives set forth in Chapter 20.64 (Flooding, Floodways, Drainage, and Erosion), and street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography. 
(b)  The maximum grade at any point on a street shall not exceed that set in Table 20.56-6 unless no other practicable alternative is available. However, in no case may streets be constructed with grades that, in the professional opinion of the public works director, create a substantial danger to the public safety.

20.56.080 - Street width, sidewalk, and drainage requirements in subdivisions. 
(a)  Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; (ii) to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and (iii) to serve as an important link in the city's drainage system. In order to fulfill these objectives, all public streets shall be constructed to meet either the standards set forth in Subsection (b) or Subsection (c). 
(b)  All existing and planned arterial or larger streets which the city deems necessary for the completion of the city's transportation system are shown and classified in the city's transportation plan, which is found in the comprehensive plan. However, that list is non-exhaustive and a permit applicant may propose other streets.

(c)  Any permit application shall be reviewed for conformance with the transportation plan. If a planned street is shown to run through or adjacent to a property proposed for development, the proposal must include a roadway system in general conformance to this plan, including the dedication of the appropriate full or half-street right-of-way for the street, as shown in Table 20.56-6, to be in conformance with the comprehensive plan. 
(d)  All public streets shall be constructed with curb, gutter, sidewalk, and, as provided in Section 20.76.110 (Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets), landscape strips and street trees. Only standard vertical curb may be used. Street pavement width shall be measured from curb face to curb face. 
(e)  Sidewalks required by this section shall be at least five feet in width, on both sides of streets, and constructed according to the specifications set forth in the administrative guideline entitled "Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications." 
(f)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from the subdivision to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets as required above, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet in width to provide such access. 
(Ord. 1454 § 9, 2008; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003). 
(Ord. No. 2010-001, § 10(Exh. B), 1-8-2010)  
20.56.090 - General layout of streets. 
(a)  All streets shall be in compliance with the transportation plan of the comprehensive plan. Additionally, streets in an existing grid system or area in which an existing grid system can be extended shall be straight whenever practicable to the extent necessary to preserve and continue the grid system. 
(b)  The maximum and minimum width of blocks should be that which is sufficient to allow for two tiers of lots (plus width of an alley or public utility easement, if any), unless existing conditions are such, in the judgment of the decision-making authority, to render such requirements undesirable or impractical. 
(c)  The maximum length of residential blocks in an existing or extended grid system should be four hundred feet; those not in a grid system should be one thousand two hundred feet, and the minimum length should be four hundred feet, unless no other practicable alternative is available. 
(d)  In all cases, streets shall be laid out so that the lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks adequately address the following. 
(1)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the type of use contemplated; 
(2)  The zoning requirements can be met on future building permits; 
(3)  The limitations and opportunities of the topography; 
(4)  The needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic are considered.

(f)  Pedestrian-ways shall be required near the middle of all blocks longer than eight hundred feet unless deemed infeasible by the permit issuing authority. 
(g)  Where a tract is subdivided into lots or tracts of an acre or more, the decision-making authority may require an arrangement of lots and streets such as to permit a later re-subdivision in conformance with the street and lot requirements specified in these regulations. 
(h)  There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where such strips are required by the city. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.100 - Dead end streets/cul-de-sacs. 
(a)  Dead-end streets shall be avoided. Cul-de-sacs may be used only when conditions warrant their use. Maximizing the number of lots in a project does not warrant their use. Where roads have a potential for extending to adjacent properties and creating connections (either current or future) they should do so. 
(b)  When allowed under Subsection (a), all permanent dead-end streets (as opposed to temporary dead-end streets, see Subsection 20.56.060(d) (Neighborhood Access and Coordination with Surrounding Streets) shall be developed as cul-de-sacs in accordance with the standards set forth in Subsection (d).

(a)  Temporary three-fourth-streets (i.e., streets of less than the full-required right-of-way and pavement width) may be allowed at the discretion of the decision-making authority under the following conditions: 
(1)  Where such street, when combined with a similar street developed previously, simultaneously, or anticipated to be built within a reasonable time frame on property adjacent to the subdivision, creates or comprises a street that meets the right-of-way and pavement requirements of this title. 
(2)  Where no more than ten dwelling units will use the three-fourth-street. 
(3)  Where a temporary three-fourth-street is allowed, the portion to be built shall be paved, at a minimum, to a width equal to three-fourth of the ultimate paved width. Curb, gutter, sidewalk, landscape strip, and street trees are to be built in conjunction with each respective half-street on the side adjacent to the proposed project. 
(4)  Where a public right-of-way easement has been or is being dedicated to the city over those portions of the adjacent property to be used as a half-street. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.120 - Street intersections. 
(a)  Streets shall intersect at eighty °to ninety °. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point or vary from the above angle of intersection unless the public works director certifies to the permit-issuing authority that such an intersection can be constructed with no extraordinary danger to public safety. 
(b)  Whenever possible, proposed intersections along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed intersections on the opposite side of such street. In any event, where a centerline offset (jog) occurs at an intersection, the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets shall be not less than one hundred fifty feet. On any street classified as an arterial the distance between centerlines of the intersecting streets shall be not less than three hundred feet. 
(c)  Except when no other alternative is practicable or legally possible, no two streets may intersect with an arterial on the same side at a distance of less than one thousand feet measured from centerline to centerline of the intersecting street. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.130 - Construction standards and specifications. 
Construction and design standards and specifications for streets, sidewalks, and curbs and gutters are contained in the administrative guideline entitled "Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications," and all such facilities shall be completed in accordance with these standards. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.140 - Construction drawings required prior to installation. 
(a)  No right-of-way improvements shall be installed without first obtaining construction plan approval from the public works director. Said right-of-way improvement plans shall be prepared pursuant to the "Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications." 
(b)  Site civil plans shall be valid for eighteen months from approval date. One six-month extension may be granted by the public works director if requested in writing by the applicant prior to original expiration date. If plans expire, an additional fee (fifty percent of original plan review fee, as set by resolution) shall be assessed to re-review the plans for compliance with current standards. 
(Ord. 1392 § 11, 2006: Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)

(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.56.160 - Public streets and private roads in subdivisions. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, all lots created after the effective date of this section shall abut a public street at least to the extent necessary to comply with the access requirement set forth in Section 20.56.030 (Access to Lots) while also meeting the requirements of Section 20.48.030 (Lot Shape and Minimum Lot Widths). For purposes of this subsection, the term "public street" includes a preexisting public street as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets the public street standards of this title and is dedicated for public use. The recordation of a plat shall constitute an offer of dedication of such street. 
(b)  Private roads shall not be allowed in subdivided residential developments. 
(c)  Private access tracts in single-family residence developments may be allowed only where they provide access for four or fewer dwelling units. Where a private access tract is used, and an adjacent property is capable of being short platted with a private access tract, such tracts shall be located in such a way so as to allow them to be combined into one right-of-way sized as a local access in the event that the property owners wish to improve and dedicate it as a public street. 
(Ord. 1365 § 7, 2005; Ord. No. 1312, § 19, 11-17-2003; Ord. 1309 §5(part), 2003)

(b)  The public works director may deem Subsection (a) fulfilled under the below listed circumstances. It shall be at the public works director's discretion, based on knowledge of upcoming projects in the vicinity, safety issues, or sound engineering judgment, as to which method shall be allowed or not allowed. Improvements may be deemed fully installed: 
(1)  Where the rights-of-way are already improved to their classification standards and dedicated to the city. 
(2)  Where the city chooses to purchase rights-of-way and install the improvements. However, under no circumstances is the city obligated to do this. 
(3)  Where the applicant, understanding that the land use or building permit sought cannot be issued until the improvements are deemed installed by the public works director, installs or agrees to install the improvements himself at his own cost and offers the rights-of-way to the public. "Agreement to install" may be effected by the applicant accepting a permit containing a condition to install said improvements and not appealing the permit on this condition. 
(4)  Where the applicant has dedicated the rights-of-way to the public and provided a surety bond ensuring that the improvements shall be installed within one year. Said warranty bond shall meet the requirements of Chapter 20.12 (Administrative Mechanisms). 
(5)  If Subsections 1-4 are deemed infeasible by the public works director: Where the applicant has dedicated the rights-of-way to the public and elected to pay to the city an amount equal to the cost of installing the improvements. In such circumstances, said monies would be maintained in an account to be used specifically for improvements on that right-of-way within the general vicinity of the project.

(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.110 - Determining compliance with Section 20.60.100. 
(a)  Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the standard set forth in Section 20.60.100 (Sewage Disposal Facilities Required) may lie with an agency other than the city, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency. The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (b). Whenever any such agency requires detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed sewage disposal system, the authority issuing a permit under this chapter may rely upon a preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed sewage disposal system to determine compliance with Section 20.60.100 (Sewage Disposal Facilities Required). However, construction of such system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such agency. 
(b)  In the following if-then list, the if statement describes the type of development and the then statement indicates the agency that must certify to the city whether the proposed sewage disposal system complies with the standard set forth in Section 20.60.100 (Sewage Disposal Facilities Required). 
(1)  If: The use is located on a lot that is served by a public sewer system and the use can be served by a connection to the system (as in the case of a single family residence) rather than the construction of an internal collection system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex): 
Then: No further certification is necessary. 
(2)  If: The use (other than a subdivision or short plat) is located on a lot that is served by the city sewer system but service to the use necessitates construction of an internal collection system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex); and the internal collection system is to be transferred to and maintained by the city: 
Then: The public works director must certify to the city that the proposed internal collection system meets the city's specifications and will be accepted by the city. 
(3)  If: The use (other than a subdivision or short plat) is not served by the city system but, pursuant to Section 20.60.120 (Private Sewage Disposal), is qualified to be served by a privately operated sewage treatment system (that has not previously been approved) designed to serve one equivalent residential unit (ERU): 
Then: The Snohomish County Health District (SCHD) must certify to the city that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and local health regulations. 
(4)  If: The proposed use is a subdivision or short plat; and 
(A)  Lots within the subdivision or short plat are to be served by connection to existing public lines: 
Then: No further certification is necessary. 
(B)  Lots within the subdivision or short plat are to be served by the city system but the developer will be responsible for installing the necessary additions to the public sewer system: 
Then: The public works director must certify to the city that the proposed system meets the city's specifications and will be accepted by the city. 
(C)  Lots within the subdivision or short plat are, pursuant to 20.60.120 (Private Sewage Disposal), qualified to be served by independent sewage treatment systems: 
Then: The Snohomish County Health District must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and local health regulations and that the lot can be served by an on-site disposal system.

(2)  The property is not located in the Arlington Municipal Aquifer Recharge Area; and, 
(3)  A public sanitary sewer line is not within five hundred feet of the lot proposed for development; and, 
(4)  The city so certifies and approves; and, 
(5)  The Snohomish Health District approves the system; and, 
(6)  The system complies with all applicable laws and regulations. 
(b)  Pursuant to RCW 70.64 and WAC 248.96, the city recognizes the Snohomish County Health District as the legitimate agency to supervise and direct the on-site sewer system permit process. All permitting and inspection of private sewage disposal systems shall be done by the Snohomish Health District, provided that any application to the Health District for installation of a new on-site sewage system must be accompanied by a letter from the city stating that no sanitary systems are available and that the proposed on-site sewage system conforms to applicable City Code requirements. The property owner shall pay all related health district fees. The property owner shall furnish a copy of the Snohomish Health District permit to the city by prior to any construction work. The property owner shall furnish a copy of the as-built drawings to the city. 
(c)  An appropriate fee may be established by resolution for the above service provided by the city. 
(d)  Connections to public sewer shall be required when public sewer becomes available. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.130 - Conveyance of facilities to city. 
(a)  Any private or public sewer facility not owned by the city may be conveyed to the city if it meets the criteria listed in Subsection (b). If the city accepts that conveyance, the sewer thereafter shall be a public sewer under the jurisdiction of the city. 
(b)  The following criteria shall be met, unless otherwise waived by the public works director, prior to conveyance of sewer facilities to the city: 
(1)  A public utility easement of adequate dimensions shall be concurrently granted to the city. 
(2)  The facilities shall be inspected for conformance with the standards specified herein for public sewer facilities. The public works director may require any test to demonstrate such conformance. Such tests may include, but are not limited to, infiltration, exfiltration, air tests, or a combination thereof. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the public works director when the building sewer is ready for inspection. 
(3)  The applicant shall pay any and all required fees, as per this title and AMC Title 13. 
(4)  The public works director may require that a maintenance bond be provided to ensure workmanship for a period of two years.

Part III. - Water 
 
20.60.300 - Water supply system required. 
Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a water supply system that is adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use or subdivision lot and that complies with all applicable health regulations. Such uses or subdivision lots shall be connected to a public water system before the completion of the construction of such building or structure or, under special circumstances and with the public works director's authorization, before any occupancy or use thereof. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.310 - Determining compliance with Section 20.60.300. 
(a)  Primary responsibility for determining whether a proposed development will comply with the standard set forth in Section 20.60.300 (Water Supply System Required) often lies with an agency other than the city, and the developer must comply with the detailed standards and specifications of such other agency. The relevant agencies are listed in Subsection (b). Whenever any such agency requires detailed construction or design drawings before giving its official approval to the proposed water supply system, the authority issuing a permit under this chapter may rely upon a preliminary review by such agency of the basic design elements of the proposed water supply system to determine compliance with Section 20.60.300 (Water Supply System Required). However, construction of such system may not be commenced until the detailed plans and specifications have been reviewed and any appropriate permits issued by such agency. 
(b)  In the following if-then list, the if statement describes the type of development and the then statement indicates the agency that must certify to the city whether the proposed water system complies with the standard set forth in Section 20.60.300 (Water Supply System Required). 
(1)  If: The use is located on a lot that is served by the city of Arlington water system or a previously approved, privately owned public water supply system and the use can be served by a simple connection to the system (as in the case of a single family residence) rather than the construction of an internal distribution system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex): 
Then: No further certification is necessary. 
(2)  If: The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot that is served by the city of Arlington water system but service to the use necessitates construction of an internal distribution system (as in the case of a shopping center or apartment complex); and 
(A)  The internal distribution system is to be transferred to and maintained by the city of Arlington. 
Then: The public works director must certify to the city that the proposed internal distribution system meets city of Arlington specifications and will be accepted by the city of Arlington. 
(3)  If: The use (other than a subdivision) is located on a lot not served by the city of Arlington system or a previously approved, privately owned public water supply system; and 
(A)  The use is to be served by a privately owned public water supply system that has not previously been approved: 
Then: The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and federal regulations. The city of Arlington must also approve the distribution lines for possible future addition to the city system. 
(B)  The use is to be served by some other source (such as an individual well): 
Then: The Snohomish County Health District must certify that the proposed system meets all applicable state and local regulations and the city of Arlington must approve the proposed system. 
(4)  If: The proposed use is a subdivision; and 
(A)  Lots within the subdivision are to be served by simple connection to existing city lines or lines of a previously approved public water supply system: 
Then: No further certification is necessary. 
(B)  Lots within the subdivision are to be served by the city of Arlington system but the developer will be responsible for installing the necessary additions to such system: 
Then: The public works director must certify that the proposed system meets city of Arlington specifications and will be accepted by the city. 
(C)  Lots within the subdivision are to be served by a privately owned public water supply system that has not previously been approved: 
Then: The Snohomish County Health District (SCHD) must certify that the proposed system complies with all applicable state and federal regulations. The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) must also approve the plans. The city of Arlington must also approve the distribution lines for possible future addition to the city system. 
(D)  Lots within the subdivision are to be served by individual wells: 
Then: The Snohomish County Health District must certify to the city that each lot intended to be served by a well can be served in accordance with applicable health regulations. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
Part IV. - Other Utilities 
 
20.60.400 - Lighting requirements. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (b), all public streets, sidewalks, and other common areas or facilities in subdivisions created after the effective date of this chapter shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such streets, sidewalks, and other common areas or facilities. 
(b)  All roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common areas and facilities in unsubdivided developments shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots, and other common areas and facilities.

(d)  All outdoor lights shall be low sodium or similar lamp type and be down-shielded to prevent light pollution. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.410 - Excessive illumination. 
Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot or public right-of-way and substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of such other lot or public right-of-way is prohibited. Lighting unnecessarily illuminates another lot if it clearly exceeds the standard set forth in Section 20.60.400 (Lighting Requirements) or if the standard set forth in Section 20.60.400 could reasonably be achieved in a manner that would not substantially interfere with the use or enjoyment of neighboring properties. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.420 - Electric power. 
Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a source of electric power adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such subdivision. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  If the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing power line and the use can be served by a simple connection to such power line (as opposed to a more complex distribution system, such as would be required in an apartment complex or shopping center), then no further certification is needed. 
(2)  If the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing power line or a substantial internal distribution system will be necessary, then the electric utility service provider must review the proposed plans and certify to the city that it can provide service that is adequate to meet the needs of the proposed use and every lot within the proposed subdivision. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.430 - Natural gas services. 
Whenever it is legally possible to connect a lot with a natural gas line by running a connecting line not more than five hundred feet from the lot to such line, then every lot within a new residential subdivision or short plat shall have available to it a source of natural gas adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such subdivision. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.440 - Telephone service. 
Every principal use and every building lot within a subdivision must have available to it a telephone service cable adequate to accommodate the reasonable needs of such use and every lot within such subdivision. Compliance with this requirement shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  If the use is not a subdivision and is located on a lot that is served by an existing telephone line and the use can be served by a simple connection to such power line (as opposed to a more complex distribution system, such as would be required in an apartment complex or shopping center), then no further certification is necessary. 
(2)  If the use is a subdivision or is not located on a lot served by an existing telephone line or a substantial internal distribution system will be necessary, then the telephone utility company must review the proposed plans and certify to the city that it can provide service that is adequate to meet the needs of the proposed use and every lot within the proposed subdivision. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.450 - Underground utilities. 
(a)  Except as noted in Subsections (b-e), all existing, extended, and new electric power lines (not to include transformers or enclosures containing electrical equipment including, but not limited to, switches, meters, or capacitors which may be pad mounted), telephone, gas distribution, cable television, and other communication and utility lines in or adjacent to any land use or building permit approved after the effective date of this chapter shall be placed underground in accordance with the specifications and policies of the respective utility service providers and located in accordance with the administrative guideline entitled "Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications." Even in the event the distribution line originates from a point opposite any public roadway from the new construction the service lines shall be placed beneath said roadway by means of boring or surface excavation across said roadway. 
(b)  Building permits to construct a single one- or two-family residence shall not be required to underground existing utility lines. 
(c)  Building permits for additions, alterations, or repairs within any twenty-four-month period and equal to less than fifty percent of the total value of the existing building or structure shall not be subject to the requirements of this section. 
(d)  Existing utilities in alleys need not be undergrounded. 
(e)  If it is determined that an underground system cannot reasonably be installed according to accepted engineering practices, the requirements of this section may be waived upon receipt of a written notice from the appropriate utility service provider. Similarly, this requirement may be waived for small in-fill developments where the majority of the utilities along the street are still above ground and little more development is anticipated. In either case, such a waiver shall be noted in the permit or shall be construed as not being granted. If undergrounding of utilities is waived, the applicant must sign either a concomitant agreement or a no protest agreement of the formation of an L.I.D. for future undergrounding. Determination of which form of promissory shall be used shall be at the discretion of the public works director. Additionally, the developer shall install the appropriate conduit for future undergrounding of the utilities in the appropriate place. 
(f)  Nothing in this section nor any other section in relation to underground utilities shall apply to power lines carrying a voltage of fifteen kV or more, nor shall it be construed to prohibit the placement of said mounted transformers, terminal pedestal, or other electrical and communications devices above ground, as determined by the appropriate utility service provider involved. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.460 - Utilities to be consistent with internal and external development. 
(a)  Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby developments, such utility facilities (e.g., water or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be made conveniently and without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service. The public works director shall approve the location. In all cases, utility lines shall extend to the common property line(s) of the subject property and the property(ies) anticipated to undergo future development. 
(b)  All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue damage to improvements or facilities located within the development. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.470 - As-built drawings required. 
Whenever a developer installs or causes to be installed any utility line within the city, or connects to existing facilities within the city, the developer shall, as soon as practicable after installation is complete, and before acceptance of any sewer line, furnish the city with a copy of a drawing that shows the exact location of such utility lines. An electronic copy of the as-built drawings shall also be provided to the department of public works. Both formats shall be in a format acceptable to the director, and as specified in the "Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications." The utility service provider must verify such drawings as accurate. Compliance with this requirement shall be a condition of the continued validity of the permit authorizing such development. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.60.490 - Sites for and screening of dumpsters. 
(a)  Every development that, under the city's solid waste collection policies, is or will be required to provide one or more dumpsters for solid waste collection shall provide sites for such dumpsters that are: 
(1)  Located so as to facilitate collection and minimize any negative impact on persons occupying the development site, neighboring properties, or public rights-of-way, and 
(2)  Constructed according to specifications established by the public works director to allow for collection without damage to the development site or the collection vehicle. 
(b)  All such dumpsters shall be screened if and to the extent that, in the absence of screening, they would be clearly visible to: 
(1)  Persons located within any dwelling unit on residential property other than that where the dumpster is located; or, 
(2)  Occupants, customers, or other invitees located within any building on nonresidential property other than that where the dumpster is located, unless such other property is used primarily for purposes permitted exclusively in a Light Industrial or Industrial zoning district; or, 
(3)  Persons traveling on any public street, sidewalk, or other public way. 
(c)  When dumpster screening is required under this section, such screening shall be constructed, installed, and located to prevent or remedy the conditions requiring the screening.

Former ch. 20.64 pertained to "Floodways, floodplains, drainage, and erosion," and was derived from Ord. 1309 § 5(part), adopted 2003; Ord. No. 1351, § 9, adopted September 7, 2004; Ord. No. 1365, § 19—23, adopted June 13, 2005; Ord. No. 2011-030, §§ 1—14, adopted December 5, 2011; Ord. No. 2014-005, §§ 1, 2, adopted June 16, 2014 and Ord. No. 2015-022, § 1, adopted October 19, 2015. 
 
Part I. - Administrative Provisions 
 
20.64.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of Washington has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.020 - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The special flood hazard areas of the city encompass a very small area (two-tenths of one percent) of the developable lands within the corporate limits of the city. These areas are subject to periodic inundation of floodwaters due to storm surges and runoff, which may result in property damage, public safety, disruption of commerce, and other consequences. 
(b)  The National Flood Insurance Program is adopted by the city, which aims to reduce the impact of flooding on private and public structures. It does so by providing affordable insurance to property owners and by encouraging communities to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations. The efforts help mitigate the effects of flooding on new and improved structures. 
(c)  On September 22, 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued a biological opinion that required changes to the implementation of the National Flood Insurance Program in order to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the Puget Sound Watershed. The city enacted regulations that allow development that meets the criteria specified in the biological opinion as a "Door 2" community. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To manage development in a manner reducing impacts to floodplain processes; 
(3)  To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects; 
(4)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(5)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(6)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(7)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(8)  To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and, 
(9)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Regulating development in special flood hazard areas (SFHA); 
(2)  Requiring that all development and land use activity be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Regulating filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may have an adverse impact on flood waters; and 
(4)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
The term does not, however, include either: 
(3)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(4)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Water dependent" means a structure for commerce or industry that cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water because of the intrinsic nature of its operations. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.060 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
(a)  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for Snohomish County and Incorporated Areas" (in which the city is incorporated) dated September 16, 2005, or as amended, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), as amended, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section. The flood insurance study and the FIRM are on file at Arlington City Hall, 238 North Olympic, Arlington, Washington. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in subsection (b) shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued which incorporates the data utilized under subsection (b). 
(b)  When base flood elevation data has not been provided (A and V zones) in accordance with subsection (a), the administrator shall use any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to comply with Section 20.64.170 (Specific standards for zones A1-30, AH, and AE) and Section 20.64.180 (Specific standards for designated regulatory floodways). 
(c)  If such data are not already available, the administrator may rely on a licensed surveyor to provide such information as necessary to reasonably ascertain said zones.

20.64.070 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.080 - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and, 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.090 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
Part II. - Development Regulations 
 
20.64.100 - Supplementary information required with a permit application. 
In addition to the standard information required on a permit application, the following information is also required for any permits proposing development within a floodway or floodplain, watercourse alteration or relocation: 
(1)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
(2)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed; 
(3)  Elevation certification by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
(4)  Notify adjacent communities and the department of ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration. 
(5)  Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.110 - Location of boundaries of floodplain and floodway districts. 
(a)  As used in this chapter, the terms floodplain and floodway refer in the first instance to certain areas whose boundaries are determined and can be located on the ground by reference to the specific fluvial characteristics set forth in the definitions of these terms. These terms also refer to overlay zoning districts whose boundaries correspond to the actual physical location of floodways and floodplains as shown on FEMA's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and should be shown on the map identified in the city's adopted shoreline master plan. (These overlay districts thus differ from other zoning districts whose boundaries are established solely according to planning or policy, rather than physical, criteria.) Therefore, the administrator is authorized to make necessary interpretations as to the exact location of the boundaries of floodways or floodplains if there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. Such interpretations, like other decisions of the administrator, may be appealed pursuant to Section 20.20.010 (Appeals). 
(b)  As used in this chapter the term riparian habitat zone (RHZ) is identified on the approved RHZ map. The RHZ is an overlay zone that encompasses lands as defined above on either side of all streams, and for all other watercourse including off channel areas within the special flood hazard areas. The RHZ is a no new disturbance zone, other than for activities that will not adversely affect the existing habitat function. Any property or portion thereof that lies within the RHZ is subject to the restrictions of the RHZ, as well as any zoning restriction that apply to the parcel in the underlying zoning. Unless shown otherwise the RHZ on a channel migration zone is fifty feet. 
(c)  When updating the maps the city must consider future conditions and the cumulative effect from the future land-use changes. 
(d)  When updating the maps the city must consider identifying and evaluating the risk of flooding behind one hundred-year levees within the city jurisdiction based on future conditions and cumulative effects. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.120 - Setbacks from streams RHZ within the floodplain. 
Table 20.64.120: Stream Buffer Width 1 
Type 	Buffer 
S 	250 feet 
F - > 5 feet wide and marine shorelines 	150 feet 
F - < 5 feet wide and lakes 	150 feet 
N - perennial and seasonal streams 	150 — 225 feet 2 
 
1 Channel migration zone (CMZ) plus fifty feet. 
2 Depending on slope stability. 
(1)  Communities must use the most restrictive data available for the CMZ, floodway, future conditions, and RHZ's. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.130 - Artificial obstructions within floodways prohibited. 
(a)  No artificial obstruction may be located within any floodway, except as provided in Section 20.64.140 (Permissible uses within floodways). 
(b)  For purposes of this section, an artificial obstruction is any obstruction, other than a natural obstruction, that is capable of reducing the flood-carrying capacity of a stream or may accumulate debris and thereby reduce the flood-carrying capacity of a stream. A natural obstruction includes any rock, tree, gravel, or analogous natural matter that is an obstruction and has been located within the floodway by a non-human cause. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.140 - Permissible uses within floodways. 
(a)  Notwithstanding Chapter 20.40 (Permissible Uses), no permit to make use of land within a floodway may be issued unless the proposed use is listed as permissible in the Table of Permissible Uses, Chapter 20.93 (Critical Areas Ordinance), and in the following list: 
(1)  General habitat restoration, farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. 
(2)  Ground-level loading areas, parking areas, boat launch, rotary aircraft ports, and other similar ground-level area uses. 
(3)  Lawns, gardens, play areas, and other similar uses. 
(4)  Golf courses, tennis courts, driving ranges, archery ranges, picnic grounds, parks, hiking or horseback-riding trails, open space, and other similar private and public recreational uses. 
(b)  General development standards to be followed in special flood hazard area include: 
(1)  If a lot has a buildable site out of the special flood hazard area, all new structures shall be located there, when feasible. If the lot is fully in the floodplain, structures must be located to have the least impact on salmon. 
(A)  All structures must be set back at least fifteen feet from the protected area and sited as close to the SFHA boundary as possible. 
(2)  Stormwater and drainage features shall incorporate low impact development techniques that mimic pre-development hydrologic conditions, when technically feasible. 
(3)  Creation of new impervious surfaces shall not exceed ten percent of the surface area of the portion of the lot in the floodplain unless mitigation is provided. 
(4)  Uses that are not permitted in the protected area unless shown not to adversely affect water quality, habitat, and large woody debris include; septic tanks and drain fields, dumping of any materials, hazardous or sanitary waste landfills: receiving area for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
(5)  (A)  The proposed action must be designed and located so that new structural flood protection is not needed. 
(B)  All bank stabilization measures requiring armoring of the streambank or shoreline shall utilize bioengineering per the integrated streambank protection guidelines 2003 (for riverine shorelines) or the state shorelines guidelines on bank stabilization 2003 (for estuarine and marine shorelines). 
(6)  In an SFHA outside the protected area, zoning is required to maintain a low density of flood plain development. Concepts of cluster development, density transfer, credits and bonuses, planned unit development, and transfer of development rights shall be employed wherever possible. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.150 - Construction within floodways and floodplains restricted. 
Any development occurring in the floodway or floodplain will require the issuance of a "flood hazard permit". A development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard area. The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes, and for all development including fill and other activities as set forth in this chapter. 
(1)  No land use or building permit may be issued for any development within a floodplain until the permit-issuing authority has reviewed the plans for any such development to assure that: 
(A)  The proposed development is consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, and 
(B)  All public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and 
(C)  Adequate drainage is provided to minimize or reduce exposure to flood hazards, and 
(D)  All necessary permits have been received from those agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, and

(F)  The applicant must record a notice on the title that the property contains land within the RHZ and/or one hundred-year floodplain before a permit may be issued, and 
(G)  Any improvements or repairs to existing structures that result in a greater than ten percent increase of the structure footprint must mitigate for any adverse effects, and 
(H)  Removal of native vegetation must leave sixty-five percent of the surface area of the portion of the property in the floodplain in an undeveloped state, and 
(I)  Development in the protected area (floodway, RHZ, and CMZ plus fifty feet) is prohibited unless it is demonstrated that any proposed development in the area does not adversely affect water quality, water quantity, flood volumes, flood velocities, spawning substrate, and/or floodplain refugia for listed salmonids. No mitigation is allowed within the protected area. However, project design elements to avoid any adverse effects may be allowed. 
(2)  Any development outside the protected area must mitigate for adverse effects, both direct and indirect on functions such that equivalent or better salmon habitat protection is provided for: 
(A)  Stormwater. Reduce flood volumes and stormwater runoff from new development by ensuring that increased flood volumes of stormwater reach the river at the same frequency, timing and duration as historic runoff. Low impact development is required to be incorporated as described in Section 20.64.140(b)(2). 
(B)  Riparian vegetation: maintain or replace riparian function by providing equivalent area, diversity, and function of riparian vegetation as currently exists on the site. Riparian retention requirements are outlined in subsection (1)(H). 
(C)  Hyporheic Zones. No activity is allowed that interferes with the natural exchange of flow between surface water, groundwater, and hyporheic zone, however, natural hyporheic exchange may be enhanced or restored. 
(D)  Wetlands. Wetland function must be maintained or replaced by providing equivalent function. 
(E)  Large Woody Debris. Any large woody debris (LWD) removed from the floodplain must be replaced in kind, replicating or improving the quantity, size, and species of the existing LWD. 
(3)  No building may be constructed and no substantial improvement of an existing building may take place within any floodway. This includes a prohibition on installing new mobile homes in an existing mobile home park located in a floodway, even if the park is nonconforming. 
(4)  Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source the applicant shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source (Subsection 20.64.060(b) Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
(5)  No new residential building may be constructed and no substantial improvement of a residential building may take place within any floodplain unless the lowest floor (including basement) of the building or improvement is elevated one foot or more above the base flood level. 
(A)  Residential accessory structures shall be allowed within floodplains provided they are firmly anchored to prevent flotation. 
(B)  Anchoring of any accessory buildings may be done by bolting the building to a concrete slab or by over-the-top ties. When bolting to a concrete slab, one-half inch bolts six feet on center with a minimum of two per side shall be required. If over-the-top ties are used, a minimum of two ties with a force adequate to secure the building is required. 
(6)  No new nonresidential building may be constructed and no substantial improvements of a nonresidential building may take place within any floodplain unless the lowest floor (including basement) of the building or improvement is elevated or floodproofed one foot or more above base flood elevation (BFE). 
(7)  For purposes of this section, "substantial improvement" means for a building constructed prior to the effective date of this title, any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a building the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(A)  Before the improvement or repair is started or 
(B)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" occurs when the first alteration on any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(A)  Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that are solely necessary to insure safe living conditions, or 
(B)  Any alteration of a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places. 
(8)  No land use or building permit may be issued for any development within a floodplain until the permit-issuing authority has reviewed the plans to assure that any new construction or substantial improvements shall be: 
(A)  Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
(B)  Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.170 - Specific standards for zones A1-30, AH, and AE. 
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided (zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM) as set forth in Section 20.64.060 (Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential Construction. 
(A)  New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation. 
(B)  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(i)  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. 
(ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

20.64.180 - Specific standards for designated regulatory floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 20.64.060 (Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for (i) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and (ii) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure either, (A) before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or (B) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the fifty percent. 
(3)  If subsection (1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 20.64.180 through Section 20.64.240. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.190 - Specific standards for shallow flooding areas (AO zones). 
Shallow flooding areas appear on FIRMs as AO Zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures and manufactured homes within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade to the structure, one foot or more above the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade to the structure if no depth number is specified). 
(2)  New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures within AO zones shall either: 
(A)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
(B)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely flood proofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, a registered professional engineer or architect as in Section 20.64.170 (Specific standards for zones A1-30, AH, and AE) shall certify compliance. 
(3)  Require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(4)  Recreational vehicles placed on sites within AO zones on the community's FIRM either: 
(A)  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, 
(B)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
(C)  Meet the requirements of subsections (1) and (3) and the anchoring requirements for manufactured homes (subsection 20.64.160(1), General standards). 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.210 - AE and A1-30 zones with base flood elevations but no floodways. 
In areas with base flood elevations (but where a regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.215 - Special provisions for subdivisions.

(e)  All subdivisions are subject to use and construction restrictions contained in Section 20.64.130 (Artificial obstructions within floodways prohibited), Section 20.64.140 (Permissible uses within floodways), Section 20.64.150 (Construction within floodways and floodplains restricted), and Section 20.64.220 (Utility systems in floodways and floodplains) if any portion of the land to be subdivided lies within a floodway or floodplain. 
(f)  Final plat approval for any subdivision containing land that lies within a floodway or floodplain may not be given unless the plat shows the boundary of the floodway or floodplain and contains in clearly discernible print the following statement: 
"Use of land within a floodway or floodplain is substantially restricted by Title 20, Chapter 20.64 of the Arlington Municipal Code." 
(g)  Subject to the following sentence, a conditional use permit or final plat approval for any subdivision may not be given if: 
(1)  The land to be subdivided lies within a zone where residential uses are permissible and it reasonably appears that the subdivision is designed to create residential building lots, and 
(2)  Any portion of one or more of the proposed lots lies within a floodway or floodplain, and 
(3)  It reasonably appears that one or more lots described in Subsections (g)(1) and (2) could not practicably be used as a residential building site because of the restrictions set forth in Section 20.64.150 (Construction within floodways and floodplains restricted), Section 20.64.160 (General standards), and Section 20.64.170 (Specific standards for zones A1-30, AH, and AE). 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.220 - Utility systems in floodways and floodplains. 
Whenever any portion of a proposed development is located within a floodway or floodplain, the agency or agencies responsible for certifying to the city the adequacy of the utility systems for the development (as set forth in Chapter 20.60) shall be informed by the developer that a specified area within the development lies within a floodway or floodplain. Thereafter, said agency shall certify, prior to approval of the proposed system, that:

(2)  Any proposed water wells are located on high ground that is not in the floodway (WAC 173-160-171); 
(3)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems are designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; and, 
(4)  On-site waste disposal systems are located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(5)  All new utilities would be located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.230 - Critical facility. 
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) (one hundred-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet or to the height of the five hundred-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.240 - Additional duties of administrator related to flood insurance and flood control.

(A)  Obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures including to which level it was floodproofed; and 
(B)  Obtain, for all structures that have been floodproofed (whether or not such structures contain a basement) the elevation (in relation to mean sea level in the FEMA datum) to which the structure was floodproofed; and 
(C)  Maintain the floodproofing certifications found in others sections of this chapter; and 
(D)  The city will track projects which have been issued floodplain development permits, including effects to flood storage and fish habitat and mitigation provided. 
(E)  Maintain a record of all such information for public inspection. 
(2)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, and any effected diking or drainage districts prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator. 
(3)  Ensure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained and within the same sub-basin so carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(4)  Maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(Ord. No. 2016-014, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.64.250 - Variances from requirements. 
(a)  Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (1)—(11) in subsection (i), have been fully considered. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result, or the development may eventually require additional structural flood protection. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  The submittal, review and approval of a biological assessment; 
(3)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
(4)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(f)  Variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. 
(g)  Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (i)(1), and otherwise complies with Subsection 20.64.160(a) General standards), Subsection 20.64.170(2)(c), and Section 20.64.220 (Utility systems in floodways and floodplains). 
(h)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted is hereby notified that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(i)  In granting a variance, in addition to the findings of Section 20.20.030 (Variances), the decision-maker shall consider and make findings concerning all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and (including the degree to which the applicant proposes to mitigated impacts to) the following: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The impact to ESA listed species; 
(4)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(5)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(6)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(7)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(8)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(9)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(10)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, debris and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and, 
(12)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(j)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (b) and the purposes of this chapter, the decision-maker may attach such conditions to the granting of a waiver, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Chapter 20.68 - SIGNS  
Part I. - General Provisions 
 
20.68.010 - Permit required for signs. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 20.68.020 (Signs Excluded From Regulation) and Section 20.68.025 (Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exemptions and Additional Regulations), no sign may be constructed, erected, moved, enlarged, illuminated or substantially altered except in accordance with the provisions of this section. Mere repainting or changing the message of a sign shall not, in and of itself, be considered a substantial alteration. 
(b)  A sign permit may be processed and issued concurrently with a requested zoning, special use, or conditional use permit; however, a separate application is required. 
(c)  Signs not exempted under the provisions referenced in Subsection (a) may be constructed, erected, moved, enlarged, illuminated or substantially altered only in accordance with a sign permit issued by the community development director. 
(d)  Sign permit applications shall be governed by the same provisions of this title applicable to zoning permits (Chapter 20.16, Permits and Final Plat Approval). 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.015 - Master sign programs for multi-tenant sites. 
(a)  In the case of a lot, lots, or single building occupied or intended to be occupied by multiple business enterprises under single property ownership or management (e.g., a shopping center or a multi-tenant building), a master sign program shall be issued in the name of the lot owner or his agent. 
(b)  This master sign program shall address general design standards, design and location(s) of communal signs, and all other issues addressed by this chapter. In particular, the owner shall develop a unifying design theme for the entire site. The city may assist the owner by suggesting a formula whereby the maximum square footage of sign area allowed on the lot may be allocated equitably among all tenants, but the city shall be responsible for enforcing only the provisions of this title and not the provisions of any allocation formula, lease, or other private restriction. 
(c)  Permits for individual businesses shall then be issued in the name of the individual business enterprise requesting a particular sign provided that: (i) they meet the requirements of this chapter, (ii) they conform to the master sign program for the particular property on which they are located, and (iii) the owner of the property or his agent has signed the application acknowledging that he has reviewed the proposal and that it conforms to the master sign program for that particular property. However, once the maximum square footage allotment for the entire property has been reached, no further sign permits may be issued for that property unless other signs are removed or reduced in size.

(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.025 - Certain temporary signs: permit exemptions and additional regulations. 
(a)  The following temporary signs are permitted without a zoning, special use, conditional use, or sign permit. However, such signs shall conform to the requirements set forth below as well as all other applicable requirements of this title except those contained in Section 20.68.130, 230, 330, 430, 530, 630, 730, 830, and 930 (Total Sign Surface Area) and Section 20.68.150(c), 250(b), 450(b), 550(b), 650(b), 750(b), 850(b), and 950(b) (Number of Freestanding Signs). 
(1)  Signs containing the message that the real estate on which the sign is located (including buildings) is for sale, lease, or rent, together with information identifying the owner or agent. In residential zones, such signs may not exceed four square feet in area per side with a maximum of two sides.

(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.030 - Determining the number of signs. 
(a)  No more than one business identification sign affixed to the building may be located on any one side of a building, unless one of the following is true: 
(1)  The building contains individual businesses with separate entrances, in which case each individual business may have one individual sign on as many sides of the building as the individual business maintains a separate business entrance open to the public. 
(2)  The building is larger than fifty thousand square feet and is located in a GC or HC Zone. 
(3)  It's a blade or canopy sign located in the OTBD, GC or HC and meets the following criteria: 
(A)  Maximum size for blade and canopy sign shall be six square feet per side. Sign area shall be calculated based on the sign face containing the graphics with the graphics' background and the structural elements comprising the sign's perimeter shall not include the support brackets. 
(B)  If the blade signs serve as a primary sign and a wall sign is not present, the sign shall project no more than six feet from the building and shall be twelve square feet per side, but shall not include the support brackets. 
(C)  Blade or canopy signs shall maintain a minimum clearance of eight feet above sidewalk level to the bottom of the sign. 
(D)  Blade and canopy signs shall maintain a minimum setback of eighteen inches behind the curb separating the sidewalk from the street parking area. 
(4)  It's a marquee sign located in the OTBD, GC or HC and meets the following criteria: 
(A)  That one marquee sign is permitted for each establishment's façade so long as it is not combined with a wall sign on the same façade. 
(B)  The sign area shall not exceed two hundred square feet or ten percent of the overall façade area, whichever is less. The sign area consists of attached lettering and background if present, but does include the marquee itself (architectural projection that provides a roof-like structure over a pedestrian walkway). 
(b)  A two-sided or multi-sided sign shall be regarded as one sign so long as: 
(1)  With respect to a V-type sign, the two sides are at no point separated by a distance that exceeds five feet; and 
(2)  With respect to double-faced (back-to-back) signs, the distance between the backs of each face of the sign does not exceed three feet. 
(c)  No more than one business identification sign affixed to the building may be located on any one side of a building, unless the building contains individual businesses with separate entrances, in which case one business identification sign per individual business may be located on as many sides as there are separate business entrances. 
(Ord. No. 1454, § 11, 9-26-2008; Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.035 - Computation of sign area. 
(a)  The surface area of a sign shall be computed by including the entire area within a single, continuous, rectilinear perimeter of not more than eight straight lines, or a circle or an ellipse, enclosing the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself, or not including those non-sign portions of a structure that serves a non-signage function (such as an awning or canopy), even though the color may be the same as the background of the sign. 
(b)  If the sign consists of more than one section or module, all of the area, including that between sections or modules, shall be included in the computation of the sign area. 
(c)  With respect to two-sided, multi-sided, or three-dimensional signs, the sign surface area shall be computed by including the total of all sides designed to attract attention or communicate information that can be seen at any one time by a person from any vantage point. Without otherwise limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
(1)  The sign surface area of a double faced, back to back sign shall be calculated by using the area of only one side of such sign, so long as the distance between the backs of such signs does not exceed three feet; 
(2)  The sign surface area of a double faced sign constructed in the form of a "V" shall be calculated by using the area of only one side of such sign (the larger side if there is a size difference), so long as the angle of the "V" does not exceed thirty degrees and at no point does the distance between the backs of such sides exceed five feet. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.040 - Signs projecting into or over public rights-of-way. 
(a)  No sign or supporting structure may be located in or over any portion of a public right-of-way traveled by motor vehicles unless the sign is attached to a structural element of a building, all portions of the sign are higher than fifteen feet above the right-of-way surface, and an encroachment permit has been obtained from the city. 
(b)  Hanging, marquee, canopy, or projecting signs may be located on or above sidewalks upon meeting the following requirements: 
(1)  The sign must be attached to a structural element of a building; 
(2)  An encroachment permit must be obtained from the city if placed over a public right-of-way; 
(3)  No portion of the sign or supporting structure may hang or protrude below eight feet above the sidewalk; 
(4)  No sign may project closer than two feet from the curb line of a street; 
(5)  Only one hanging, marquee, canopy, or projecting sign is allowed for each main entry. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.045 - Miscellaneous restrictions and prohibitions. 
(a)  As provided in Section 20.40.010, the Table of Permissible Uses (use classification 27.000), no off-premises signs may be located in any district except: 
(1)  Those exempted from regulation or from permit requirements under Section 20.68.020 (Signs Excluded From Regulation) or Section 20.68.025, 120, 220, 320, 420, 520, 620, 720, 820, and 920 (Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exemptions and Additional Regulations); 
(2)  City-sponsored "City Center/ Welcome" signs indicating the location of downtown and general types of businesses and services found there may be placed at the main entries to the city; and, 
(3)  Public service signs. 
(b)  No sign may be located so that it substantially interferes with the view necessary for motorists to proceed safely through intersections or to enter onto or exit from public streets or private roads. Specifically, freestanding and portable signs may not be placed within a vehicular sight distance triangle at the intersection of any streets. This triangle connects the intersection of the paved or traveled surface of the roadways with each of the two points measured thirty feet from the intersection along the edge of the respective paved or traveled surface of each roadway. 
(c)  Signs that revolve or are animated or that use movement or apparent movement to attract the attention of the public are prohibited. Without limiting the foregoing, banners, streamers, animated display boards, pennants, and propellers are prohibited, but signs that only move occasionally because of wind are not prohibited if their movement (i) is not a primary design feature of the sign, and (ii) is not intended to attract attention to the sign. The restriction of this subsection shall not apply to barber poles or signs specified in Subsection 20.68.025(a)(4) (Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exemptions and Additional Regulations). 
(d)  No sign may be erected so that by its location, color, size, shape, nature, or message it would tend to obstruct the view of or be confused with official traffic signs or other signs erected by governmental agencies. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.050 - Incentive provisions for exceptional efforts. 
(a)  To encourage the integration of signage into the visual framework of its location, special consideration may be given to signs of exceptional design. Such special consideration may, in some cases, result in a relaxation of the dimensional and locational standards specified in this chapter. Such a relaxation of standards is not to be confused with a variance. Rather, the relaxation is to be based on an exceptional effort toward creating visual harmony between the sign, the building(s), and the site where it is to be located through the use of exceptional design. 
(b)  The design review board shall consider petitions for signs of exceptional design. Said petitions shall be submitted with the standard sign permit application. The petition and application shall be presented to the design review board with a narrative outlining the proposed plan addressing, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  How the physical components of the sign address legibility, visibility, readability, and aesthetics in relation to traffic speed, color combinations, sign placement, etc.; 
(2)  The relationship of the proposed sign to the community vision for the zone, as expressed in the comprehensive plan, intent of the zone, and development design guidelines. In the Old Town Business District in particular, signs designed to enhance the historic character of downtown may be given special consideration; 
(3)  Relationship of the sign to the immediate surroundings, including existing and proposed buildings, other signs, and landscape; 
(4)  Relationship of the sign to the business that the sign is to promote; and, 
(5)  A colored rendering, showing the proposed sign, dimensions of the sign, and location of the sign. 
(c)  After considering the foregoing issues, the design review board, at its discretion, may allow relaxation of the dimensional and locational standards of this chapter by up to twenty percent if the board finds that relaxation of those standards would better serve the public interest than would strict adherence to those standards, and lead to a better and more aesthetically pleasing sign. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.055 - Maintenance of signs. 
(a)  All signs and all components thereof, including without limitation supports, braces, and anchors, shall be kept clean and in a state of good repair. With respect to freestanding signs, components (supporting structures, backs, etc.) not bearing a message shall be constructed of materials that blend with the natural environment or shall be painted a neutral color to blend with the surrounding environment. 
(b)  If a sign advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other party having control over such sign. 
(c)  If the message portion of a sign is removed, leaving only the supporting "shell" of a sign or the supporting braces, anchors, or similar components, the owner of the sign or the owner of the property where the sign is located or other person having control over such sign shall, within thirty days of the removal of the message portion of the sign, either replace the entire message portion of the sign, install a "blank" sign facing, or remove the remaining components of the sign. In cases where a blank sign facing is temporarily installed, said facing shall be in place for no longer than twelve months, after which all components must be removed. This subsection shall not be construed to alter the effect of Subsection 20.68.065(c) Nonconforming Signs), which prohibits the replacement of a nonconforming sign. Nor shall this subsection be construed to prevent the changing of the message of a sign. 
(d)  The area within ten feet in all directions of any part of a freestanding sign shall be kept clear of all debris and all undergrowth more than five inches in height. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.060 - Unlawful cutting of trees or shrubs. 
No person may, for the purpose of increasing or enhancing the visibility of any sign, damage, trim, destroy, or remove any trees, shrubs, or other vegetation located: 
(1)  Within the right-of-way of any public street or road, unless the work is done pursuant to the express written authorization of the community development director; 
(2)  On property that is not under the ownership or control of the person doing or responsible for such work, unless the work is done pursuant to the express authorization of the person owning the property where such trees or shrubs are located; 
(3)  In any area where such trees or shrubs are required to remain under a permit issued under this title; 
(4)  In any area encumbered by a native growth protection easement or similar easement prohibiting the removal of trees or vegetation. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.065 - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Subject to the remaining restrictions of this section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this chapter may be continued. 
(b)  No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in such a manner as to aggravate the nonconforming condition. Nor may illumination be added to any nonconforming sign. 
(c)  A nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this title. 
(d)  If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this title, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land. For purposes of this section, a nonconforming sign is "destroyed" if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing the sign to its former stature or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign so damaged. 
(e)  The message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformities (for example, by creating an off-premise sign under circumstances where such a sign would not be allowed). 
(f)  Subject to the other provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any twelve-month period fifty percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such sign. 
(g)  If a nonconforming sign other than a billboard advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be considered abandoned and shall be removed in compliance with Section 20.68.055 (Maintenance of Signs). 
(h)  If a nonconforming billboard remains blank for a continuous period of one hundred eighty days, that billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within thirty days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with this chapter or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of this section, a sign is "blank" if: 
(1)  It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; or 
(2)  The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part; or 
(3)  The advertising copy paid for by a party other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign has been removed. 
(i)  The burden of establishing a sign to be legally nonconforming or not destroyed under this section rests upon the person or persons, firm, or corporation claiming legal status for a sign. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.070 - Illegal signs. 
(a)  Any sign that was erected between January 1, 1990, until present and has not received a lawful sign permit is hereby considered an illegal sign and shall obtain a permit within one year of this chapter's effective date. If a sign is illegal and nonconforming it shall be brought into conformance with the regulations contained herein. 
(b)  The burden of establishing a sign to be legal under this section rests upon the person or persons, firm, or corporation claiming legal status for a sign. 
(c)  If a permit is not obtained within the one-year period granted in Subsection (a) then the city may initiate enforcement procedures pursuant to Chapter 20.48 (Enforcement and Review) or AMC Title 11. 
(Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
Part II. - Residential Districts 
 
20.68.110 - Applicability. 
(a)  This Part applies to all signs in the SR, RLMD, RMD, OTR, and RHD Zones. 
(b)  All regulations of Part 1 (General Provisions) of this chapter shall apply. 
(Ord. 1393 § 13, 2006; Ord. 1314 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.68.120 - Certain temporary signs in single-family residential districts: permit exemptions and additional regulations. 
(a)  In addition to the exemptions and regulations of Section 20.68.025 (Certain Temporary Signs: Permit Exemptions and Additional Regulations), the following shall also pertain in the SR, RLMD, RMD, OT, and RHD Zones: 
(1)  Temporary signs not covered in the categories listed in Section 20.68.025, so long as such signs meet the following restrictions: 
(A)  Not more than one such sign may be located on any lot.

20.72.020 - Flexibility in administration required. 
(a)  The council recognizes that, due to the particularities of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in Subsection 20.72.010(f) (Table of Parking Requirements) may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. The latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space. Therefore, as suggested in Section 20.72.010 (Number of Parking Spaces Required), the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Subsection 20.72.010(f) (Table of Parking Requirements) and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Subsection 20.72.010(a). 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the permit-issuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Subsection 20.72.010(f) (Table of Parking Requirements) when it finds that: 
(1)  A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly or other demographic group that, due to the driving characteristics of the group, requires fewer or more parking stalls than the general populace; or, 
(2)  A sole business (not part of a larger mall) is primarily oriented to walk-in trade. 
(c)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in Subsection 20.72.010(f) (Table of Parking Requirements), it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation. 
(d)  If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that the presumption established by Subsection 20.72.010(f) (Table of Parking Requirements) for a particular use classification is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Parking Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 20.96 (Amendments). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.030 - Parking space dimensions. 
(a)  Subject to subsection (b), and except accessible parking spaces as per Section 20.72.064 (accessible parking spaces), each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least nineteen feet long and nine feet wide. Lines separating parking spaces may be drawn at various angles in relation to curbs or aisles, so long as the parking spaces so created contain within them the rectangular area required by this section. In parking areas containing ten or more parking spaces, twenty percent of the parking spaces may contain a rectangular area of only eight feet in width by fifteen feet in length. If such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved for small or compact cars only. When feasible parking stalls shall be provided for motorcycles and electric cars. 
(b)  Wherever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twenty-two feet by eight feet.

(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 11, 10-19-2015)  
20.72.040 - Required widths of parking area aisles and driveways. 
(a)  Drive aisle widths shall conform to Table 20.72-2, Drive Aisle Widths, which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking. 
(b)  [Table 20.72-2—Parking aisle widths.]

(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 12, 10-19-2015)  
20.72.050 - General design requirements. 
(a)  Unless no other practicable alternative is available, parking areas shall be designed so that, without resorting to extraordinary movements, vehicles may exit such areas without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two dwelling units, although backing onto arterial streets is discouraged. 
(b)  Parking areas of all developments shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can serve such developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making other dangerous or hazardous turning movements. 
(c)  Every parking area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Such areas shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation, or other obstruction. However, in order to reduce total impervious surfaces parking spaces may be designed so that vehicles overhang perimeter landscape areas, and the overhang, though landscaped, may count toward the parking space dimension required by Section 20.72.030 (Parking Space Dimensions) except that that portion of the landscaped area may not count toward the landscape or screening requirements referenced in Subsection (e). Such landscaped area shall be planted with appropriate materials such that vehicles do not cause damage to the landscaping, nor vice-versa. 
(d)  Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or other vehicles and without interfering with parking areas. 
(e)  Other requirements affecting the design can be found in Section 20.76.124 (Shade Trees on Lots), Section 20.76.030 (Compliance With Screening Standard) and Section 20.76.130 (Shade Trees in Parking Areas). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.060 - Parking area surfaces. 
(a)  All parking areas shall be graded and surfaced with asphalt, concrete or other material that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion, and dust. Specifications for surfaces meeting the standard set forth in this subsection are contained in the Public Works Construction Standards and Specifications. 
(b)  Parking spaces shall be appropriately demarcated with painted lines or other markings. 
(c)  Parking areas shall be properly maintained in all respects. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, parking area surfaces shall be kept in good condition (free from potholes, etc.) and parking space lines or markings shall be kept clearly visible and distinct. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.064 - Accessible parking spaces. 
(a)  Handicap Standards: All handicapped parking spaces shall be designed in accordance with the following standards: American National Standard Institute, Inc. Standards for Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible To and Useable By Physically Handicapped People (ANSI A117.1-1980) and Parking Consultants Council, National Parking Association, Recommended Standards for Designing Parking Facilities for Physically Handicapped People (1988). 
(b)  Number: The number of handicapped parking spaces to be provided in any lot or facility shall be according to the current state standard. Accessible parking spaces shall not be required in mechanical or valet/attendant park facilities except that a minimum of one accessible space shall be provided to allow the owner/driver of a vehicle with special hand or other controls to park the vehicle. The designation of handicapped parking stalls shall constitute consent by the property owner to the enforcement of the restriction of such spaces to handicapped users by the city. 
(c)  Size: Parking spaces for disabled people shall be at least eight feet - zero inches wide and shall have an adjacent access aisle at least five feet - zero inches wide. A single space thirteen feet - zero inches wide may also be provided. Parking access aisles when a part of the accessible route to the building or facility entrance shall comply with Section 4.3 of ANSI A117.1-1980. Two adjacent accessible parking spaces may share a common access aisle only if a vehicle can reasonably back into a space to ensure that the access aisle is on the preferred side or if the space may be reasonably used by handicapped vans. Parked vehicle overhangs shall not reduce the clear width of an accessible route. Specific conditions as established in state code may require modifications of these standards to ensure compliance. 
(d)  Signage: A sign displaying the symbol of accessibility, the restriction to use by permit-holders and the fine for violation shall be provided at each handicapped stall in accordance with state law. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.070 - Joint use of required parking spaces. 
(a)  One parking area may contain required spaces for several different uses, but except as otherwise provided in this section, the required space assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use. 
(b)  To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on Monday through Friday but is generally ninety percent vacant on weekends, another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with ninety percent of the spaces on that lot. Alternatively, if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to fifty percent of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make use of fifty percent of the church lot's spaces on those other days. 
(c)  The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present a contract as evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces. These documents shall be recorded with the Snohomish County auditor. 
(d)  If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of Section 20.72.080 (Satellite Parking) are also applicable. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.080 - Satellite parking. 
(a)  If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this title cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot where the principal use associated with these parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with the provisions of this section. These off-site spaces are referred to in this section as satellite parking spaces. 
(b)  All such satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee use) must be located within four hundred feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking, or within four hundred feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building. Satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance. 
(c)  The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present a contract as evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces. The developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces. These documents shall be recorded with the Snohomish County auditor. 
(d)  Persons who obtain satellite parking spaces in accordance with this section shall not be held accountable for ensuring that the satellite parking areas from which they obtain their spaces satisfy the design requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.082 - Tandem parking. 
(a)  Tandem parking—Where one vehicle is parked in front of another and effectively blocked from moving without first moving the other—Is permissible for non-residential uses only where valet parking is provided. In the case where valet parking is provided and tandem parking approved, it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that should the valet parking discontinue then the permit-holder is obligated to provide the parking required pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  For residential uses, Subsection (a) shall be interpreted to mean that driveways leading to a garage cannot be counted toward the required parking spaces. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.084 - Reductions in parking space requirements for provision of alternative transportation. 
(a)  Transit: Subject to Section 20.72.086 (Maximum Cumulative Reduction of Required Parking Spaces), a reduction of up to ten percent of the required parking spaces may be granted for any use, building or complex other than for convenience or retail use categories located within four hundred feet of any stop on a regularly scheduled transit route. The reduction in parking space supply applicable to the provision of transit services may be further modified by conditions in any community, as these may be reviewed and reported by a qualified parking consultant or by the responsible official at his or her discretion. 
(b)  Car Pooling/Van Pooling: Subject to Section 20.72.086 (Maximum Cumulative Reduction of Required Parking Spaces), a reduction of up to ten percent of required parking, based on substantiated projections of reduction in parking demand, may be granted for any building or use exceeding fifty thousand square feet GLA that institutes and maintains a locally approved carpooling/vanpooling program. Such reduction may be terminated immediately upon failure of the owner, operator, tenant, or others responsible for such programs to maintain such programs in an ongoing and acceptable manner. 
(c)  Shuttle Service: Subject to Section 20.72.086 (Maximum Cumulative Reduction of Required Parking Spaces), a reduction of up to fifteen percent of required parking, based on substantiated projections of reduction in parking demand, may be granted for any building or use that institutes and maintains a continuous, personalized shuttle service. Said reduction may be terminated immediately upon failure of the owner, operator, tenant or others responsible for such program to maintain such program in an ongoing and acceptable manner. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.086 - Maximum cumulative reduction of required parking spaces. 
Reduction in the total number of required parking spaces granted for the provision of alternative transportation services (Section 20.72.084, Reductions in Parking Space Requirements for Provision of Alternative Transportation) or for protecting significant trees (Section 20.76.120(g) (Retention and Protection of Significant Trees) shall not exceed a total of thirty percent. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.090 - Special provisions for lots with existing buildings. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, whenever (i) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this title, and (ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (iii) such change in use does not require more parking spaces than the previous use, and (iv) the parking requirements of Section 20.72.010 (Number of Parking Spaces Required) that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking, then the developer need only comply with the requirements of Section 20.72.010 to the extent that (i) parking space is practicably available on the lot where the development is located, and (ii) satellite parking space is reasonably available as provided in Section 20.72.070 (Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces). However, if satellite parking subsequently becomes reasonably available, then it shall be a continuing condition of the permit authorizing development on such lot that the developer obtain satellite parking when it does become available. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.72.100 - Loading and unloading areas. 
(a)  Subject to Subsection (e), and except in the CBD-1 District, whenever the normal operation of any development requires that goods, merchandise, or equipment be routinely delivered to or shipped from that development, a sufficient off-street loading and unloading area must be provided in accordance with this section to accommodate the delivery or shipment operations in a safe and convenient manner. 
(b)  The loading and unloading area must be of sufficient size to accommodate the numbers and types of vehicles that are likely to use this area, given the nature of the development in question. Table 20.72-3: Loading Area Requirements indicates the number and size of spaces that, presumptively, satisfy the standard set forth in this subsection. However, the permit-issuing authority may require more or less loading and unloading area if reasonably necessary to satisfy the foregoing standard. 
(c)  Loading and unloading areas shall be so located and designed that the vehicles intended to use them can (i) maneuver safely and conveniently to and from a public right-of-way, and (ii) complete the loading and unloading operations without obstructing or interfering with any public right-of-way or—unless properly managed (e.g., night deliveries only)—any parking space or parking lot aisle. 
(d)  No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for loading and unloading facilities unless the delivery operations are managed so as to preclude conflicts with automobiles (e.g., night deliveries only) or unless additional parking spaces beyond those required are provided and used as such temporarily. 
(e)  Whenever (i) there exists a lot with one or more structures on it constructed before the effective date of this title, and (ii) a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot, and (iii) such change in use does not require more parking spaces than the previous use, and (iv) the loading area requirements of this section cannot be satisfied because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for loading and unloading, then the developer need only comply with this section to the extent reasonably possible.

(a)  All multi-family uses in excess of four units shall provide parking facilities for bicycles at a ratio of one "stall" per every ten required parking spaces. 
(b)  Except in the Old Town Business District 1, where bicycle parking facilities are anticipated to be provided as part of public/private redevelopment projects, all commercial and public uses shall provide "stalls" for bicycles at a ratio of ten percent of the required automobile parking spaces required for a business or group of businesses. After twenty "stalls" have been provided by any business or group of businesses, the ratio shall be five percent of the total required automobile parking spaces. 
(c)  A bicycle "stall" shall include a delineated and safe parking area, and an appropriate structure to which bicycles can be locked. 
(d)  The permit-issuing authority may reduce the above requirements if they can be shown to be unwarranted.

Chapter 20.76 - SCREENING AND TREES  
Part I. - Screening 
 
20.76.010 - Council findings concerning the need for screening requirements. 
(a)  The council finds that: 
(1)  Screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise, dust, and glare. 
(2)  Screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area. Even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces, and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use. 
(3)  Screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening. 
(4)  The provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.020 - General screening standard. 
(a)  Every development shall provide sufficient screening so that: 
(1)  Neighboring properties are shielded from any adverse external effects of that development; 
(2)  The development is shielded from the negative impacts of adjacent uses such as streets or railroads. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.030 - Compliance with screening standard. 
(a)  Except as modified per Section 20.76.090 (Special Screening Requirements), the table set forth in Section 20.76.050 (Table of Screening Requirements), in conjunction with the explanations in 20.76.040 (Descriptions of Screens) concerning the types of screens, establishes screening requirements that presumptively satisfy the general standards established in Section 20.76.020 (General Screening Standard). However, this table is only intended to establish a presumption and should be flexibly administered in accordance with Section 20.76.060 (Flexibility in Administration Required). 
(b)  The numerical designations contained in the Table of Screening Requirements (Section 20.76.050) are keyed to the Table of Permissible Uses (Section 20.40.010), and the letter designations refer to types of screening as described in Section 20.76.040 (Descriptions of Screens). This table indicates the type of screening that is presumptively required between two uses. Where such screening is required, only the property under application for development is responsible for installing the screening. The use assigned this responsibility is referred to as the burdened use in Section 20.76.050 (Table of Screening Requirements), and the other use is the benefited use. 
To determine the type of screening a proposed new development must install, begin under the burdened column with the use classification number of the proposed use and follow that line across the page to its intersection with the use classification number of each use that adjoins the property to be developed. For each intersecting square that contains a letter, the developer must install the level of screening indicated along this portion bordering that use. 
(c)  If, when the analysis described in Subsection (b) is performed, the burdened use is an existing use but the required screening is not in place, then this lack of screening shall constitute a nonconforming situation, subject to all the provisions of Chapter 20.32 (Nonconforming Situations) of this Title. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a multi-family development shall be required, at the time of construction, to install any screening that is required between it and adjacent existing uses according to the table set forth in Section 20.76.050 (Table of Screening Requirements). 
(e)  Developments in the Old Town Business Districts 1, 2, and 3 shall be exempt from the screening requirements of Section 20.76.050 (Table of Screening Requirements) pertaining to screening along streets where the buildings abut the sidewalk.

The following three basic types of screens are hereby established and are used as the basis for the table of screening requirements set forth in Section 20.76.050 (table of screening requirements). 
(1)  Opaque Screen, Type A. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of at least six feet, with intermittent visual obstructions from the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty feet. The width shall be a minimum of five feet wide, but may be increased if, in the opinion of the permit-issuing authority, it is needed to better insulate or isolate uses; and in all cases be a minimum of ten feet along street frontages where required. An opaque screen is intended to exclude all visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, native vegetation, drought-tolerant vegetation, vegetated LID facilities, or existing vegetation. Compliance of vegetative screens or native vegetation will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The opaque portion of the screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The portion of intermittent visual obstructions may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in the department of public works' construction standards and specifications. 
(2)  Semi-Opaque Screen, Type B. A screen that is opaque from the ground to a height of three feet, with intermittent visual obstruction from above the opaque portion to a height of at least twenty feet. The width shall be a minimum of five feet wide, but may be increased if, in the opinion of the permit-issuing authority, it is needed to better insulate or isolate uses; and in all cases be a minimum of ten feet along street frontages where required. The semi-opaque screen is intended to partially block visual contact between uses and to create a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The semi-opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence, landscaped earth berm, native vegetation, drought-tolerant vegetation, vegetated LID facilities, or existing vegetation. Compliance of vegetative screens or native vegetation will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The zone of intermittent visual obstruction may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in the department of public works' construction standards and specifications. 
(3)  Intermittent Screen, Type C. A screen composed of intermittent visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least twenty feet. The width shall be a minimum of five feet wide, but may be increased if, in the opinion of the permit-issuing authority, it is needed to better insulate or isolate uses; and in all cases be a minimum of ten feet along street frontages where required. The intermittent screen is intended to create the impression of a separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces. It may be composed of native vegetation or existing vegetation. Compliance of vegetative screens or native vegetation will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. At maturity, the portion of intermittent visual obstructions should not contain any completely unobstructed openings more than ten feet wide. The screen may contain deciduous plants. Suggested planting patterns that will achieve this standard are included in department of public works' construction standards and specifications.

(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 13, 10-19-2015)  
20.76.050 - Table of screening requirements. 
See Table 20.76-10: Screening Requirements. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.060 - Flexibility in administration required. 
(a)  The council recognizes that because of the wide variety of types of developments and the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish inflexible screening requirements. Therefore, as provided in Section 20.76.030 Compliance With Screening Standard, the permit-issuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of Section 20.76.050 (Table of Screening Requirements) and may either require more intensive or allow less intensive screening whenever it finds such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 20.76.020 (General Screening Standard) without imposing unnecessary costs on the developer. 
(b)  Without limiting the generality of Subsection (a), the permit-issuing authority may modify the presumptive requirements for: 
(1)  Non-residential developments located adjacent to nonconforming residential uses in non-residential zoning districts, 
(2)  Non-residential uses located adjacent to other similar uses within the same zoning district, 
(3)  Any development where it is found that the presumptive requirement would cause a nuisance or sight distance problem. 
(4)  Where Type A screening is required along a street, if the office or other similar non-intensive portion of the use is placed between the street and the intensive portion of the use, then only Type B screening is necessary between that non-intensive portion and the street. 
(5)  Whenever a building is located adjacent to or within five feet of a street right-of-way, as encouraged by the Development Design Guidelines, and the applicant includes windows intended to provide pedestrian visibility into the establishment, then the screening requirement may be modified by requiring only low growing vegetation so as not to block such visibility. 
(c)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive requirements set forth in Section 20.76.050 Table of Screening Requirements, it shall enter on the face of the permit the screening requirement that it imposes to meet the standard set forth in Section 20.76.020 General Screening Standard and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation. 
(d)  If the permit-issuing authority concludes, based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal, that a presumption established by Section 20.76.050 Table of Screening Requirements is erroneous, it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the Table of Screening Requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 20.96, Amendments. 
(Ord. 1351, § 10, 2004; Ord. No. 1312, § 22, 11-17-2003; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.070 - Combination uses. 
(a)  In determining the screening requirements that apply between a combination use and another use, the permit-issuing authority shall proceed as if the principal uses that comprise the combination use were not combined and reach its determination accordingly, relying on the table set forth in Section 20.76.050 (Table of Screening Requirements) interpreted in the light of Section 20.76.060 (Flexibility in Administration Required). The developer shall be required to install the strictest form of screening required by any one of these principal uses. 
(b)  When two or more principal uses are combined to create a combination use, screening shall not be required between the component principal uses unless they are clearly separated physically and screening is determined to be necessary to satisfy the standard set forth in Section 20.76.020 (General Screening Standard). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.080 - Subdivisions. 
(a)  When non-residential, undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold, the subdivider shall not be required to install any screening. Screening shall be required, if at all, only when the lots are developed, and the responsibility for installing such screening shall be determined in accordance with the other requirements of Part I of this chapter. 
(b)  When residential, undeveloped land is subdivided and undeveloped lots only are sold, the subdivider shall be required to install any perimeter screening required. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.090 - Special screening requirements. 
(a)  Due to the potential for significantly worse adverse impacts between the following non-compatible uses, in addition to the other requirements of this chapter a thirty-foot wide landscaped screen shall be maintained along common boundaries between the below listed districts or uses. 
(1)  All uses within all residential and industrial zoning districts adjacent to Interstate 5, State Route 9, State Route 530, and State Route 531 east of 67 th Avenue NE shall maintain said screen along said roads. 
(2)  Wherever any non-residential zoning district abuts a residential zoning district, all uses within the non-residential district shall maintain said screen along common boundaries. For the purposes of this section, where a road separates the zoning districts, the properties are not considered to abut. 
(b)  The screen shall consist of visual obstructions from the ground to a height of at least thirty feet at maturity; including evergreen trees planted at least three deep. This screen is intended to minimize all visual and noise contact between uses and to create a strong impression of visual separation. The screen may be composed of planted or existing vegetation, and the retention of existing significant trees that are not prone to windthrow is strongly encouraged. Compliance of planted or natural vegetative screens will be judged based on the average mature height and density of foliage of the subject species, or field observation of existing vegetation. The screen must be opaque in all seasons of the year. At maturity, there should not be any unobstructed openings to a height of ten feet. 
(c)  The permit-issuing authority may approve averaging of buffer widths to prevent denial of all reasonable use of property.

Part II. - Shading 
 
20.76.100 - Council findings and declaration of policy on shade trees. 
(a)  The council finds that: 
(1)  Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for human survival, 
(2)  Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe, 
(3)  Trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air-washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems, 
(4)  Trees have an important role in neutralizing stormwater passing through the ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers, 
(5)  Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, and flood control, 
(6)  Trees are an invaluable physical, aesthetic, and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting, making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land, particularly parking areas, and 
(7)  For the reasons indicated in Subsection (6), trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values. 
(b)  Based upon the findings set forth in Subsection (a), the council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health, safety, and welfare of all persons living or working within the city's planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and, under the circumstances set forth in this chapter, to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.110 - Required trees along dedicated streets. 
Along both sides of all newly created, widened, or improved streets that are constructed in accordance with the public street standards set forth in Chapter 20.56 (Streets and Sidewalks), the developer shall either plant or retain sufficient trees so that within the landscape strip there is for every thirty feet of street frontage at least an average of one deciduous tree of two inches dbh at the time of planting and with a canopy that starts at least eight feet above finished grade and has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least eight inches in diameter. Root barriers shall be provided for all street trees and the landscape strip shall be planted per the Department of Public Works' Standards and Specifications. It is a violation of this title to pave or cover the landscape strip with impervious material or to park motor vehicles on this strip. When the developer plants trees pursuant to this section, the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the Department of Public Works' Design Standards and Specifications. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.112 - Protection of street trees. 
Unless specifically authorized by the city's responsible official, no person shall damage any street tree, attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance to any street tree; allow any gaseous, liquid or solid substance which is harmful to trees to come into contact with them; set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any street tree; excavate any ditches, tunnels, trenches or lay any drive within a radius of ten feet of any street tree; deposit place or store any materials which may impede the free passage of water and fertilizer to the roots of any street tree. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.120 - Retention and protection of significant trees. 
(a)  Every development shall retain all existing significant trees and significant stands of trees, with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of at least eight inches for deciduous trees and at least twelve inches dbh for evergreen trees, unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development or in the opinion of the permit-issuing authority cause a significant safety problem. 
(b)  No excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the critical root zone (CRZ) where feasible, which may extend outside of the drip line of existing tree branches, of any of the trees regulated by subsection (a), and, except for street trees, no impervious surface (including, but not limited to, paving or buildings) may be located within twelve and one-half feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of any tree eighteen inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development. For purposes of this subsection, a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground. 
(c)  The retention or protection of significant trees and significant stands of trees as provided in subsections (a) and (b) unreasonably burdens a development if, to accomplish such retention or protection, the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer. 
(d)  When significant trees or significant stands of trees are present on a site for which a land use permit is submitted, the applicant shall provide a tree survey, showing size, type, and location of all significant trees and stands of trees. Critical root zones shall be fenced prior to construction with orange plastic mesh fencing or approved equivalent. Any significant trees removed because their retention would unreasonably burden a development shall be replaced with five-gallon-sized native species at a ratio of three to one. If the replacement trees are to be planted on building lots, the developer shall provide adequate protection from damage during construction, or planting shall occur after construction, in which case a planting plan and security shall be provided to ensure their planting. 
(e)  If it is physically impossible to replant all replacement trees on-site, then the applicant may mitigate the loss of trees by either planting trees on public property within the city as approved by the community development director, and/or paying a mitigation fee into the city's tree mitigation in-lieu fund. This fee shall be set forth in the city's fee resolution, and equal the cost of the trees and planting labor. 
(f)  If any significant tree identified to be protected pursuant to this section is removed or damaged to the extent that its ability to survive is seriously threatened, without the city's prior written consent, the loss shall be remedied pursuant to Section 20.28.040(c) (penalties and remedies for violations), with the understanding that each tree so removed or damaged shall be counted as a separate violation. 
(g)  If space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsections (a) or (b), and, as a result, the parking requirements set forth in Chapter 20.72 (Parking) cannot be satisfied, the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces "lost" because of the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), up to a maximum of fifteen percent of the required spaces. 
(Ord. 1392 § 12, 2006; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003) 
(Ord. No. 2015-025, § 14, 10-19-2015)  
20.76.124 - Shade trees on lots. 
(a)  Each new or existing lot within the city shall maintain a minimum number of trees on-site, as specified in Subsection (b). This section shall be enforced at the time that any land use or building permit is issued. If fewer than the required trees exist on a lot for which a land use or building permit is applied, the granting of the permit shall be conditioned on the planting of trees to meet the requirements of this section. 
(b)  The minimum number of required trees depends on the Zoning District in which the site falls, as follows: 
(1)  Suburban Residential, Residential-Low/Moderate Density, Residential Moderate Density, and Old Town - two trees per lot. 
(2)  All other zoning districts—The tree requirement is satisfied by compliance with Section 20.76.020 (General Screening Standard), Section 20.76.090 (Special Screening Requirements), Section 20.76.110 (Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets), and Section 20.76.130 (Shade Trees in Parking Areas). 
(c)  If street trees are present, or are required to be installed as part of a development or building permit, said street trees may count toward one of the trees required by Subsection (b). 
(d)  Non street trees required per this section shall be a native species, have a minimum 1.5-inch diameter at breast height (dbh), and attain a minimum height of twenty-five feet at maturity. Standards for street trees are found in Section 20.76.110 (Required Trees Along Dedicated Streets). 
(e)  At least one of the required trees should be planted near the rear property line of the lot. The intent of this regulation is to create rows of trees behind and between rows of houses, thus affording privacy and creating a forested view of the community when seen from ground level. 
(f)  The permit-issuing authority may relax or waive the requirements of this section if it can be demonstrated that the intent of the section is met through existing vegetation, that placement of trees on the site is physically unfeasible, or for valid urban forest management reasons. 
(Ord. 1411 § 6, 2007: Ord. 1393 § 19, 2006; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.76.130 - Shade trees in parking areas. 
(a)  Vehicle accommodation areas that are required to be paved by Section 20.72.060 (Parking Area Surfaces) must be shaded by deciduous trees (either retained or planted by the developer) that have or will have when fully mature a trunk at least eight inches in diameter. When the developer plants trees to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the Department of Public Works' Design Standards and Specifications. 
(b)  Each tree of the type described in Subsection (a) shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of fifteen feet with the trunk of the tree as the center, and there must be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, twenty percent of the vehicle accommodation area will be shaded. 
(c)  Except as noted in Subsection (d), no paving may be placed within two and one-half feet (measured from the center of the trunk) of any tree retained to comply with Subsection (a), and new trees planted to comply with Subsection (a) shall be located so that they are surrounded by at least two hundred square feet of unpaved area. 
(d)  Pervious paving (grasscrete, metal grating, etc.) may be used within two and one-half feet of a tree if (i) the parking lot is designed so that no significant run-off from the paved areas drains into the area around the base of the tree(s) and (ii) barriers are placed in such a manner as to prevent vehicles from damaging such trees. 
(e)  Vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking trees. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three feet, six inches. 
(f)  Vegetation shall be planted and maintained to prevent obstruction of driver visibility of pedestrians and other vehicles.

Part III. - Maintenance 
 
20.76.140 - Maintenance of screening and shading elements. 
All screening and shading elements required by this chapter shall be maintained by the owner for the life of the project to the following standard: 
(1)  All plant material shall be maintained with respect to pruning, trimming, mowing, watering, insect control, and fertilizing to maintain a healthy growing condition, create an attractive appearance, and to accomplish the purpose for which it was required. 
(2)  Dead, diseased, stolen, vandalized, or damaged plants shall be replaced within three months with the plants indicated on the approved landscape plan. 
(3)  All screening and shading elements shall be maintained reasonably free of weeds and trash. 
(4)  All screening and shading elements located within public rights-of-way shall be maintained by the abutting property owner. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
Chapter 20.80 - FOREST LAND CONVERSION  
Part I. - General Provisions 
 
20.80.010 - Authority. 
This chapter is adopted pursuant to RCW 76.09 and WAC 222-20. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.80.020 - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this chapter is to assume regulatory authority from the Washington Department of Natural Resources over certain forest practices specified in Section 20.80.050 (Applicability) as permitted by Washington state law. This chapter assures that the forest practices and activities described in Section 20.80.050 (Applicability) occur in compliance with the Arlington Comprehensive Plan and other applicable development regulations, including but not limited to: 
(1)  AMC Title 13 (Water, Sewer, and Stormwater); 
(2)  AMC Title 15 (Fire Code); 
(3)  AMC Title 16 (Building and Construction); 
(4)  AMC Title 20 (Land Use); and 
(5)  Shoreline Management Master Program. 
(b)  This chapter establishes a process to implement and potentially lift development moratoria imposed by RCW 76.09.060 and WAC 222-20-050(3) subsequent to the harvesting of timber where a permit, approval, or a conversion option harvest plan agreement was not obtained pursuant to this chapter. 
(c)  This chapter establishes procedures, criteria, and standards governing the timing and coordination of timber harvesting and development, and the imposition and lifting, or exemption from development moratoria required by RCW 76.09.060 and WAC 222-20-050(3). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.80.030 - Definitions. 
Except as provided for in this section, this chapter will use existing definitions that are already in common use regarding the subject of forest practices. This shall include all the definitions contained in the Washington State Forest Practices Act (RCW 76.09.020), rules for the Washington State Forest Practices Act (WAC 222-16), and the AMC except as herein amended. 
"Act." The Forest Practices Act, Chapter 76.09 RCW. 
"Bankfull depth." The elevation of the water surface of a stream flow having a return period of approximately one and one-half years measured from the line of maximum depth of the stream or thalweg. (See Forest Practices Board Manual section 2 for measuring guidelines.) 
"Bankfull width" means the horizontal projection of bankfull depth to the stream bank. (See Forest Practices Board Manual section 2 for measuring guidelines.) 
"Board" means the Forest Practices Board established by RCW 76.09. 
"Channel migration zone (CMZ)" means the area where the active channel of a stream is prone to move and this results in a potential near-term loss of riparian habitat adjacent to the stream. (See Forest Practices Board Manual section 2 for descriptions and illustrations of CMZs and delineation guidelines except as modified by a permanent levee or dike.) 
"Classes of forest practices" means the four classifications of forest practices activities described in WAC 222-16-050. The class of forest practices is determined by considering several factors including but not limited to the type of activity proposed (e.g., harvesting, thinning, etc.), its scale, location of the property, the affected environment, and future use of the site. The description of the classes of forest practices paraphrased below are intended to summarize the classifications and do not supersede the specific definitions described in WAC 222-16 and RCW 76.09 and this chapter. 
(1)  Class I are those minor forest practices that have no direct potential for damaging a public resource that: 
(A)  Occur entirely outside of land designed as an urban growth area; 
(B)  On land not platted after January 1, 1960; and 
(C)  On land not intended for immediate conversion to another use. 
Examples of class I forest practices include timber harvests on parcels where contiguous ownership is less than two acres in size that are not within a shoreline designation or UGA, and none of the operation takes place within the riparian management zone of a type 2 or 3 water, or within the ordinary high water mark of a type 4 water or flowing type 5 water; the culture and harvest of Christmas trees and seedlings; tree planting and seeding; and cutting and/or removal of less than five thousand board feet of timber for personal use (e.g., firewood, fence post, etc.) in any consecutive twelve-month period. Class I forest practices do not require approval or a permit by DNR. 
(2)  Class II are those forest practices which have less than an ordinary potential for damaging a public resource that: 
(A)  Occur entirely outside of land designed as an urban growth area; 
(B)  On land not platted after January 1, 1960; and 
(C)  On land not intended for immediate conversion to another use. 
Examples of Class II forest practices include the construction of advance fire trails; timber harvests of less than forty acres; and the partial cutting of forty percent or less of the live timber volume on a site. Class II forest practices require notification to DNR prior to being conducted; they do not require an application. Property logged pursuant to a Class II permit must be reforested and is intended to remain in timber production. 
(3)  Class III are those forest practices not listed under Class I, II, and IV. Class III forest practices require permit approval by the DNR. Property logged pursuant to a Class III permit must be reforested and is intended to remain in timber production. 
(4)  Class IV forest practices are divided into two categories as follows: 
(A)  Class IV-General are those forest practices occurring: 
(i)  On lands within UGAs and platted after January 1, 1960; 
(ii)  On lands which are being converted to a use other than commercial timber production; or 
(iii)  On all lots, tracts, or parcels, where a previous land development activity has been authorized and where a critical area site plan has been recorded against the title of the real property. 
Examples of Class IV-general forest practices include harvest of timber and conversion of land to residential or commercial uses. Reforestation is not required under a class IV-general forest practices permit as the property subject to the permit is being converted to a non-forestry use. All class IV-general forest practices are considered conversion forest practices. 
(B)  Class IV-special are those forest practices that have the potential to result in a substantial impact to the environment. Examples of class IV-special forest practices include forest practices conducted on lands designated as critical wildlife habitat (state) or critical habitat (federal) for threatened or endangered wildlife species; forest practices or site preparation within one-half mile of a known active bald eagle nest site, documented by the Department of Fish and Wildlife or the department, between the dates of January 1 and August 15 or one-quarter mile at other times of the year, and within one-quarter mile of a communal roosting site; timber harvest in national, state, or local parks; groundwater recharge areas for glacial deep-seated landslides; and forest practices involving the filling or draining of more than one-half acre of wetland. 
Class IV-special forest practices include two subcategories: 
(i)  Class IV-special conversion forest practices include those practices, which result in the conversion of timber land to a non-forestry use, such as residential, commercial or industrial; or 
(ii)  Class IV-special non-conversion forest practices include those practices that will result in uses of the property consistent with timber growing. 
Clear-cut means a harvest method in which the entire stand of trees is removed in one timber harvesting operation. Except as provided in WAC 222-30-110, an area remains clear cut until: 
(1)  It meets the minimum stocking requirements under WAC 222-34-010(2) or 222-34-020(2); and 
(2)  The largest trees qualifying for the minimum stocking levels have survived on the area for five growing seasons or, if not, they have reached an average height of four feet. 
"Conversion, forest lands or forest lands conversion" means any Class IV general forest practices as defined by RCW 76.09.050. Also included are class I forest practices involving timber harvesting or road construction, and which are not directly associated with and supportive of commercial forest product production. In general terms, forest lands conversion refers to the cutting and removal of trees for the purpose of converting forest land to non-forestry use. 
"Conversion option harvest plan (COHP)" means a voluntary plan approved by the city indicating the limits (and types) of harvest areas, road locations, and open space. This approved plan, when submitted to the Washington State Department of Natural Resources as part of the forest practice application and followed by the forest land owner, gives a forest land owner the ability to harvest some timber on a site, while maintaining the option to convert lands to a non-forest production use in the future. A six-year moratorium shall not be imposed on a site that meets the conditions of an approved COHP. 
"Conversion to a use other than commercial timber operation" shall mean a bona fide conversion to an active use that is incompatible with timber growing. 
"Critical habitat (federal)" means the habitat of any threatened or endangered species designated as critical habitat by the United States Secretary of the Interior or commerce under sections 3 (5)(A) and 4 (a)(3) of the Federal Endangered Species Act. 
"Critical wildlife habitat (state)" means those habitats designated by the board in accordance with WAC 222-16-080. 
"Date of application approval." For those forest practices applications approved prior to July 27, 1997, date of application approval means the effective date listed on the Department of Natural Resources forest practices application. For those forest practices applications approved on or after July 27, 1997, date of application approval means the approval date as noted on the notice of moratorium recorded with Snohomish County. 
"Date of discovery" is the date when a city of Arlington site visit in conjunction with a pre-application conference, an application, development activity, complaint or an enforcement action first discovers timber harvesting has occurred to an extent that would require a conversion permit, as specified in this chapter. The city of Arlington shall provide written notice of the date of discovery to the applicant during the review process for the underlying permit. Written notice shall not occur during pre-application conferencing. 
"Deep-seated landslides" means landslides in which most of the area of the slide plane or zone lies below the maximum rooting depth of forest trees, to depths of tens to hundreds of feet. (See Forest Practices Board Manual section 16 for identification criteria.) 
"Department" means the city of Arlington Development Services (COADS) department. 
"Department of ecology" means the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE). 
"Department of Fish and Wildlife" means the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW). 
"Department of Natural Resources" means the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR). 
"Development moratorium" means the denial by the city of Arlington of any and all applications for permits or approvals for a period of time established in chapter 76.09 RCW. This shall include but not be limited to building permits, septic system permits, right-of-way permits, subdivision approvals, or change of zoning relating to the subject property. 
"Even-aged harvest methods" means the following harvest methods: 
(1)  Clear cuts;

(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.040 - Imposition of impact fees on development activity. 
(a)  All development projects within the city shall be assessed a transportation impact fee, at the rate of three thousand three hundred and fifty-five dollars, based on peak p.m. trips, as computed in accordance with the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, as applied to the city's transportation element of the adopted comprehensive plan. It is hereby declared that such impact fees shall: 
(1)  Only be imposed for system improvements that are reasonably related to new development; and, 
(2)  Not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, reasonably related to new development; and, 
(3)  Be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit new development; and 
(4)  Not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in any previously constructed system improvements. Such impact fee schedule is based upon the formula for calculating the proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, necessitated by new development to be borne by impact fees, which formulas are described in the transportation element of the city's comprehensive plan and incorporated herein by this reference. 
(b)  For subdivisions, short plats, and all other development activities, impact fees shall be assessed prior to the issuance of the building permit. Impact fees shall be due and payable, in whole at said time without interest. 
(c)  Failure to pay the impact fees for a given development activity at the time of assessment shall result in denial of the building permit for which the owner has applied. 
(d)  If, as a condition of approval of development activity, the city requires the dedication of land, or construction of system improvements, in excess of the minimum development standards set out in this title, the developer shall be eligible for a credit towards the transportation mitigation fees otherwise payable under this chapter. The amount of said credit shall be measured based on the pre-development fair market value of said land or improvements required in excess of the minimum standards and shall be deducted from the transportation mitigation fees charged under this chapter. 
(e)  A trip-for-trip credit for existing trips may be given when a site is being expanded or undergoing a change in use. However, no credits for existing trips may be transferred from one site to another. 
(f)  The city administrator or designee may adjust the amount of the impact fee otherwise imposed hereby with respect to specific projects requiring a building permit upon determining that: 
(1)  Unusual circumstances requires such adjustment to ensure that such impact fees are imposed fairly; and 
(2)  Studies and data submitted by the owner regarding the impacts of such owner's proposed development activity requires such adjustment to ensure that such impact fees are imposed fairly. Impact fees shall not be deemed unfair unless such unusual circumstances and studies and data support a finding that the impact fees otherwise imposed hereby allocate to the specific project in question a share of the cost of the systems improvements reasonably related to new development that is greater than or substantially less than such project's allocable proportionate share of such costs.

(c)  Cost Calculation by Element. The fees shall be calculated on a "per dwelling unit" basis, by "dwelling unit type" as set forth below: 
(1)  Site Acquisition Cost Element. 
{[B(2) x B(3)] ÷B(1)} x A(1) = Site Acquisition Cost Element 
Where: 
B(2) = Site Size (in acres, to the current 1/10th) 
B(3) = Land Cost (per acre, to the nearest dollar) 
B(1) = Facility Design Capacity (see 2. below) 
A(1) = Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type [see 2. below]) 
The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle or junior high and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added with the result being the "Total Site Acquisition Cost Element" for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below. 
(2)  School Construction Cost Element. 
[C(1) ÷ B(1)] x A(1) = School Construction Element. 
adv=6q;Where: 
C(1) = Estimated Facility Construction Cost 
B(1) = Facility Design Capacity 
A(1) = Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type) 
The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle or junior high and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added and multiplied by the square footage of permanent facilities divided by the total square footage of school facilities, with the result being the "Total School Construction Cost Element" for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below. 
(3)  Relocatable Facilities (Portables) Costs Element. 
[E(1) ÷ E(2)] x A(1) = Relocatable Facilities Cost Element 
Where: 
E(1) = Relocatable Facilities Cost 
E(2) = Relocatable Facilities Student Capacity 
A(1) = Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type) 
The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle or junior high, and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added and multiplied by the square footage of relocatable facilities divided by the total square footage of school facilities, with the result being the "Total Relocatable Facilities Cost Element" for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below. 
(d)  Credits Against Cost Calculation—Mandatory. 
(1)  State Match Credit. 
D(1) x D(3) x D(2) x A(1) = State Match Credit 
Where: 
D(1) = Boeckh Index 
D(3) = Square footage of school space allowed per student, by grade span, by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction 
D(2) = State Match Percentage 
A(1) = Student Factor (for each dwelling unit type) 
The above calculation shall be made for each of the identified grade levels (e.g., elementary, middle or junior high, and/or senior high). The totals shall then be added with the result being the "Total State Match Credit" for purposes of the final school impact fee calculation below. 
(2)  Tax Payment Credit. 
([(1 +F(1)) 10 ] - 1) / (F(1)(1+F(1)) 10 ) x F(2)] x F(3) = Tax Credit 
Where: 
F(1) = Interest Rate 
F(2) = District Property Tax Levy Rate 
F(3) = Average Assessed Value (for each dwelling unit type) 
(e)  Adjustments Against Cost Calculation. The district may provide an additional credit against school impact fees that the district determines will provide the best balance in system improvement funding between school impact fees and other sources of local public funds available to the district. This adjustment may reduce, but may not increase, the school impact fee from the amount determined by application of the elements identified above. The adjustment if any, applied by the district shall be specified within the capital facilities plan adopted by the city. 
(f)  Calculation of Total Impact Fee. 
(1)  The total school impact fee, per dwelling unit, assessed on a development activity shall be the sum of: 
Total Site Acquisition Cost Element 
Total School Construction Cost Element 
Total Relocatable Facilities Cost Element 
minus the sum of: 
Total State Match Credit 
Total Tax Payment Credit 
Elective Adjustment by the District 
expressed in Total Dollars per Dwelling Unit, by Dwelling Unit Type. 
(2)  The total school impact fee obligation for each development activity pursuant to the school impact fee schedule of this chapter shall be calculated as follows: 
Number of Dwelling Units, by Dwelling Unit Type, 
multiplied by 
School Impact Fee for Each Dwelling Unit Type, 
less 
the value of any in-kind contributions proposed by the developer and accepted by the school district. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.250 - Impact fee schedule—Exemptions.

(b)  The city council may, on a case-by-case basis, grant exemptions to the application of the fee schedule for affordable and for low-income housing activities in accordance with RCW 82.02.060(2). To qualify for such exemption, the developer of such housing shall submit a petition to the director for consideration by the council prior to application for building permit. The council shall establish conditions for such approvals at the time of approval that, at a minimum, meet the requirements of RCW 82.02.060(2) and which shall also include a requirement for a covenant to assure the project's continued use for low-income housing. The covenant entered into by and between the developer and the district shall be an obligation that runs with the land, and shall be recorded against the title of the real property upon which such housing is located in the real property records of Snohomish County. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003). 
(Ord. No. 1469, § 18, 4-20-2009)

20.90.270 - Impact fee limitations. 
(a)  School impact fees shall be imposed for district capital facilities that are reasonably related to the development under consideration, shall not exceed a proportionate share of the costs of system improvements that are reasonably related to the development, and shall be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development. 
(b)  School impact fees must be expended or encumbered for a permissible use within six years of receipt by the district. 
(c)  To the extent permitted by law, school impact fees may be collected for capital facilities costs previously incurred to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed capital facilities, provided that school impact fees shall not be imposed to make up for any existing system deficiencies. 
(d)  A developer required to pay a fee pursuant to RCW 43.21C.060 for capital facilities shall not be required to pay a school impact fee pursuant to RCW 82.02.050 - 100 and this Part for the same capital facilities. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.280 - Fee determination. 
(a)  For development that requires a land use permit, the city shall determine whether school impact fees are due at the time of issuance of said permit. The amount of the fee due shall be based on the fee schedule then in effect. 
(b)  For projects that do not require a land use permit (only a building permit), such a determination shall be made prior to issuance of building permits. For such projects, the amount of the fee due shall be based on the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid. 
(c)  The final determination of a development activity's fee obligation under this section shall be made prior to the application for building permit. Said final determination shall include any credits for in-kind contributions provided under Section 20.90.290 (Credit for In-Kind Contributions/Existing Lots), below. Final determinations may be appealed pursuant to the procedures established in Section 20.90.350 (Appeals of Decisions).

(a)  A developer may request, and the district may grant, a credit against school impact fees otherwise due under this Part for the value of any dedication of land, improvement to, or new construction of any capital facilities identified in the district's capital facilities plan provided by the developer. Such requests must be accompanied by supporting documentation of the estimated value of such in-kind contributions. All requests must be submitted to the district in writing, and a letter from the district granting such credit submitted to the department pursuant to Subsection (b) prior to its determination of the impact fee obligation for the development activity. 
(b)  Where the district determines that a development activity is eligible for a credit for a proposed in-kind contribution, it shall provide the department and the developer with a letter setting forth its agreement to the credit, the justification for the dollar amount of the credit, the legal description of any dedicated property, and a description of the development activity to which the credit may be applied. The value of any such credit may not exceed the impact fee obligation of the development activity in question. 
(c)  Where there is written agreement between the developer and the district concerning the value of proposed in-kind contributions, eligibility for a credit, and the amount of any credit, the director shall: a) adjust the impact fee obligation accordingly, and b) require that such contributions be made as a condition of development approval. Where there is disagreement between the developer and the district regarding the value of in-kind contributions, however, the district shall render a decision that can be appealed by the developer to the city's hearing examiner using the city's appeal process. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.300 - Sepa mitigation and other review. 
(a)  The city shall review development proposals and development activity permits pursuant to all applicable state and city laws and regulations, including the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW), the State Subdivision Act (Chapter 58.17 RCW) and the applicable sections of the Arlington Municipal Code (AMC). Following such review, the city may condition or deny development approval as necessary or appropriate to mitigate or avoid significant adverse impacts to school services and facilities, to assure that appropriate provisions are made for schools, school grounds, and safe student walking conditions, and to ensure that development is compatible and consistent with the district's services, facilities, and capital facilities plan. 
(b)  Impact fees required by this Part for development activity, together with compliance with development regulations and other mitigation measures offered or imposed at the time of development review and development activity review, shall constitute adequate mitigation for all of a development's specific adverse environmental impacts on the school system for the purposes of this Part. Nothing in this Part prevents a determination of significance from being issued, the application of new or different development regulations and/or requirements for additional environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures to the extent required by applicable law. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.310 - Collection of fees. 
(a)  Where school impact fees are found to be due for development that requires a land use permit, issuance of a building permit or for projects that do not require a land use permit (only a building permit), impact fees shall be paid to the district prior to issuance of building permits. The amount of the fee due shall be based on the fee schedule in effect at the time the impact fee payment is paid. 
(b)  Fee payments shall be made by the developer directly to the district, who shall then provide a receipt, a copy of which shall be provided by the developer to the department prior to the recordation of plats or issuance of permits. 
(c)  To receive school impact fees the district shall establish an interest-bearing account separate from all other district accounts. 
(d)  The district shall institute a procedure for the disposition of impact fees and provide for an annual report to the city that demonstrates compliance with the requirements of RCW 82.02.070, and other applicable laws.

20.90.320 - Use of funds. 
(a)  School impact fees may be used by the district only for capital facilities that are reasonably related to the development for which they were assessed and may be expended only in conformance with the district's adopted capital facilities plan. 
(b)  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advance provision of capital facilities for which school impact fees may be expended, and where consistent with the provisions of the bond covenants and state law, school impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the capital facilities provided are consistent with the requirements of this section. 
(c)  The responsibility for assuring that school impact fees are used for authorized purposes rests with the district. All interest earned on a school impact fee account must be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which the school impact fees were imposed, subject to the provisions of Section 20.90.330 (Refunds), below. 
(d)  The district shall provide the city an annual report showing the source and the amount of school impact fees received by the district and the capital facilities financed in whole or in part with those school impact fees. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.330 - Refunds. 
(a)  School impact fees not spent or encumbered within six years after they were collected shall, upon receipt of a proper and accurate claim, be refunded, together with interest, to the then current owner of the property by the district. In determining whether school impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. At least annually, the district, based on the annual report pursuant to Section 20.90.310 (Collection of Fees) shall give notice to the last known address of potential claimants of any funds, if any, that it has collected fees that have not been spent or encumbered. The notice will state that any persons entitled to such refunds may make claims. 
(b)  Refunds provided for under this section shall be paid only upon submission of a proper claim pursuant to district claim procedures. Such claims must be submitted to the district within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises, or the date of notification provided for above, where applicable, whichever is later. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.340 - Administrative adjustment of fee amount. 
(a)  Within fourteen days of acceptance by the city of a building permit application, a developer or school district may appeal to the city's hearing examiner for an adjustment to the fees imposed by this title. The hearing examiner may adjust the amount of the fee, in consideration of studies and data submitted by the developer and the school district, if one or the following circumstances exists, provided that the discount set forth in the fee formula fails to adjust for the error in the calculation or fails to ameliorate for the unfairness of the fee: 
(1)  It can be demonstrated that the school impact fee for assessment was incorrectly calculated; 
(2)  Unusual circumstances of the development activity demonstrate that application of the school impact fee to the development would be unfair or unjust; 
(3)  A credit for in-kind contributions by the developer, as provided for under Section 20.90.290 (Credit for In-Kind Contributions/Existing Lots) is warranted; or 
(4)  Any other credit specified in RCW 82.02.060(1)(b) may be warranted. 
(b)  To avoid delay pending resolution of the appeal, school impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a development approval. 
(c)  Failure to exhaust this administrative remedy shall preclude appeals of the school impact fee pursuant to Section 20.90.350 (Appeals of Decisions). 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.90.350 - Appeals of decisions. 
(a)  Any person aggrieved by a decision applying an impact fee under this Part to a development activity may appeal such decision pursuant to provisions of Chapter 20.20 (Appeals, Variances, Interpretations). Where there is an administrative appeal process for the underlying development approval, appeals of an impact fee under this Part must be combined with the administrative appeal for the underlying development approval. Where there is no administrative appeal for the permit, then appeals solely of the impact fee issue shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 20.20. 
(b)  The impact fee may be modified upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on the application of the criteria contained in Section 20.90.340 (Administrative Adjustment of Fee Amount). Appeals shall be limited to application of the impact fee provisions to the specific development activity and the provisions of this Part shall be presumed valid.

(1)  Issuance of the certificate of occupancy for completion of the single-family residence; 
(2)  At the time of closing of the first sale of any portion of the property covered by the building permit; or 
(3)  Eighteen months from the date of issuance of the building permit. 
The city may withhold certification of final inspection, certification of occupancy, or any equivalent certification, and the extension of utilities until the impact fees are paid in full. 
(b)  The amount of impact fees that may be deferred under this section will be determined by the fees in effect at the time the applicant applies for the deferral. 
(c)  Each applicant for a single-family residential construction permit, in accordance with his or her contractor registration number, social security number, or other unique identification number, is entitled to annually receive deferrals under this section for only the first twenty single-family residential construction building permits. A separate application and fee payment shall be required for each single-family residence being constructed. For purposes of this section, the term "applicant" as defined in Section 20.08.010 shall also include any entity which controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant. 
(d)  Unless a written agreement between the buyer and the seller is received at the time of closing, the payment of impact fees due at closing of the sale must be made from the seller's proceeds. In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the seller bears strict liability for the payment of all impact fees. 
(e)  An applicant seeking a deferral under this section must grant and record a deferred impact fee lien against the property in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee prior to issuance of a building permit. The deferred impact fee lien, which must include the legal description, tax account number, and address of the property, must also be: 
(1)  In a form approved by the city; 
(2)  Signed by all owners of the property and persons or entities holding any interest in the property, with all signatures acknowledged as required for a deed, and recorded in the county;

(f)  If the impact fees are not paid in accordance with a deferral authorized by this section, and in accordance with the term provisions in subsection (a), the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with RCW Chapter 61.12. If the impact fee is a school impact fee collected under Section 20.90.230, then the city may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with RCW Chapter 61.12 upon request by the school district for which the fee is collected, and if the city does not do so within forty-five days, the school district may institute foreclosure proceedings in accordance with RCW Chapter 61.12. In the event of foreclosure by either the city or the affected school district, interest shall accrue from the date of the recording of the lien at the statutory rate of interest. 
(g)  Upon receipt of final payment of all deferred impact fees for a property, the city will execute a release of the deferred impact fee lien for the property. The property owner at the time of the release, at the property owner's sole expense, shall be responsible for recording the lien release. 
(h)  The extinguishment of a deferred impact fee lien by the foreclosure of a lien having priority does not affect the obligation to pay the impact fees as a condition of final inspection, certificate of occupancy, or at the time of closing of the first sale.

Chapter 20.93 - ENVIRONMENTALLY CRITICAL AREAS[7] 
Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-013, § 2, adopted July 18, 2016, amended the title of ch. 20.93 to read as set out herein. Previously ch. 20.93 was titled "Environmentally Critical Areas." 
 
Part I. - Purpose and Intent 
 
20.93.010 - Purpose and intent. 
This chapter establishes regulations for the protection of environmentally critical areas (ECAs) including critical areas, natural resource lands, and protective buffers. While it is intended that this chapter fulfill the mandates of the Washington State Growth Management Act, that is not its sole purpose: Its primary purpose is to fulfill the legislative intent of the city, which is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city by providing for the long-term preservation of natural systems and their functions. This is to be accomplished by establishing prohibitions, mitigation requirements, and minimum standards for the use and development of properties that contain or adjoin environmentally critical areas. Additionally, this chapter is intended to: 
(1)  If at all possible, avoid impacts to environmentally critical areas. If this is not practicable, then: 
(A)  Minimize or limit the degree or magnitude of actions and their implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts. 
(B)  Mitigate any impacts by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment. 
(C)  Reduce or eliminate any impacts over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. 
(D)  Compensate for unavoidable impacts by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments through monitoring of specific and cumulative impacts. 
(2)  Protect the public from personal injury, loss of life, or property damage due to flooding, erosion, landslides, seismic events, or soil subsidence. 
(3)  Protect against publicly financed expenditures due to the misuse of environmentally critical areas that cause: 
(A)  Unnecessary maintenance and replacement of public facilities; 
(B)  Publicly funded mitigation of avoidable impacts; 
(C)  Cost for public emergency rescue and relief operations where the causes are avoidable; 
(D)  Degradation of the natural environment. 
(4)  Protect aquatic resources. 
(5)  Protect unique, fragile, and valuable elements of the environment, including wildlife and its habitat. 
(6)  Alert appraisers, assessors, owners, potential buyers, or lessees to the development limitations of environmentally critical areas. 
(7)  Provide city officials with sufficient information to adequately protect environmentally critical areas when approving, conditioning, or denying applications for public or private development proposals. 
(8)  Give guidance to the development of comprehensive plan policies in regard to the natural systems and environment of the city watershed(s). 
(9)  Provide property owners and developers with succinct information regarding the city's requirements for property development, thus rationalizing and accelerating the development permit application process.

(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.270 - Site/resource specific reports. 
Unless waived per Section 20.93.260 (General Provisions—Submittal Requirements), all applications for land use or development permits proposed on properties containing or adjacent to environmentally critical areas or their defined buffers (see section specific requirements) shall include site/resource specific reports prepared to describe the environmental limitations of the site. These reports shall conform in format and content to guidelines prepared by the department of community development, which is hereby authorized to do so. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.280 - Maps and inventory. 
The approximate location and extent of environmentally critical areas in the city are displayed on various inventory maps available at the department of community development. More data will be included as inventories are completed in compliance with the requirements of the growth management act. Maps and inventory lists are guides to the general location and extent of environmentally critical areas. Environmentally critical areas not shown are presumed to exist in the city and are protected under all the provisions of this chapter. The shoreline jurisdiction areas are identified in the adopted shoreline maps (AMC 20.93.970). In the event that any of the designations shown on the maps or inventory lists conflict with the criteria set forth in this chapter, the criteria and site specific conditions shall control. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.290 - Dedication of environmentally critical area easements. 
(a)  In order to protect environmentally critical areas, environmentally critical area easements or tracts, where proposed as mitigation, shall be marked as such and dedicated to the city and recorded with Snohomish County. Appropriate demarcation methods shall be as set forth in the public works construction standards and specifications, and include appropriate permanent fencing and signage unless otherwise determined by the natural resources manager. Fencing or demarcation method must be built of materials that are permanent in nature. Fencing may not be required if the site is a know migration route for wildlife and due to other constraints such as roadways or buildings a fence would prevent migration of those species. Alternative methods of demarcation will be required to replace signage when determined that effectiveness of signage may be limited. 
(b)  Anyone may offer to dedicate an environmentally critical area easement or tract and its buffer to the city even if not proposed as mitigation. 
(c)  Such easements or tracts shall cover the environmentally critical area as delineated by their defined boundaries and their buffers. 
(d)  The basic controlling language for such easements shall be as follows, though site/resource specific modifications may be made: 
"Critical Area Protection Easement: This open space tract is intended to protect insert ECA type and native vegetation and shall preclude: grading or any recontouring of the land; placement of structures, wells, leach fields, utility lines and/or easements, and any other thing; vehicle activity; grazing; dumping; and the addition or removal of vegetation, except pursuant to an approved restoration plan, and except that vegetation may be selectively removed and/or pervious trails and/or utility lines compatible with native tree and shrub vegetation may be placed in the buffer areas in locations approved by the Director of Planning and Community Development." 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.300 - Dedication of land and/or easements in lieu of required parks or open space. 
The dedication of environmentally critical areas and their buffers may not be used for satisfying the park or open space requirements of AMC Chapter 20.52 (Recreational Facilities and Open Space). 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.310 - Increased buffer widths. 
The permit-issuing authority shall require increased standard buffer zone widths on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect environmentally critical area functions and values based on local conditions. This determination shall be supported by appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the regulated environmentally critical area. Such determination shall be attached as a permit condition and shall demonstrate that: 
(1)  A larger buffer is necessary to maintain viable populations of existing species; or 
(2)  The environmentally critical area is used by species proposed or listed by the federal government or the state as endangered, threatened, sensitive, candidate, or monitor, critical or outstanding potential habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries or raptor nesting trees; or 
(3)  The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than fifteen percent and is therefore susceptible to severe erosion, and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse environmentally critical area impacts. 
(4)  The recommended widths for buffers are based on the assumption that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion or with one that performs similar functions. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided. Generally, improving the vegetation will be more effective than widening the buffer. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.320 - Buffer width averaging. 
Buffer widths may be modified by averaging. In no instance shall the buffer width be reduced by more than twenty-five percent of the standard buffer unless specifically identified in other sections of this chapter. Buffer width averaging shall be allowed only where the applicant demonstrates all of the following: 
(1)  That averaging is necessary to avoid an extraordinary hardship to the applicant caused by circumstances peculiar to the property or that there would be a benefit to the environmentally critical area; 
(2)  That the least impactive aspects of the proposed land use would be located adjacent to areas where the buffer width is reduced; 
(3)  That width averaging will not adversely impact the environmentally critical area functional values; and 
(4)  That the total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less than that contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.330 - Buffers to be retained in natural condition. 
Except as otherwise specified, all buffers shall be retained in their natural condition. Where buffer disturbance may or has occurred during construction, revegetation with native vegetation will be required. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.340 - Building setbacks from buffers. 
A building setback of fifteen feet is required from the edge of any critical area buffer, as defined in subsequent sections of this chapter. Minor structural intrusions into the area of the building setback may be allowed if the permit-issuing authority determines that such intrusions will not negatively impact the environmentally critical area or cause the buffer vegetation to be trimmed or removed. The setback shall be identified on the site plan. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.360 - Reserved.  
20.93.370 - Non-conforming activities. 
Except for cases of discontinuance as part of normal agricultural practices, non-conforming uses shall be governed by Part VI of this chapter and AMC Chapter 20.32 (Nonconforming Situations). 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.380 - Assessment relief. 
The Snohomish County Assessor's office considers environmentally critical area regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped critical area who has dedicated an easement or entered into a perpetual conservation restriction with the city of Arlington or a qualified nonprofit organization to permanently control some or all regulated activities in that portion of land assessed consistent with these restrictions shall be considered for exemption from special assessments to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and water mains. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.390 - Mitigation plan requirements. 
In the event that mitigation is required, the applicant shall be required to provide a mitigation plan for approval by the community development director. The plan shall provide information on land acquisition, construction, maintenance and monitoring of the replaced critical area. All mitigation plans shall include the following submitted by the applicant or a qualified biologist, civil or geotechnical engineer: 
(1)  Specific goals and objectives describing site function, target species and selection criteria; 
(2)  Performance standards that shall include criteria for assessing goals and objectives; 
(3)  Contingency plans that clearly define course of action or corrective measures needed if performance standards are not met; 
(4)  A legal description and a survey prepared by a licensed surveyor of the proposed development site and location of the critical area(s) on the site; 
(5)  The need for performance or maintenance securities. 
(6)  A scaled plot plan that indicates the proposed construction in relation to zoning setback requirements and sequence of construction location in relation to zoning setback requirements and sequence of construction phases including cross-sectional details, topographic survey data (including percent slope, existing and finished grade elevations) and other technical information as required in sufficient detail to explain, illustrate and provide for: 
(A)  Soil and substrate conditions, topographic elevations, scope of grading and excavation proposal, erosion and sediment treatment and source controls needed for critical area construction and maintenance; 
(B)  Planting plans specifying plant species, types, quantities, location, size spacing, or density. The planting season or timing, watering schedule, and nutrient requirements for planting, and where appropriate, measures to protect plants from destruction; and 
(C)  Contingency or mid-course corrections plan and a minimum five-year monitoring and replacement plan establishing responsibility for removal of exotic and nuisance vegetation and permanent establishment of the critical area and all component parts. 
(7)  A clearly defined approach to assess progress of the project. 
(8)  The plan must indicate ownership, size, type, and complete ecological assessment including flora, fauna, hydrology, functions, etc., of the critical area being restored or created; and 
(9)  The plan must also provide information on the natural suitability of the proposed site for establishing the replaced critical area, including water source and drainage patterns, topographic position, wildlife habitat opportunities, value of existing area to be converted, etc. 
(10)  Once the plan is implemented, as-builts shall also be submitted pursuant to department of public works requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)

(6)  Habitats or species of local importance. Such habitats or species may be locally listed per the process elucidated in Section 20.93.420 (Species/habitats of local importance). 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.410 - Determination of boundary. 
The community development director shall determine the boundaries of fish and wildlife conservation areas. In doing so he may rely on information from qualified federal, state, county, or tribal agencies or on a biological resources survey prepared by a qualified wildlife biologist per the department's biological resources survey guidelines. Such reports or information may be required to be provided by an applicant for an activity or permit at the request of the city. In the location of shoreline jurisdiction the adopted Shoreline designation maps establish the boundary. When a project is at or below OHWM and within shoreline setbacks, the OHWM shall be determined by a site-specific investigation using field indicators. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.420 - Species/habitats of local importance. 
(a)  Species or habitats may be listed as a species or habitat of local importance by the city council according to the following process: 
(1)  An individual or organization must: 
(A)  Demonstrate a need for special consideration based on:

(3)  The city council will hold a public hearing for proposals found to be complete, accurate, potentially effective, and within the scope of this chapter. Approved nominations will become designated a "species or habitat of local importance" and will be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Species or habitats of local importance include: 
(1)  None adopted as of December 5, 2011. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.430 - Allowed activities. 
Except where regulated by other sections of this or any other title or law, the following uses shall be allowed within fish and wildlife conservation areas when the requirements of Section 20.93.440 (Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas—Requirements) have been met and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed: 
(1)  Those activities listed in Section 20.93.220 (General Provisions—Allowed activities). 
(2)  Activities consistent with the species located there and all applicable state and federal regulations regarding the species, as determined by the community development director, who will consult with other resource agencies including tribes as to their recommendations based on adopted standards or guidance. 
(3)  Within the fifty-foot management zone of the buffer required pursuant to Section 20.93.440 (Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas—Requirements) the following uses are allowed as long as sixty-five percent of native tree cover is established and maintained and the total effective impervious area (TIA) remains below three percent: 
(A)  When the fifty-foot management zone is in an already developed state including buildings, parking lots, lawn or ornamental landscaping stormwater management systems designed to blend into the natural landscape allowing full mature growth of native trees and shrubs, and provide the same or greater functional habitat that would occur in a naturally vegetated buffer. Specifically, this does not include buried vaults, ecology block or grass-lined ponds or swales (though ponds or swales planted with native vegetation may be allowed). Such systems are required to provide diffuse effluent point(s) to the immediate edge of the no-touch buffer to allow infiltration and polishing. Walkways and trails, provided that those pathways are limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality. They should be generally parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer twenty-five percent of the wetland buffer area, and located to avoid removal of significant trees. They should be limited to pervious surfaces no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only. Raised boardwalks utilizing non-treated pilings may be acceptable. 
(B)  Utility easements and access routes that are built so as to not affect the lateral or vertical hydrology of the system, and are compatible with full maturity of native tree and shrub species. 
(C)  Other uses as may be approved by the city's natural resources manager as recommended in a local, state or federal watershed management plan or low impact development regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.440 - Requirements. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c): 
(1)  For endangered or threatened salmonid fish and wildlife conservation areas, a one hundred fifty-foot buffer shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to the fish and wildlife conservation areas. This buffer shall consist of a one hundred-foot area closest to the stream or river being designated a native growth protection easement in which no human activities may be allowed (except as provided by Section 20.93.430 (Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas—Allowed activities), and the remaining fifty-foot zone being designated a management zone, in which vegetation may be managed solely for public health and safety reasons that may threaten structures or public infrastructure. The natural resource may require a landowner to have an assessment performed by a professional arborist to determine if a tree is hazardous. If found hazardous the methods of removal will utilize options that will result in some level of habitat function (i.e. snag, nurse log, etc). Buffers for salmonid fish and wildlife conservation areas shall be measured pursuant to Section 20.93.730 (Streams, Creeks, Lakes, and Other Surface Water—Requirements). 
(2)  For all other fish and wildlife conservation areas, the applicant shall have a habitat protection plan prepared by a qualified biologist, in which appropriate buffers and other protection shall be identified based on the best available science and/or standards promulgated by the state or federal agency with jurisdiction for the identified species being protected. Buffers shall be measured from the fish and wildlife conservation areas boundary as surveyed in the field. 
(b)  Buffer widths may be increased based on recommendations by the state or federal agency with jurisdiction. 
(c)  Buffer widths from fish and wildlife conservation areas may be decreased in areas where specific project recommendations can be found in Section 20.93.320 of this chapter, local watershed recovery plans, the Shoreline Master Program has identified allowed uses, a habitat protection plan, or either a property-specific or programmatic biological assessment showing that the proposal would have negligible adverse impact on the protected species or habitat (with or without mitigation) has been approved by the state or federal agency with jurisdiction. Said biological assessments would be prepared by the applicant in a format approved by the agency with jurisdiction. The width of the buffer would be determined through this biological assessment approval process but could in no case be reduced to less than that required for the underlying environmentally critical areas by other sections of this chapter. 
(d)  For streams upstream from an endangered or threatened salmonid fish and wildlife conservation area, if requested by the city, applicants shall have prepared a report analyzing potential downstream impacts to the FWCA and propose appropriate measures to mitigate any identified significant impacts. Such reports shall be prepared by a qualified biologist. 
(e)  The applicant shall dedicate a functionally exclusive environmentally critical area easement for the protection of wildlife and/or habitat over the fish and wildlife conservation areas and its buffer, as determined above. Where such requirement leads to, or would in the opinion of the permit-issuing authority lead to, a court finding of a taking mitigation as described in Section 20.93.450 (Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas—Mitigation) may be considered. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.450 - Mitigation. 
In order to avoid significant environmental impacts and, if in the opinion of the permit-issuing authority the requirements listed in Section 20.93.440 (Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas—Requirements) do not adequately mitigate impacts, the applicant for a land use activity or development permit may consider performing the following actions, listed in order of preference. What is considered adequate mitigation will depend on the nature and magnitude of the potential impact. Specific mitigation requirements are outlined in the Shoreline Master Program regulations. 
(1)  Where on-site protection is not possible, dedicate a functionally exclusive easement for the protection of equivalent (in type and value) wildlife and/or habitat over fish and wildlife conservation areas and a one hundred fifty-foot buffer on off-site fish and wildlife conservation areas at a minimum two to one ratio (two offsite areas for every one onsite area impacted) on property that would likely not be required to dedicate such an easement were it to undergo a permitting process. If functionally equivalent habitat is not available, then a higher ratio may be considered to compensate. The location of any off-site fish and wildlife conservation areas shall be located as near to the site as possible, following this preferred order: 
(A)  Hydrologically connected to the impacted fish and wildlife conservation areas or via an intact habitat corridor, 
(B)  Elsewhere within the city, 
(C)  Within the Arlington UGA, 
(D)  Within the sub-basin, and 
(E)  Watershed.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-013, § 7, adopted July 18, 2016, repealed §§ 20.93.500—20.93.540, in their entirety. Former §§ 20.93.500—20.93.540 pertained to "Classification," "Determination of boundary," "Allowed activities," "Requirements," and "Mitigation," respectively, and were derived from Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, adopted December 5, 2011 and Ord. No. 2014-005, § 3, adopted June 16, 2014. 
 
20.93.500—20.93.540 - Reserved.  
Part VI. - Geologically Hazardous Areas 
 
20.93.600 - Classification. 
(a)  Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquakes, liquefaction, or other geological events. Geologically hazardous areas shall be classified based upon the history or existence of landslides, unstable soils, steep slopes, high erosion potential or seismic hazards. In determining the significance of a geologically hazardous area the following criteria shall be used: 
(1)  Potential economic, health, safety, and environmental impact related to construction in the area; 
(2)  Soil type, slope, vegetative cover, and climate of the area; 
(3)  Available documentation of history of soil movement, the presence of mass wastage, debris flow, rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion or undercutting by wave action, or the presence of an alluvial fan which may be subject to inundation, debris flows, or deposition of stream-transported sediments. 
(b)  The different types of geologically hazardous areas are defined as follows: 
(1)  Erosion hazard areas are as defined by the USDA Soil Conservation Service, United States Geologic Survey, or by the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas. The following classes are high erosion hazard areas. 
(A)  Class 3, class U (unstable) includes severe erosion hazards and rapid surface runoff areas; 
(B)  Class 4, class UOS (unstable old slides) includes areas having severe limitations due to slope; and, 
(C)  Class 5, class URS (unstable recent slides). 
(2)  Landslide hazard areas shall include areas subject to severe risk of landslide based on a combination of geologic, topographic and hydrologic factors. Some of these areas may be identified in the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas, or through site-specific criteria. Landslide hazard areas include any of the following: 
(A)  Areas characterized by slopes greater than fifteen percent and impermeable soils (typically silt and clay) frequently interbedded with permeable granular soils (predominantly sand and gravel) or impermeable soils overlain with permeable soils or springs or groundwater seepage; 
(B)  Any area that has exhibited movement during the Holocene epoch (from ten thousand years ago to present) or which is underlain by mass wastage debris of that epoch; 
(C)  Any area potentially unstable due to rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion or undercutting by wave action; 
(D)  Any area located on an alluvial fan presently subject to or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or deposition of steam-transported sediments; 
(E)  Any area with a slope of thirty-three percent or greater and with a vertical relief of ten or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock; 
(F)  Any area with slope defined by the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service as having a severe limitation for building site development; and 
(G)  Any shoreline designated or mapped as class U, UOS, or URS by the Department of Ecology Coastal Zone Atlas. 
(3)  Slopes. 
(A)  Moderate slopes shall include any slope greater than or equal to fifteen percent and less than thirty-three percent. 
(B)  Steep slopes shall include any slope greater than or equal to thirty-three percent. 
(4)  Seismic hazard areas shall include areas subject to severe risk of earthquake damage as a result of seismic induced settlement, shaking, slope failure or soil liquefaction. These conditions occur in areas underlain by cohesion less soils of low density usually in association with a shallow groundwater table. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.610 - Determination of boundary. 
The community development director, relying on a geotechnical or similar technical report and other information where available and pertinent, shall make determination of a boundary of a geologically hazardous area. Such reports or information shall be provided by an applicant for an activity or permit at the request of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.620 - Allowed activities. 
Except where regulated by other sections of this or any other title or law, the following uses shall be allowed within geologically hazardous areas when the requirements of Section 20.93.630 (Geologically hazardous areas—Requirements) have been met and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed: 
(1)  Those activities allowed per Section 20.93.220 (General provisions—Allowed activities). 
(2)  Any other use allowed per the zone, provided that it meets the requirements of Section 20.93.630 (Geologically hazardous areas—Requirements) and will not have a detrimental impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the public, or will not negatively impact neighboring properties. 
(3)  Recontouring of land to eliminate geologically hazardous areas, including steep slopes, is expressly prohibited unless otherwise approved through the land use permit process (not the construction plan review process). The permit issuing authority may approve recontouring to eliminate geological hazardous areas only upon finding that such action would serve the health, safety, and welfare of the general public and not just a particular development proposal. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011; Ord. No. 2016-013, § 8, 7-18-2016)  
20.93.630 - Requirements. 
(a)  Erosion Hazard Areas. All development proposals on sites containing erosion hazard areas shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Erosion Control Plan. The applicant shall submit an erosion control plan prior to the approval of any permit. Plans shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the International Building Code (IBC) grading section and the department of public works' construction standards and specifications. 
(2)  Alteration. All authorized clearing for roads, utilities, etc., shall be limited to the minimum necessary to accomplish the engineering design. Alterations of erosion hazard sites shall meet the requirements of Chapter 20.44, Part II (Land clearing, grading, filling, and excavation). 
(b)  Landslide hazard areas. All development proposals on sites containing landslide hazard areas shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Alterations. Landslide hazard areas located on slopes thirty-three percent or greater shall be altered only as allowed under standards for steep slopes set forth in this section. Landslide hazard areas and land adjacent to such a hazard area located on slopes less than thirty-three percent may be altered if: 
(A)  The proposal will not increase surface water discharge or sedimentation and will not decrease adjacent property slope stability; and 
(B)  It can be demonstrated through geotechnical analysis that there is no significant risk to the development proposal or adjacent properties or that the proposal can be designed so that the landslide hazard is significantly eliminated or mitigated such that the site and adjacent property are rendered as safe as an area without landslide hazards. 
(2)  Buffers. Unless the alteration is approved under the provisions in subsection (1) (Alterations), a minimum buffer of fifty feet shall be provided from the edges of all landslide hazard areas regardless of slope. The buffer may be extended beyond these limits to mitigate erosion hazards. 
(3)  Building setback lines. All buildings are required to be set back a minimum of fifteen feet from the buffer or landslide hazard area. 
(c)  Slopes. Grading, vegetation removal, and other site disturbances on slopes can lead to erosion or landslides. If the amount of the slope disturbed is decreased, then the risk of erosion and landslides decreases. The risk is also less on slopes that are less steep. Therefore, all site disturbances on moderate and steep slopes and their buffers shall be reviewed and certain standards are required to be met depending on the percent of slope. 
(1)  The maximum slope and buffer disturbance allowed, unless restricted for other reasons, is: 
Table 20.93-2: Slope Disturbance Allowed 
Slope 	Disturbance Allowed 
1—14% 	100% 
15—24% 	60% 
25—32% 	45% 
33% or greater 	0% 
 
(2)  Development on moderate and steep slopes shall meet the following standards: 
(A)  Development must be located to minimize disturbance and removal of vegetation and also to protect most critical areas and retain open space. 
(B)  Structures must be located or clustered where possible to reduce disturbance and maintain natural topographic character. 
(C)  Grading shall be minimized; 
(D)  Structures should conform to the natural contour of the slope, with foundations tiered where possible to conform to existing topography of site. 
(E)  Natural surface or sub-surface drainage courses shall be preserved. 
(F)  All development proposals shall be designed to minimize the footprint of building and other disturbed areas. Common access drives and utility corridors are encouraged. 
(G)  All development shall be designed to minimize impervious lot coverage and should incorporate under- or over-structure parking and multi-level structures. 
(H)  Roads, walkways and parking areas should be designed to parallel the natural contours. 
(I)  Access shall be in the least critical area of the site. 
(3)  Additional standards for steep slopes: All proposed development on steep slopes shall be avoided if possible. Alterations are allowed in only the following instances provided that the standards in subsections (1) and (2), can be met; and, where it has been demonstrated through a soils report prepared by a geotechnical engineer that no adverse impact will result from the proposal and where approved surface water conveyance will result in minimum slope and vegetation disturbance: 
(A)  The construction of approved public or private trails provided they are constructed in a manner that is not detrimental to surface water runoff control (e.g., cable lift access); and 
(B)  The construction of public or private utility corridors in accordance with Chapter 20.93 regulations provided it has been demonstrated that such alterations will not increase landslide or erosion risks. 
(4)  In all other cases, no disturbance is allowed on a steep slope and a minimum fifteens-foot vegetated buffer shall be established from the top, toe and along all sides of the slope. The buffer may be extended beyond these limits on a case-by-case basis to mitigate landslide and erosion hazards. 
(d)  Seismic Hazard Areas. Standards for development in seismic hazard areas shall be in accordance with the provisions in the IBC, as adopted by the city. 
(e)  For all geological hazardous areas on which development is not permitted by the above regulations, the applicant shall dedicate to the city an exclusive environmentally critical area easement for the protection of geological hazardous areas over the environmentally critical area and a buffer consistent with the standards listed above. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011; Ord. No. 2016-013, §§ 9, 10, 7-18-2016)  
20.93.640 - Mitigation. 
If potential geologic impacts cannot be avoided by adhering to the above requirements, other forms of mitigation may be considered. Applicants must provide mitigation plans exploring and analyzing any proposed mitigation measures. What is considered adequate mitigation will depend on the nature and magnitude of the potential impact. For example, some potential risk due to construction in geologically hazardous areas may be reduced through retention of existing vegetation. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011; Ord. No. 2016-013, § 11, 7-18-2016)  
Part VII. - Streams, Creeks, Rivers, Lakes and Other Surface Water 
 
20.93.700 - Classification. 
(a)  The city hereby adopts the stream classification system of the state, as specified in WAC 222-16-030, as may be amended. Briefly, these are as follows (see WAC 222-16-030 for complete definitions of types): 
(1)  Type S water means all the waters, within their ordinary high-water mark, as inventoried as "shorelines of the state" under Chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW, but not including those waters' associated wetlands as defined in Chapter 90.58 RCW. 
(2)  Type F-ESA water means all the waters meeting the criteria of Type F stream, but has been identified as having presumed use by ESA listed fish species. 
(b)  "Type F water" shall mean segments of natural waters that are not classified as Type 1 water and have a substantial fish, wildlife, or human use. These are segments of natural waters and periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands, which: 
(1)  Are diverted for domestic use by more than one hundred residential or camping units or by a public accommodation facility licensed by the state to serve more than one hundred persons, where such diversion is determined by the Washington State Department of Ecology to be a valid appropriation of water and the only practical water source for such users. Such waters shall be considered to be Type 2 water upstream from the point of such diversion for one thousand five hundred feet or until the drainage area is reduced by fifty percent, whichever is less; 
(2)  Are within a federal, state, local, or private campground having more than thirty camping units: Provided, that the water shall not be considered to enter a campground until it reaches the boundary of the park lands available for public use and comes within one hundred feet of a camping unit, trail or other park improvement; 
(3)  Are used by substantial numbers of anadromous or resident game fish for spawning, rearing or migration. Waters having the following characteristics are presumed to have highly significant fish populations: 
(A)  Stream segments having a defined channel twenty feet or greater in width between the ordinary high-water marks and having a gradient of less than four percent. 
(B)  Lakes, ponds, or impoundments having a surface area of one acre or greater at seasonal low water; or 
(4)  Are used by salmonids for off-channel habitat. These areas are critical to the maintenance of optimum survival of juvenile salmonids. This habitat shall be identified based on the following criteria: 
(A)  The site must be connected to a stream bearing salmonids and accessible during some period of the year; and 
(B)  The off-channel water must be accessible to juvenile salmonids through drainage with less than a five percent gradient. 
(C)  Ponds or impoundments having a surface area of less than one-half acre at seasonal low water and having an outlet to an anadromous fish stream. 
(5)  Are highly significant for protection of downstream water quality. Tributaries which contribute greater than twenty percent of the flow to a Type S or F water are presumed to be significant for one thousand five hundred feet from their confluence with the Type S or F water or until their drainage area is less than fifty percent of their drainage area at the point of confluence, whichever is less. 
(c)  Type Np water. Segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of defined channels that are perennial nonfish habitat streams. Perennial streams are waters that do not go dry any time of the year of normal rainfall. However, for the purpose of water typing, Type Np waters include the intermittent dry portions of the perennial channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow. Np waters begin downstream of the point along the channel where the contributing basin area is at least fifty-two acres in size. 
(d)  Type Ns water shall be segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of the defined channels that are not Type S, F, or Np waters. These are seasonal, nonfish habitat streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall and are not located downstream from any stream reach that is a Type Np water. Ns waters must be physically connected by an above-ground channel system to Type S, F, or Np waters. 
(e)  Non-natural water course means constructed vegetated swales and ditches that are designed and installed for the express purpose of periodically moving storm water not associated with naturally occurring streams. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.710 - Determination of boundary. 
The community development director, relying on delineation by a licensed engineer or other comparable expert, shall determine the boundary of the creek, stream, river, lake, or other surface water. For ravines with banks greater than ten feet in depth the boundary shall be contiguous with the top of the bank. Where there is no ravine or the bank is less than ten feet in depth, the boundary shall be contiguous with the ordinary high water mark. In case of disagreement as to its location, the ultimate decision on the OHWM shall rest with ecology. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.720 - Allowed activities. 
Except where regulated by other sections of this, Shoreline Master Program or any other title or law (e.g., see Part IV of this chapter, Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas), the following uses shall be allowed within streams, creeks, rivers, lakes, and other surface waters when the requirements of Section 20.93.730 (Streams, Creeks, Rivers, Lakes and Other Surface Water—Requirements) have been met and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed: 
(1)  Those activities allowed under Section 20.93.220 (General Provisions—Allowed activities). 
(2)  Bridges and other crossings for public and private rights-of-way where no other feasible means on ingress and egress to a parcel is available. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.730 - Requirements. 
(a)  To retain the natural functions of streams and stream corridors, and unless modified by Part IV (Fish and Wildlife Habitat), the streamside buffers listed in Table 20.93-3: Non-ESA Stream Buffer Width shall be maintained on both sides of the environmentally critical area. All existing native vegetation within these buffers shall be preserved. (Note also that buffer averaging may be allowed pursuant to Section 20.93.320 (General Provisions—Buffer width averaging.) 
(b)  To protect the natural functions and aesthetic qualities of a stream and stream buffer, a detailed temporary erosion control plan that identifies the specific mitigating measures to be implemented during construction to protect the water from vegetation removal, erosion, siltation, landslides and hazardous construction materials shall be required. The city of Arlington shall review and approve the plan with the appropriate state, federal and tribal agencies, and any adjacent jurisdiction. 
(c)  In accordance with the Shoreline Master Plan the buffer set-back in the Historic Shoreline Business District is thirty feet landward from the OHWM or top of slope whichever is most protective of the shoreline, and those activities that are allowed under AMC 20.64 Floodplains. 
Table 20.93-3: Non-ESA Stream Buffer Width Stream 
Type 	Standard Buffer 
S 	150 feet 
F-ESA 	150 feet 
F 	100 feet 
Np 	50  feet 
Ns 	50  feet 
Non-natural 	None 
 
(d)  The applicant shall dedicate to the city an exclusive environmentally critical area easement for the protection of creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, or other surface water over the environmentally critical area and a buffer consistent with the standards listed in subsection (a). 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.740 - Mitigation. 
(a)  In order to avoid significant environmental impacts for those activities not regulated by the Shoreline Master Program and allowed pursuant to Section 20.93.720 (Streams, Creeks, Rivers, Lakes and Other Surface Water—Allowed activities), the applicant for a land use or development permit will select one or more of the following mitigation action, listed in order of preference. What is considered adequate mitigation will depend on the nature and magnitude of the potential impact. 
(1)  On-site environmentally critical area restoration/improvement—Restoration or improvement in functional value of degraded on-site waterways and/or their buffers at a two to one ratio (two square feet for every one square foot impacted). 
(2)  On-site ECA/Creation—Creation of on-site waterways and their buffers at a two to one ratio (two square feet for every one square foot impacted). 
(3)  On-site ECA buffer restoration—Restoration or improvement in functional value of degraded on-site waterway buffers at a ratio of six to one. 
(b)  All ECA restoration, creation and/or enhancement projects required pursuant to this chapter either as a permit condition or as the result of an enforcement action shall follow a mitigation plan prepared in conformance to the requirements of Section 20.93.390 (Mitigation plan requirements). 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
Part VIII. - Wetlands 
 
20.93.800 - Classification. 
(a)  Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington, Ecology Publication #14-06-029 or as revised by Ecology. Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists at the time of the adoption of this title or as it exists at the time of an associated permit application. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications. Wetlands identified as having local significance in hydrologic and habitat functions may be rated higher based on importance. 
(b)  Wetland Types. 
(1)  Category I. Category I wetlands are: 
(A)  Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre; 
(B)  Wetlands that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR as wetlands of high conservation value; 
(C)  Bogs; 
(D)  Mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre; 
(E)  Wetlands in coastal lagoons; or 
(F)  Wetlands that perform many functions well and score twenty-three or above. 
Category I wetlands represent a unique or rare wetland type, are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands, are relatively undisturbed and contain some ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime, or provide a very high level of functions. 
(2)  Category II. Category II wetlands are: 
(A)  Estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre; 
(B)  Wetlands with a moderately high level of functions, scoring between twenty and twenty-two points. 
Category II wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than category I wetlands, but they still need a relatively high level of protection. 
(3)  Category III. Category III wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions scoring between sixteen and nineteen points that can be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project. 
Generally, wetlands in this category may have been disturbed in some way and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than category II wetlands. 
(4)  Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions scoring less than sixteen points and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that should be replaceable, and in some cases may be improved. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions and should be protected to some degree. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011; Ord. No. 2016-013, § 12, 7-18-2016)  
20.93.810 - Determination of Boundary. 
(a)  The community development director, relying on a field investigation supplied by an applicant, and applying the wetland definition provided in this chapter shall determine the location of the wetland boundary. Qualified professional and technical scientists shall perform wetland delineations. Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Criteria to be included in required wetland identification reports may be found in Section 20.93.390 (Mitigation plan requirements). The applicant is required to show the location of the wetland boundary on a scaled drawing as a part of the permit application. 
(1)  Designating, defining, and identifying wetlands. Wetlands are those areas, identified in accordance with RCW 90.58.030: "Wetlands" means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from non-wetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands. All areas within the [city/county] meeting the criteria in the wetland definition regardless of whether these areas have previously been identified or mapped, are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this title. 
(2)  Mapping. 
(A)  The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown on the critical area(s) maps adopted in the city of Arlington Comprehensive Plan. Additionally, soil maps produced by U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service may be useful in helping to identify potential wetland areas. These maps are to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants, and/or property owners to identify potential wetland areas that may be subject to the provisions of this title. 
(B)  It is the actual presence of wetlands on a parcel, as delineated by the requirements of the methods in the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements in accordance with WAC 173-22-035, that establishes duties under this chapter. The exact location of a wetland's boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field delineation by a qualified wetlands professional, applying the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements in accordance with WAC 173-22-035. 
(b)  Where the applicant has provided a delineation of the wetland boundary, the community development director shall verify the accuracy of, and may render adjustments to, the boundary delineation. In the event the applicant contests the adjusted boundary delineation, the community development director shall, at the applicant's expense, obtain expert services to render a final delineation. 
(c)  When agreed to by the applicant, the community development director may waive the requirement that the applicant provide the delineation of boundary and rely on staff delineation. The community development director shall consult with qualified professional scientists and technical experts or other experts as needed to perform the delineation. The applicant will be charged for the costs incurred. Where the community development director performs a wetland delineation at the request of the applicant, such delineation shall be considered a final determination. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011)  
20.93.820 - Allowed activities. 
Except where regulated by other sections of this or any other title or law, and provided they are conducted using best management practices, the following uses shall be allowed within wetlands and their buffers when the requirements of Sections 20.93.830 (Wetlands—Requirements) and 20.93.840 (Wetlands—Mitigation) have been met, state and federal approvals have been granted when required, and mitigation adequate to alleviate any other impacts has been proposed: 
Generally uses will be required to avoid and minimize impacts, and compensate for the impact that may reduce the functions of the wetland or its buffers: 
(1)  Those uses listed in Section 20.93.220 (General Provisions—Allowed activities). 
(2)  In Class III and Class IV wetlands only, access to developable portions of legal lots where: 
(A)  There is no other feasible method of accessing the property, 
(B)  Altering the terrain would not cause drainage impacts to neighboring properties, and 
(C)  Not more than two thousand five hundred square feet of wetland is impacted, and mitigated. 
(3)  Permitted uses in a wetland buffer—Regulated activities shall not be allowed in a buffer except for the following: 
(A)  Activities having minimal adverse impacts on buffers and no adverse impacts on regulated wetlands. These may include low intensity, passive recreational activities such as low impact trails in the outer twenty-five percent, non-permanent wildlife watching blinds, short-term scientific or educational activities, and sports fishing; 
(B)  With respect to Category III and IV wetlands, stormwater management facilities having no reasonable alternative on-site location; or 
(C)  With respect to Category III and IV wetlands, development having no feasible alternative location when the following conditions have been met: Impacts are the minimum necessary; Buffer impacts are mitigated through buffer averaging. 
(4)  Those activities and uses conducted pursuant to the Washington State Forest Practices Act and its rules and regulations, WAC 222-12-030, where state law specifically exempts local authority, except those developments requiring local approval for Class 4—General Forest Practice Permits (conversions) as defined in RCW 76.09 and WAC 222-12: 
(A)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and/or other wildlife that does not entail changing the structure or functions of the existing wetland. 
(B)  The harvesting of wild crops in a manner that is not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the harvesting does not require tilling of soil, planting of crops, chemical applications, or alteration of the wetland by changing existing topography, water conditions, or water sources. 
(C)  Drilling for utilities/utility corridors under a wetland, with entrance/exit portals located completely outside of the wetland buffer, provided that the drilling does not interrupt the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column. Specific studies by a hydrologist are necessary to determine whether the ground water connection to the wetland or percolation of surface water down through the soil column will be disturbed. 
(D)  Enhancement of a wetland through the removal of non-native invasive plant species. Removal of invasive plant species shall be restricted to hand removal unless permits from the appropriate regulatory agencies have been obtained for approved biological or chemical treatments. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of. Plants that appear on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board list of noxious weeds must be handled and disposed of according to a noxious weed control plan appropriate to that species. Re-vegetation with appropriate native species at natural densities is allowed in conjunction with removal of invasive plant species. 
(E)  Educational and scientific research activities. 
(F)  Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facilities within an existing right-of-way, provided that the maintenance or repair does not expand the footprint of the facility or right-of-way and impacts are mitigated. 
(G)  Stormwater Management Facilities. Stormwater management facilities are limited to stormwater dispersion outfalls and bioswales. They may be allowed within the outer twenty-five percent of category II, III or IV wetland buffers when in an already developed state including buildings, parking lots, lawn or ornamental landscaping stormwater management systems designed to blend into the natural landscape allowing full mature growth of native trees and shrubs, and provide the same or greater functional habitat that would occur in a naturally vegetated buffer. Specifically, this does not include buried vaults, ecology block or grass-lined ponds or swales (though ponds or swales planted with native vegetation may be allowed). Such systems are required to provide diffuse effluent point(s) to the immediate edge of the no-touch buffer to allow infiltration and polishing, provided that: 
(i)  No other location is feasible; and 
(ii)  The location of such facilities will not degrade the functions or values of the wetland; and 
(iii)  Stormwater management facilities are not allowed in intact buffers of category I wetlands. 
(H)  Nonconforming uses. Repair and maintenance of nonconforming uses or structures, where legally established within the buffer, provided they do not increase the degree of nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 2011-029, § 1, 12-5-2011; Ord. No. 2016-013, §§ 13, 14, 7-18-2016)  
20.93.830 - Requirements. 
(a)  Buffers—ECA buffers shall be required for all regulated activities adjacent to regulated wetlands as provided in Table 20.93-4, unless modified per subsection (b). Any wetland created, restored, or enhanced as compensation for approved wetland alterations shall also include the standard buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced wetland. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as determined pursuant to Section 20.93.810 (Wetlands—Determination of boundary). The width of the wetland buffer zone shall be determined according to wetland category and the proposed land use. These buffers have been established to reflect the impact of land use intensity on wetland functions and values. 
(b)  The standard buffer widths in Table 20.93-4 have been established in accordance with the best available science. They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington state wetland rating system for Western Washington. 
(1)  The use of the standard buffer width requires the implementation of the measures in Table 20.93-5, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses. 
(2)  If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 20.93-5 or other sections of this document, then a thirty-three percent increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a seventy-five-foot buffer with the mitigation measures would be a one hundred-foot buffer without them. 
(3)  The standard buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided. 
(4)  Additional buffer widths are added to the standard buffer widths as indicated in Table 20.93-4. 
(c)  The applicant shall dedicate to the city an exclusive environmentally critical area easement for the protection of wetlands over the environmentally critical area and a buffer consistent with the standards listed in subsection (a).

20.93.840 - Mitigation. 
(a)  In order to avoid significant environmental impacts, the applicant for a land use or development permit shall compensate for unavoidable wetland impacts, listed in order of preference. What is considered adequate mitigation will depend on the nature and magnitude of the potential impact. 
(1)  On-site wetlands restoration/improvement—Restoration or improvement in functional value of degraded on-site wetlands and/or their buffers at the ratio listed in Table 20.93-6 according to the wetland type. 
(2)  On-site wetlands creation—Creation of on-site wetlands and their buffers at the ratio listed in Table 20.93-6 according to the wetland type. 
(3)  On-site wetlands buffer restoration—Restoration or improvement in functional value of degraded on-site wetland buffers at the ratio listed in Table 20.93-6 according to the wetland type. 
(4)  Off-site wetlands protection—Where on-site protection is not possible, dedicate an exclusive easement for the protection of equivalent (in ecological type and function) wetland and its buffer on an off-site wetland at the ratio listed in Table 20.93-6 according to the wetland type. The location of any off-site wetland mitigation area shall be located within the same watershed as the impact and as near to the site as possible, following this preferred order: 
(A)  Contiguous to the impacted wetland, 
(B)  Within the same drainage basin where it would best provide the same function as the impacted wetland, and 
(C)  Elsewhere within the city. 
(b)  All wetland restoration, creation and/or enhancement projects required pursuant to this chapter either as a permit condition or as the result of an enforcement action shall follow a mitigation plan prepared in conformance to the requirements of Section 20.93.390 (Mitigation plan requirements). 
(c)  Location of mitigation. When compensatory measures are appropriate pursuant to the mitigation priority sequence above, preferential consideration shall be given to measures that replace the impacted functions directly and in the immediate vicinity of the impact. However, alternative compensatory mitigation within the watershed sub-basin that addresses limiting factors or identified critical needs for shoreline resource conservation based on watershed or comprehensive resource management plans applicable to the area of impact may be authorized. If there are no previously identified mitigation opportunities in the impacted sub-basin identified in local watershed or comprehensive plans the applicant will use a watershed approach in selecting mitigation sites utilizing Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Publication #09-06-32). Authorization of compensatory mitigation measures may require appropriate safeguards, terms, or conditions as necessary to ensure no net loss of ecological functions (WAC 173-26-201(2)(e)(ii)(B)). 
(d)  Mitigation ratios for the replacement of impacted wetlands shall be as listed in Table 20.93-6.

Therefore, the burden of proof for justifying a proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan or zoning map of the city rests with the applicant. The city council's approval, modification, deferral, or denial of an amendment proposal shall be based on the following criteria: 
(1)  The amendment represents a matter appropriately addressed through the comprehensive plan, and the proposed amendment demonstrates a public benefit and enhances the public health, safety and welfare of the city. 
(2)  The amendment does not raise policy or land use issues that are more appropriately addressed by an ongoing work program approved by the city council. 
(3)  The proposed amendment addresses significantly changed conditions since the last time the pertinent comprehensive plan map or text was amended. "Significantly changed conditions" are those resulting from unanticipated consequences of an adopted policy, or changed conditions on the subject property or its surrounding area, or changes related to the pertinent comprehensive plan map or text, where such change has implications of a magnitude that need to be addressed for the comprehensive plan to function as an integrated whole. 
(4)  The proposed amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan and other goals and policies of the city, the countywide planning policies, the Growth Management Act, other state or federal law, and the Washington Administrative Code and other applicable law.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-006, § 7, adopted March 21, 2016, amended § 20.96.060 to read as set out herein. Previously § 20.96.060 was titled "Council action on amendments."  
20.96.070 - Council action on comprehensive plan and zoning map amendments. 
(a)  At the conclusion of its consideration on a proposed amendment, the council may proceed to vote on the proposed ordinance, remand back to the planning commission for further study , or take any other action consistent with its usual rules of procedure. 
(b)  The council is not required to take final action on a proposed amendment within any specific period of time, but it should proceed as expeditiously as practicable on petitions for amendments since inordinate delays can result in the petitioner incurring unnecessary costs. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)

20.96.080 - Ultimate issue before council on amendments. 
In deciding whether to adopt a proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan or zoning map, the central issue before the council is whether the proposed amendment advances the public health, safety, or welfare. All other issues are irrelevant, and all information related to other issues at the public hearing may be declared irrelevant by the presiding official and excluded. In particular, when considering proposed map or zoning amendments: 
(1)  The council shall not consider any representations made by the petitioner that if the change is granted the rezoned property will be used for only one of the possible range of uses permitted in the requested classification. Rather, the council shall consider whether the entire range of permitted uses in the requested classification is more appropriate than the range of uses in the existing classification. 
(2)  The council shall not regard as controlling any advantages or disadvantages to the individual requesting the change, but shall consider the impact of the proposed change on the public at large. 
(3)  The council shall consider comprehensive plan amendments and zoning map amendments as recommended by the planning commission using the criteria established in Section 20.96.060. If there are substantial changes to the proposed amendments after the public hearing by the planning commission, a second public hearing before the council may be required. If there are no substantial changes, the council may choose whether or not to hold another public hearing. The city shall transmit a copy of the comprehensive plan amendments to department of commerce within ten days of the city council's final adoption.

20.96.100 - Docketing procedures—Amendments to development regulations. 
(a)  All proposed text amendments to the development or zoning regulations shall be developed, submitted and presented by the city staff, based on direction from the city council, planning commission, or the director of community & economic development or designee. 
(b)  Private Party Requests. City staff shall submit proposals from private individuals or groups as follows: 
(1)  Private parties shall submit a written summary of the amendment proposed to city staff, an indication of why it is needed, and the potential land use impacts if approved. No fees shall be assessed. 
(2)  Staff shall maintain a docket listing of private party requests, and shall provide the listing not less than once per year to the Planning Commission, which shall determine which items shall be further reviewed by staff and submitted as a formal proposal, which shall be deferred to future work programs, and which shall not be considered. Decisions to defer or not consider private requests shall be considered final unless appealed as provided herein. 
(c)  Most development regulation amendments shall be processed concurrently with the comprehensive planning docket developed under Subsection 20.96.030(b). The community development director may direct that development regulation amendments proceed separately when deemed appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2016-006, § 10, 3-21-2016)  
20.96.110 - Notice to department of commerce.

20.98.040 - Designation of responsible official. 
(a)  For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the community development director. 
(b)  For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the "lead agency" or "responsible official" by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference above. 
(c)  The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules (WAC Chapter 197-11) and make them available in accordance with RCW Chapter 42.17.

(b)  When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS. 
(c)  When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental review under WAC 197-11-600. 
(d)  If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to that determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within fifteen days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the department of ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the fifteen-day time period. The city's responsible official may initiate any such petition on behalf of the city. 
(e)  Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement.

The state agency with jurisdiction appearing first on the priority listing in WAC-11-936 shall be the lead agency and the city shall be an agency with jurisdiction. To transfer lead agency duties, the city's responsible official must transmit a notice of the transfer together with any relevant information available on the proposal to the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. The responsible official of the city shall also give notice of the transfer to the private applicant and any other agencies with jurisdiction over the proposal. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)

(Ord. 1411 § 20, 2007; Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003).  
20.98.100 - Use of exemptions 
(a)  Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal, shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal are exempt. The department's determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal. 
(b)  In determining whether a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department's consideration is exempt. 
(c)  If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter except that: 
(1)  The city shall not give authorization for: 
(A)  Any nonexempt action; 
(B)  Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or 
(C)  Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives 
(2)  A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. 
(3)  A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.98.110 - Environmental checklist. 
(a)  Except as provided in Subsection (d) of this section, a completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city/county and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city/county is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination. 
(b)  For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal. 
(c)  The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs: 
(1)  The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or, 
(2)  The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. 
(d)  For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the city shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part of a planned action ordinance; or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to the Department of Ecology to allow at least a thirty-day review prior to use. 
(Ord. 1309 § 5(part), 2003)  
20.98.120 - Mitigated DNS. 
(a)  As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant. 
(b)  An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must: 
(1)  Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is a lead agency; and 
(2)  Precede the city's actual threshold determination for the proposal. 
(c)  The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within fifteen working days. The response shall: 
(1)  Be written; 
(2)  State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and 
(3)  State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications. 
(d)  As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures. 
(e)  When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within fifteen days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal: 
(1)  If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340 (2); 
(2)  If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate; 
(3)  The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes, or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are inadequate, whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibels" or "construct two-hundred-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location" are adequate; 
(4)  Mitigation measures that justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies, or other documents. 
(f)  A mitigated DNS is issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a fourteen-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application. 
(g)  Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. 
(h)  If the city's tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS). 
(i)  The city's written response under Subsection (b) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarification or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarification or changes in its threshold determination.

(a)  Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEIS and FEIS) and draft and final supplemental EISs (SEIS) is the responsibility of the city staff under the direction of the responsible official. Before the city issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter and WAC Chapter 197-11. 
(b)  The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by city staff, the applicant, or by a consultant selected by the city or the applicant. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the city will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the city's procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution. 
(c)  The city may require an applicant to provide information the city does not possess, including specific investigations, however, the applicant is not required to supply information that is not requested from another agency.

(a)  Whenever possible, the city shall integrate the public notice required under this section with existing notice procedures for the city's nonexempt permit(s) or approval(s) required for the proposal. 
(b)  Whenever the city issues a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2) or a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3) the city shall give public notice as follows: 
(1)  If public notice is required for a nonexempt action, the notice shall state whether a DS or DNS has been issued and when comments are due. 
(2)  If an environmental document is issued concurrently with the notice of application, the public notice requirements for the notice of application in RCW 36.70B.110(4) will suffice to meet the SEPA public notice requirements in WAC 197-11-510(1). 
(3)  If no public notice is required for the permit or approval, the city shall give notice of the DNS or DS by: 
(A)  Posting the property, for site-specific proposals; and 
(B)  Publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, city, or general area where the proposal is located. 
(C)  Additional public notice may also be given through the following methods: 
(i)  Notifying public or private groups which have expressed interest in a certain proposal or in the type of proposal being considered; 
(ii)  Publishing notice in agency newsletters and/or sending notice to agency mailing lists (either general lists or lists for specific proposals for subject areas); or 
(iii)  Publishing on the city's official web site. 
(4)  Whenever the city issues a DS under WAC 197-11-360 (3), the city shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in the DS as required in WAC 197-11-408 and in the public notice. 
(c)  If a DNS is issued using the optional DNS process, the public notice requirements for a notice of application in RCW 36.70B.110(4) as supplemented by the requirements in WAC 197-11-355 will suffice to meet the SEPA public notice requirements in WAC 197-11-510 (1)(b). 
(d)  Whenever the city issues a DEIS under WAC 197-11-455(5) or a SEIS under WAC 197-11-620, notice of the availability of those documents shall be given by:

Chapter 20.102 - ELIGIBLE FACILITIES MODIFICATIONS 
 
20.102.010 - Title. 
This chapter shall be known and referred to as the "Eligible Facilities Modification Code" or "EFM Code". Unless the context indicates otherwise, a reference herein to "this code" or "this chapter" shall mean and refer to the Eligible Facilities Modification Code. 
(Ord. No. 2016-012, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.102.020 - Adoption of findings and conclusions. 
The recitals set forth in the ordinance adopting this code are adopted as findings and conclusions of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2016-012, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.102.030 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of this chapter are: 
(1)  To implement Section 6409 of the "Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012" (the "Spectrum Act") (PL-112-96; codified at 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a)) which requires the city to approve any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station; 
(2)  To implement the FCC rules set forth at 47 C.F.R. Part 1 (PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE) new Subpart CC Section 1.40001 (Wireless Facility Modifications), which rules implement Section 6409 of the Spectrum Act; 
(3)  To establish procedural requirements and substantive criteria applicable to review and approval or denial of applications for an eligible facilities modification; 
(4)  To ensure that application submittal requirements are related to information reasonably necessary to the determination of whether or not the proposed modification will result in a substantial change in the physical dimensions of the eligible support structure; 
(5)  To exempt facilities modifications approved under this chapter as eligible facilities requests from zoning and development regulations that are inconsistent with or preempted by Section 6409 of the Spectrum Act; 
(6)  To preserve the city's right to continue to enforce and condition approvals under this chapter on compliance with generally applicable building, structural, electrical, and safety codes and with other laws codifying objective standards reasonably related to health and safety; 
(7)  To promote timely decisions under this chapter; 
(8)  To ensure that decisions are made consistently and predictably; 
(9)  To incorporate provisions of RCW 43.21C.0384 that exempt eligible facilities modifications from review under RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c), (State Environmental Policy Act); 
(10)  To recognize that Section 6409(a)(1) of the Spectrum Act operates to preempt any provision of the State Environmental Policy Act (RCW Chapter 43.21C) to the extent that any such provision, including RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c), would prohibit a city from approving any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station; and 
(11)  To provide for termination of eligible facilities modifications approved pursuant to this chapter, as nonconforming structures in the event that Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise determined to be invalid or unenforceable and such modifications would otherwise have been in derogation of development regulations in place at the time of receipt of a completed application. 
(Ord. No. 2016-012, § 1, 7-18-2016)

(Ord. No. 2016-012, § 1, 7-18-2016)  
20.102.050 - Application review. 
(a)  Application. The city shall prepare and make publicly available an application form which shall be limited to the information necessary for city to consider whether an application is an eligible facilities request. The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or business case for the proposed modification. 
(b)  Type of Review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible facilities request pursuant to this chapter, [identify appropriate department—e.g., public works, planning] shall review such application to determine whether the application so qualifies. 
(c)  Timeframe for Review. Within sixty days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval under this chapter, city shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this chapter. 
(d)  Tolling of the Timeframe for Review. The sixty-day review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement by city and the applicant, or in cases where [jurisdiction's reviewing body] determines that the application is incomplete. The timeframe for review is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications. 
(1)  To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, city must approve written notice to the applicant within thirty days of receipt of the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the application. 
(2)  The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to city's notice of incompleteness. 
(3)  Following a supplemental submission, city will notify the applicant within ten days that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this subsection (d). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 
(e)  Interaction With Section 332(c)(7). If city determines that the applicant's request is not covered by Section 6409(a) as delineated under this chapter, the presumptively reasonable timeframe under Section 332(c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's Shot Clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of city's decision that the application is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, city may request additional information from the applicant to evaluate the application under Section 332(c)(7), pursuant to the limitations applicable to other Section 332(c)(7) reviews. 
(f)  Failure to Act. In the event city fails to approve or deny a request seeking approval under this chapter within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the applicable reviewing authority in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. 
(g)  Remedies. Applicants and city may bring claims related to Section 6409(a) to any court of competent jurisdiction.

Chapter 20.110 - Mixed Use Development Regulations 
Sections: 
 
20.110.012 - Introduction. 
(a)  Purpose. Under state law, local jurisdictions are allowed to define a vision for specific areas within their boundaries and apply regulations and guidelines for implementation of those visions. It can establish clear policies, implementation strategies, and design standards to guide public and private investment in a coordinated manner. 
For the foreseeable future, the city's urban growth boundary will remain fixed in its current configuration. The immediate effect of an inelastic city edge will be that projected population increases will be absorbed by in-filling, rather than expansion. To maintain the high-quality city that is described in the vision statement and comprehensive plan, the community will have to take a new look at land use patterns and how it intends guide the built environment. 
Local development history has shown that conventional (Euclidean) zoning has not, and likely will not, provide a path from the vision, goals, and policies expressed in the comprehensive plan to the creation of quality places. 
Mixed use development regulations provides guidance for the creation of quality places that will provide interesting, walkable neighborhoods, while preserving the city's small-town feel. It is intended to guide initiatives that capitalize on the city's unique assets with the overarching goal of seamlessly accommodating growth. The plan is designed to create centers of commercial and residential activity appropriate to local context and use intensities with a predictable built form. In addition, the plan provides options for developers that result in expedited, predictable outcomes. 
(b)  Planning with Form Based Code. Quality place making is a derivative of the concepts and tools contained in the alternative approach to conventional zoning called "form based code". These concepts reinforce walkable, sustainable mixed-use environments and development that builds upon community character. This strategic plan uses the form based coding approach to achieve the community's goals of sustainability and context sensitive, high-quality infill. 
"Form-based codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle for the code. These codes are adopted into city or county law as regulations, not mere guidelines. Form-based codes are an alternative to conventional zoning." 
~ Form-Based Codes Institute 
An important aspect of this definition that differentiates form based codes from conventional zoning is the phrase "by using physical form." This does not mean that use is not important, but instead of land use always being the organizing principle for the overall code, within the FBC elements of this plan, the intended physical form, or characteristics of desired place becomes the primary organizing principle. 
It is also important to note that while FBCs focus on an intended physical form, they also regulate use. FBCs often allow a range of uses that are carefully chosen to maximize compatibility between uses and the intended physical form of the specific neighborhood. 
FBC components are integrated throughout this plan. The following is an explanation of these components and where they are located in this zoning code. 
(1)  Place types provide the basic building form standards and list the allowed building types, sustainable features and permitted uses within a specific geographical area. See subsection 20.110.014(c)(1)—(5) (place types). 
(2)  Building types provide a fine level of detail about the appropriate massing and form of buildings within a place type. See subsection 20.110.014(e) (building types). 
(3)  Private frontage types provide detail on how a building relates to the street or public realm. See subsection 20.110.014(d) (private frontage types). 
(4)  Thoroughfare types provide the components of a thoroughfare that can be used to create walkable streets that balance the needs of vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists. See subsection 20.110.014(f) (block, street, and rights of way). 
(5)  Civic spaces provide standards for a broad range of civic spaces and open space. A significant focus of the city's new and existing civic spaces will be the creative incorporation of public art. See subsection 20.110.014(i) (civic and open space). 
(c)  How to Use the Plan. In graphic form, this section illustrates the basic steps to follow in using this form based code as a part of the regulations guiding development within the mixed use overlay district. This is illustrative only and is not intended to set forth the administration and procedures which are described more fully in subsection 20.110.014(k) (administration and procedures).

(d)  Place Types. Place types are defined by their location and by their intensity of use. They are calibrated by their: 
• Street Types, 
• Block and Street Types, 
• Building Placement and Mass, 
• Frontage Types, and 
• Architectural Features. 
 
This transect describes six use intensities from natural to sub-urban to urban core. Each level of use, or T-zone, has a unique built form, consistent with its use intensity and context. Some jurisdictions have added sub-transects, some have modified their definitions, and some have labelled the intensities with their own vocabulary. By whatever method it is described, intensity of use is at the core of place definition. While transects can be used as a regional planning tool, it is uniquely suited to describe the more geographically limited and more intense urban environment. 
This mixed use development overlay plan creates four "place type" overlay descriptions; neighborhood corridor, neighborhood community center, neighborhood village center and urban center. In addition, due to their unique development context, two special districts were created. Special district 1 contains primarily freeway oriented commercial development. It is highly unlikely that residential development, other than vertical mixed use, will become a significant element of growth in this area. Special district 2 is located in an area where residential use is prohibited, therefore its mix of uses will exclude any residential component. In addition, there are three other areas included in the mixed use overlay, but are geographically too small to be assigned a place type. Growth in these areas will nonetheless be guided by a regulating plan. In the city's urban context, these place types and special Districts articulate in detail the transition from more intense to less concentrated uses. Each place type contains its own unique combination of neighborhood use transitions. As a group, these four place types contain all of the commercial, residential, and civic space use intensities required for the next twenty years. 
Because the city is a small, urban edge city, the two least intense and the one highest intensity transects are not applicable to our future built form; at least not for now. Zone T3, translates into most of our existing neighborhood and municipal structure. Zone T4 splits into four use intensities; T4 neighborhood small volume, T4 neighborhood medium volume, T4 main street, and T4 flex. A mix of these four intensities is applied to the neighborhood corridor, neighborhood community center and neighborhood village center. The T5 neighborhood medium volume, T5 neighborhood large volume, T5 main street and the T5 flex contained in the urban center provides the relatively high intensities of use the city will need to accommodate our projected population and commercial growth. The special districts reflect areas with limited or prohibited residential potential, and therefore will follow other mixed use patterns, remaining within transect regulated intensities. 
In subsection 20.110.014(c) that follows, the individual place types are specifically located within the city. In subsection 20.110.014(c), are the sub-transects and definitions appropriate to each place type. The specific distribution of sub-transects within each place type is accomplished with the city regulating plan. The regulating plan is essentially a fine grained zoning map combined with a street plan and an open space plan, keyed to the development code's standards and guidelines. The regulating plan accomplishes two tasks: 
• Based on existing context and projected need and markets, The regulating plan locates place type overlays to specific areas of the city, and 
• The regulating plan assigns specific transect and sub-transect intensities to individual streets and blocks within each located place type. 
In most of the quality places being created around the country, walkability and pedestrian friendliness are basic design criteria. The four Arlington Place types all share these features, but in different contexts and with different forms. All four have clearly defined centers and edges. Centers are street intersections in some cases, and parks in others. Edges are defined by either a standard walkable one-quarter-mile, or an elongated one-half-mile "pedestrian shed". As they grow, some of the smaller places will overlap others and may at some time in the future become combined to create places of more intense uses and built forms. Areas that are initially defined as corridors will eventually become a linear series of smaller walkable neighborhoods. 
A pedestrian shed is the basic building block of walkable neighborhoods. A ped shed is the area encompassed by the walking distance from a neighborhood center. Ped sheds are often defined as the area covered by a five-minute walk (about one-quarter miles, one thousand three hundred twenty feet, or four hundred meters). They may be drawn as perfect circles, but in practice ped sheds have irregular shapes because they cover the actual distance walked, not the linear (aerial) distance. A synonym for ped shed is walkable catchment. 
Pedestrian safety is greatest when vehicle speeds are low. On-street parking, trees, and other design elements are a buffer between pedestrians and traffic. Sidewalks are sized appropriately for the number of walkers. Buildings meet the street in such a way to make the "outdoor rooms" that are the mark of the best urban places. Building façades are human scale, with frequent doorways and windows, and attractive details and ornament. 
A well designed neighborhood should be pedestrian friendly, but also accommodate bicyclists, transit riders, cars, and appropriate delivery and larger vehicles. Open space and buildings at human scale are an integral part of overall Place design. Density and land use will generally, but not always, vary from the core to the edge of a neighborhood walkable area. 
In the sections that follow, the built environment will be calibrated for each of the four place types, based on their unique physical and geographical contexts and their projected use intensities.

General use 
To provide a mix of non-residential commercial uses compatible with adjacent mixed use residential to the West and business park development to the North and East. 
Intent 
Special District-2 is totally contained on airport property. As such, it is subject to several layers of federal regulations. To prevent the potential for incompatible land uses adjacent to airports, these regulations prohibit the inclusion of residential units on Airport property. This area is ideally suited for a mix of commercial activity that is appropriate to the intensities of adjoining development. 
(f)  The Plan Area. The place types which are specifically allocated are all contained within the existing city limits, primarily within highway commercial land use zones. There are four major mixed use focus areas, each with its own configuration, size, and unique use intensity combinations. There are also two special districts: Special District-1 contains primarily freeway oriented commercial development; Special District-2 is located in an area where residential use is prohibited, therefore its mix of uses will exclude any residential component. In addition, there are three other areas included in the mixed use overlay, but are geographically too small to be assigned a place type. Growth in these areas will nonetheless be guided by a regulating plan. Figure 20.110-A shows the location of the place types, special districts, and the areas too small for place types. 
Figure 20.110-A 
 
(g)  Overview of Existing Conditions. During the 2015 comprehensive plan update process, it became apparent that to accommodate the twenty-year projected population increase, one of two planning regimes had to be followed. The first was to increase residential buildable land by simply expanding the city's boundaries. The second involved re-defining commercially zoned permissible uses to provide for both commercial and residential growth. The city is required to accommodate approximately three thousand residential units within the next twenty years. Currently the land zoned for residential development will provide just over three hundred units. There needed to be a plan to account for this shortfall. 
Having to meet a variety of conditions, the city selected the second option. Clearly, for this option to be viable, some alternate regulatory plan for the uses of commercial property needed to be established. To enable this option, the city subsequently adopted a mixed use overlay that included all the commercial property within its UGA. Computer modeling showed that the application of mixed uses to most of the commercial areas of the city would adequately accommodate both the projected population growth as well as the supporting commercial activity. 
The eventual built form of population absorption by in-filling has shown to be unpredictable without design standards organized around some unifying principle. This mixed use development regulations incorporates many of the planning and design concepts contained in form based code. 
Typically, in the development of a form based code, careful consideration is given to existing conditions. Topography, existing building typology, thoroughfare standards, and civic spaces are thoroughly and systematically analyzed to enable the coding of the contextual DNA of each affected neighborhood. With few exceptions, the commercial areas of the city which are contained within the mixed use overlay are either undeveloped or significantly underdeveloped. Lacking essential neighborhood context, the city had to look elsewhere for guidance in the formulation of the city's future built environment. 
The regulations that follow reflect planning for a twenty-year economic and population growth molded primarily by the vision, goals, and policies of the 2015 Arlington Comprehensive Plan. 
(h)  Plan Preparation and Public Participation. By February of 2016, work had begun on adjustments to the 2015 comprehensive plan update to redraft population absorption strategies and rework a few sections based on department of commerce and Puget Sound Regional Council feedback on the original document. The city was considering an ordinance to extend mixed use zoning from old town to include all commercially zoned property within its UGA. Recognizing that community input would play a significant role in the definition of these extended mixed use zones, the department of community development, along with the planning commission formed a focus group to provide guidance for the formulation of the standards that would regulate these new areas. 
The focus group was composed of community leaders from a diverse cross section of the private sector, along with city council members and planning commissioners with support from community development staff. The group was charged with providing guidance and feedback for the regulation regime and the public outreach program that would ultimately determine the effectiveness and future livability of the mixed use areas. 
The focus group meet weekly for eighteen months. Initially, each meeting was structured in two parts; on-line planning courses with a focus on form based code, followed by a discussion of the tools and processes of FBC and how they might be applied to the new mixed use areas. 
As sections of the draft form based code were developed, the focus group provided comments and their suggestions for improvements. This feedback became an instrumental part of the editing and updating process. As this process was nearing its conclusion, the focus group was asked to assist with the development of an outreach program to take the draft FBC regulations out to the community for public feedback. The details of the outreach plan that was formulated with focus group feedback are in the appendix. 
Three outreach sessions were held in May of 2017 in various locations in the city, and another three sessions were held in July. In each session, there was a presentation of the plan for mixed use development, followed by discussion with participants. Contact information was obtained for future feedback opportunities. 
(i)  Goals. The city's comprehensive plan divides the city into twelve sub-areas. Each of these sub-areas has a unique built environment, a unique mix of uses, a unique topography, or a combination of all three. As the city grows and develops, some of these areas will remain relatively stable and some will transition into new looks and new uses. The city is going to grow; that's not optional for any Washington city. The city will need to provide a place for young people entering the labor market, in-migration of established workers and their families, and homes for a rapidly increasing retired population. Seven thousand people are coming. The quality of the places created for them will directly affect their lives and the lives of people already here. Most of the growth, both in people and in commerce will happen in the transitional neighborhood sub areas. These are the places detailed in the regulating plan. 
For the purposes of creating a vision of mixed uses within a design based context, these transitional neighborhoods need to be the fundamental unit of city wide planning. Neighborhoods should be places where people can live, work, shop, and recreate. Their buildings, streets, public and private places need to relate well to one another by plan, not by accident. These neighborhoods should be sized so that an average person can walk from its center to its fringe in five to ten minutes. 
Thoroughfare network connectivity is perhaps the single most important element of sustainably-built cities. The thoroughfare network is simply the system of streets, alleys, walkways and trails in an area. Connectivity refers to the directness of travel routes and the number of alternate routes between any two locations. Vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian connectivity in our proposed mixed use neighborhoods are addressed by this urban form development code. 
(Ord. No. 2017-021, § 1, 12-18-2017)  
20.110.014 - Development code. 
(a)  Authority and Purpose. This code protects and promotes the public health, comfort, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the community and implements the city comprehensive plan. 
Parcels that are subject to regulations of both a specific local place type as contained in this mixed use overlay plan and of its underlying land use zone may be developed using the regulations of either set, but not a mixture of the two. Examples of areas where the overlay plan is an option include the village center at Kent Prairie, the neighborhood corridor along Smokey Point Boulevard, the urban center in the Smokey Point commercial area, and the community center at Highway 9 and 172 nd . 
These two sets of regulations represent significantly different approaches to the challenges presented with population absorption by in-filling. The underlying "by right" regulations are use based and depend on design guidelines rather than standards to determine the eventual built form. This combination rarely produces predictable outcomes for either the developer or for the city. Applications based on the underlying zoning will follow the administrative processes and regulations described in the relevant portions of this Title 20. In particular, subdivisions will follow the regulations contained in Section 20.16.300 (major and short subdivisions). Section 20.16.350 (binding site plans) will not be available for development governed by the underlying zoning regulations. 
This overlay plan is form based, with specific textual and graphic descriptions for the desired outcome, along with administrative procedures that represent significant time savings along with a more predictable review process. The provisions of this overlay plan will regulate development in the mixed use overlay district when the overlay plan option is chosen. In the event of conflict between the overlay plan and the underlying zoning, the provisions of the overlay plan shall control. The choice of either the regulations contained in the overlay plan or of the underlying zoning shall be made by the owner of the property, an authorized agent of the owner, a person acting in compliance with a purchase contract or other written consent and shall follow the land. 
(1)  Conflicting Provisions. If any provision of this overlay plan contains an actual, implied, or apparent conflict with another provision of this overlay plan, the more restrictive provision controls. 
(2)  Relationship to Other Regulations. 
(A)  Where conditions, standards, or requirements imposed by any provision of this overlay plan are either more restrictive or less restrictive than the standard imposed by any other statute, law, ordinance, regulation, license, or permit, the most restrictive of any such standards control. 
(B)  Whenever a provision of this overly plan refers to any other part of this Code or to other law, the reference applies to any subsequent amendment of that law. 
(3)  Severability. If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision of this overly plan is adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, that judgement does not affect, impair, invalidate, or nullify the remainder of this overlay plan. The effect of the judgement is confined to the section, paragraph, subdivision, and clause. Sentence, or provision specifically addressed in the controversy in which the judgement or decree was made. 
(b)  Applicability of Standards Versus Guidelines. 
(1)  Standards are mandatory requirements which are enforced by terms such as "shall" or "will". 
(2)  Guidelines are suggested or encouraged but are not explicitly mandatory. However, their intent represents an objective for development and as such they are intended to be followed in spirit if not literally. Thus guidelines leave flexibility for design creativity to meet the intent of the guideline and are promulgated by terms such as "should" or "may". 
(3)  The existing development regulations of the city shall continue to be applicable to areas and/or zones not covered by this overlay plan. 
(4)  Capitalized items used throughout this plan are defined in sections 3.1 General Definitions, and 3.2 Definitions Specific to Permitted Uses. 
(5)  Maps and charts accompanying this plan are specifically incorporated by reference herein. 
(c)  (1)  Place Types.

Use intensity transects: T4 Main Street (T4-MS), T4 Flex (T4-F), T4 Neighborhood Small Volume (T4N-SV), T4 Neighborhood Medium Volume (T4N-MV). 
T4-MS 
Intent: 
To provide a vibrant main street mixed use residential and commercial environment that serves as the focal point for the surrounding neighborhood and provides access to day-to-day amenities within walking distance in urban form. This mixed use neighborhood corridor will likely develop into a series of smaller, walkable centers along Smokey Point Boulevard which will ultimately provide sustainable transit service along the route.

Primary street with medium intensity commercial activity, along with medium to high density residential, decreasing in intensity toward the adjoining residential neighborhoods. 
Predominate land uses: 
Primary boulevard facing with medium intensity commercial. 
Street types: 
Passage, alley, mixed use street, residential avenue, mixed use avenue, mixed use boulevard, and multiway boulevard. 
T4-F 
Intent: 
To provide an appropriate transition from a neighborhood main street environment into the residential areas, and to provide flexible buildings that can allow a mix of residential and walkable local serving commercial and service uses. 
Characteristics: 
Attached or detached 	Small side setback 
Small to medium front setbacks 	Small to medium lot width 
Small to medium footprint 	Up to three stories 
 
Key features: 
Mix of medium density building types with a variety of forms which decrease in size and intensity of use toward the outer boundary of the center. 
Predominate land uses: 
A mix of uses to transition from the higher intensity commercial and high density residential along the center's main street core to more moderate density and moderate volume residential uses along the edge of the neighborhood corridor. 
Street types: 
Passage, mixed use street, alley, residential street, and mixed use avenue. 
T4N-SV 
Intent: 
To provide a variety of housing choices within the neighborhood corridor, that integrates appropriate small to medium building volume, medium density building types, such as duplexes, bungalow courts, and small multiplex buildings. This level of intensity reinforces the walkable nature of the neighborhood, supports local serving commercial activity in this mixed use corridor, and encourages public transportation alternatives. 
Characteristics: 
Detached or attached 	Medium to large lot width 
Small to medium front setback 	Small to medium side setback 
Up to two stories 	Primarily stoops or porches 
 
Key features: 
Linear corridors with high connectivity, providing a mix of housing types contained within a walkable street network, adjacent to local serving commercial activity located along primary streets. 
Predominate land uses: 
The primary land use focus of the T4N-SV transect areas within neighborhood corridors is with small to medium density residential in a variety of medium volume formats. Buildings are set back from ROW's, with the possibility of ancillary buildings behind the primary residence. The variety of housing choices reinforce the walkable nature of this residential area. 
Street types: 
Passage, alley, mixed use street, residential street, and residential avenue.

(Ord. No. 2010-016, § 1, 7-19-2010)

(3)  Set forth the obligations of the franchisee under the franchise. 
(Ord. No. 2010-016, § 1, 7-19-2010)  
21.04.050 - Nonexclusive franchise. 
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive and not preclude the city from granting other or future franchise or permits. 
(Ord. No. 2010-016, § 1, 7-19-2010)  
21.04.060 - Application. 
(a)  An applicant for an initial franchise shall submit to the city a written application in a format provided by the city, at the time and place specified by the city for accepting applications, and accompanied by the designated application fee. An application fee as set forth in the adopted fee resolution shall accompany the application to cover costs associated with processing the application, including, without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the applicant, the costs of consultants, notice and publication requirements, and document preparation expenses.

(8)  Any other reasonable information that the city may request. 
(c)  The city shall be allowed the opportunity to ask relevant follow-up questions and obtain further information from any source. A refusal by an applicant to cooperate or provide requested information is sufficient grounds for the city to deny an application. 
(d)  Consideration of initial franchise. Upon receipt of an application for an initial franchise and after obtaining any additional information the city in its sole discretion deems appropriate from any source, a hearing shall be scheduled to allow public comment. At the hearing, the city council shall receive public comment regarding the following:

The city council's decision shall be based upon the application, any additional information submitted by the applicant or obtained by the city from any source, and public comments. The city council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise.

(a)  Policy. A cable operator will first resolve customer inquiries and complaints without delay and without involvement of the city. Where a given complaint is not addressed by the cable operator to the customer's satisfaction, the city may intervene. 
These standards are intended to be of general application. A cable operator is free to exceed these standards for the benefit of its customers. However, the cable operator shall be relieved of obligations hereunder if it is unable to perform due to a force majeure event affecting a significant portion of the franchise area. 
(b)  Customer service. 
(1)  Courtesy. All employees of the cable operator shall be courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful, and shall provide effective and satisfactory service in all contacts with customers. 
(2)  Availability and accessibility—In person. The cable operator must maintain, at a minimum, one customer service center located within twenty-five miles of the Arlington City Limits. This customer service location shall at all times allow customers to make payments, return equipment, or get assistance from knowledgeable staff. The customer service center shall be open Monday through Saturday, excluding legal holidays, with sufficient hours necessary to meet customer demand. The customer service center will be staffed to meet all customer needs with on-site customer service representatives. If, however, the customer service center is required to relocate, the cable operator shall be allowed a reasonable period of time to establish a new location. 
(3)  Availability and accessibility—On the telephone. A CSR will be available to respond to customer inquiries during normal business hours. The cable operator shall maintain local or toll free telephone access lines that shall be available during normal business hours for service/repair requests and billing inquiries. The cable operator shall retain sufficient CSRs and telephone line capacity to ensure that, during normal operating conditions, telephone calls to service/repair and billing inquiry lines are answered within thirty seconds or less, and that any transfers are made within thirty seconds. This standard shall be met no less than ninety percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis under normal operating conditions. Under normal operating conditions, the total number of calls receiving busy signals shall not exceed three percent of the total telephone calls. The cable operator shall not be required to acquire equipment or perform surveys to measure compliance with any of the telephone answering standards above unless and until the city requests such actions based on a historical record of customer complaints indicating a clear failure to comply. 
(c)  Responsiveness. 
(1)  The cable operator shall complete all standard aerial installations within seven days after an order has been placed, unless otherwise requested by the customer. The cable operator shall schedule all standard underground installations within seven days after an order has been placed, unless otherwise requested by the customer. "Standard" installations shall include those that are located within one hundred twenty-five aerial feet or sixty underground trench feet of the cable operator's distribution system. This standard must be met ninety-five percent of the time, under normal operating conditions as measured on a quarterly basis. If the customer requests a non-standard installation, or the cable operator determines that a non-standard installation is required, the cable operator shall provide the customer in advance with a total installation cost estimate and an estimated date of completion. 
(2)  Under normal operating conditions, all temporary cable drops shall be converted to a permanent drop within no more than three calendar weeks from the initial installation, or at a time mutually agreed upon between the cable operator and customer. 
(3)  Customers requesting installation of cable service or repair service to an existing installation may choose any available four hour block of time for the appointment during normal business hours. 
(4)  The cable operator shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under the provisions of this subsection when a technician arrives within the agreed upon time. If the customer is absent when the technician arrives, the technician shall leave written notification of timely arrival. A record that notice was provided shall be kept by the cable operator. 
(5)  If a cable operator representative fails to keep an installation or service appointment for any reason, the cable operator will contact the customer before the end of the scheduled appointment and reschedule the appointment at a time convenient for the customer. 
(6)  The cable operator shall respond to a customer's letter in writing within two weeks of receipt of the letter. The cable operator shall initiate resolution to a customer's inquiry, complaint, general question, or comment made by telephone or email within forty-eight hours. 
(7)  Any difficulties that cannot be resolved by the CSR shall be referred to the appropriate supervisor who shall use his/her best efforts to contact the customer within twenty-four hours of initial contact and resolve the problem within a mutually agreeable timeframe. 
(d)  Repairs and outages. 
(1)  The cable operator shall interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Scheduled interruptions that the cable operator anticipates will last more than four hours shall occur during periods of minimum use of the cable system as reasonably determined by the cable operator. 
(2)  If a customer calls to report poor signal quality or interruptions attributable to the cable operator's equipment, the cable operator shall begin working on the problem no later than the next day following the customer's call, provided that the customer is available, or at such later time as is convenient for the customer. If an appointment is necessary, the customer may choose a four hour block of time during normal business hours. 
(3)  Upon discovery of an outage affecting three or more customers, the cable operator shall initiate its outage repair process within two hours, under normal operating conditions. 
(4)  A cable operator shall initiate repairs to customer reported service interruptions, for any cause beyond the control of the cable operator, within twenty-four hours after the conditions beyond its control have been corrected. 
(5)  Under normal operating conditions, if after twenty-four hours service is not restored to a customer, a cable operator shall, upon a customer's request, provide a refund or credit or other compensation of equal or greater value. 
(6)  The cable operator will track and record all outages and service interruptions that occur within the franchise area. 
(e)  Bills, credits, refunds and deposits. If a customer requests disconnection of any or all services, billing for affected services shall end on the same day as the request, or on the future date for which the disconnect is ordered. However, the customer may continue to be billed for equipment until returned to the cable operator. The cable operator shall issue a credit or refund to a customer within thirty business days after the close of the billing cycle following the return of the equipment and request for disconnection. If a customer was required to provide a deposit, that deposit must be returned when appropriate. 
(f)  Treatment of property. 
(1)  Removal or trimming of trees and shrubs in the right-of-way will be subject to the regulations of the city. 
(2)  The cable operator shall repair any damage or restore any property to as good a condition as before the work causing such damage or disturbance was initiated. The cable operator shall repair, replace, or compensate all property owners for damages resulting from the cable operator's installation, construction, service, or repair activities. 
(3)  Except in the case of an emergency involving public safety or service interruption to a large number of customers, the cable operator shall give reasonable notice to property owners or legal tenants prior to entering upon private premises, and the notice shall specify the work to be performed; provided that, in the case of planned construction operations, such notice shall be delivered or provided at least twenty-four hours prior to entry. All work done in the right-of-way shall be subject to time requirements of the permit. 
(4)  Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing access or entry to private property, or any other property, where such right to access or entry is not otherwise provided by law. 
(5)  For major construction or installation projects, the cable operator shall notify by mail or door hanger the adjacent property owners/legal tenants in advance of the right-of way work. In the case of an emergency, the cable operator shall attempt to contact the property owner or legal tenant in person, and in the event personal contact is not made, the cable operator shall leave a door hanger notice. 
(6)  The cable operator shall clean all areas surrounding any work site of debris caused by the cable operator's activities. 
(g)  Services for customers with disabilities. 
(1)  For any customer with a disability, the cable operator shall upon a customer request and at no charge deliver and/or pick up converters at the customer's home. 
(2)  The cable operator shall provide TDD/TYY service with trained operators who can provide assistance for hearing-impaired customers at no charge. 
(3)  The cable operator shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(2)  The cable operator shall provide customers with written notification of any changes in rates, programming, services, or channel positions as soon as possible in writing. Customers shall be given a description of the changes, a phone number for questions, and the effective date. Notice must be given to customers a minimum of thirty days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the cable operator. 
(3)  All officers, agents, and employees of the cable operator, its contractors, and subcontractors who are in personal contact with customers shall have visible identification cards bearing their name and photograph. 
(4)  Every vehicle of the cable operator, its contractors, and subcontractors, shall be clearly identified to the public as a vehicle of the cable operator. 
(i)  Safety. 
(1)  The cable operator shall install and locate its facilities, cable system, and equipment in compliance with all federal, state, local, and company safety standards, and in such manner as shall not endanger persons or property. 
(2)  Whenever the cable operator receives notice that an unsafe condition exists with respect to its equipment, the cable operator shall investigate such condition immediately, and shall take such measures as are necessary to remove or eliminate any unsafe condition. 
(j)  Complaints to the city. 
(1)  Any customer shall be entitled to lodge any complaint directly with the city. The customer may lodge the complaint either by calling the city or by filing a written complaint by letter or in electronic form. 
(2)  If the city decides that further action is warranted, the city may intercede and attempt to help reach a resolution and/or require the cable operator to address the inquiry in a timely manner. Upon request by the city, the cable operator shall notify the city of the status of the inquiry and any subsequent resolution. 
(3)  The cable operator shall maintain, in a manner consistent with the privacy rights of customers, an accurate and comprehensive file of complaints regarding the cable system or the cable operator's operation of the cable system, by number and type and their disposition; service requests, identifying the number and nature of the requests and their disposition; and outages, service interruptions and their disposition. 
(k)  Remedying violations. If the city has reason to believe that the cable operator has failed to comply with any of these standards, or has failed to perform in a timely manner, or if similar complaints repetitively arise, the city may require in writing that the cable operator remedy the noncompliance. If the noncompliance is not remedied to the satisfaction of the city, the city may opt to follow the liquidated damages procedures or seek other remedies set forth in the franchise, or pursue any other remedies at law or in equity.
