PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Gilmer, Texas. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mary Bates, City Secretary, Michael Martin, City Attorney and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Section 1.04. - Extension of Boundaries. 
The boundaries of the City of Gilmer may be enlarged and extended by the annexation of additional territory, irrespective of size and configuration, in any of the methods hereinafter designated: 
(a)	Extension of City Limits by Petition: Whenever a majority of the legally qualified property owners who are citizens of the State of Texas and inhabitants of any territory adjoining the City of Gilmer, or in case there are no qualified voters in said territory, then, when persons owning a majority of the land in the area to be annexed, may present a written petition requesting annexation to the Council and shall attach to said petition an affidavit of one or more of their number to the effect that said petition is signed by a majority of such qualified voters or, in the case there are no qualified voters, said affidavit shall be to the effect that there are no qualified voters in said territory and that the persons signing the petition own a majority of the land in said territory; and, thereupon the Council, at regular session or in special session held not sooner than thirty (30) days after the presentation of said petition, may, by ordinance, annex such territory to the City of Gilmer and thenceforth the said territory shall be a part of the City of Gilmer and the inhabitants thereof shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges of other citizens and shall be bound by the acts, ordinances, resolutions, and regulations of said City.

Section 1.05. - Rule for Contraction of Boundaries. 
Whenever there exists within the corporate limits of the City of Gilmer any territory not suitable or necessary for orderly planning and development of the City, the City Council may, upon a petition signed by the majority of the qualified voters residing in such territory, if the same be inhabited, or without any such petition, if the same be uninhabited, by ordinance duly passed, discontinue said territory as a part of said City. Said petition and ordinance shall specify accurately the metes and bounds of the territory sought to be eliminated from the City and shall contain a plat designating such territory so that the same can be definitely ascertained. When said ordinance has been duly passed, the same shall be entered upon the minutes and records of the City and, from and after the entry of such ordinances, said territory shall cease to be a part of said City, but said territory shall still be liable for its pro rata share of any debts incurred while said area was a part of said City. Further, the City shall continue to levy, assess, and collect taxes on the property within said territory to pay the indebtedness incurred while said area was a part of the City as though the same had not been excluded from the boundaries of the City,[;] provided however, that in the event such disannexation shall be initiated unilaterally by the City without application of the residents residing within such areas to be disannexed or the owners thereof, then, in such event, the City shall not continue to levy, assess, and collect taxes on such disannexed area as herein provided or in accordance with laws and codes of the State of Texas.

(5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Sec. 10-204. - Zones. 
In order to carry out the provisions of these regulations, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, conical surface, horizontal surface, and transitional surfaces as they apply to the airport. Such surfaces are shown on the City of Gilmer/Gilmer Municipal Airport Hazard Zoning Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by TxDOT Aviation and dated 8-5-05, which is hereby attached to these regulations and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)	Approach zones. Approach zones are hereby established beneath the approach surfaces at each end of Runway 18-36 at the airport for an other than utility runway with non-precision instrument landings. The approach surface shall have an inner edge width of 500 feet, which coincides with the width of the primary surface, at a distance of 200 feet beyond each runway end, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet beyond the end of the primary surface. The centerline of the approach surface is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)	Conical zone. A conical zone is hereby established beneath the conical surface at the airport which extends outward from the periphery of the horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(3)	Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is hereby established beneath the horizontal surface at the airport which is a plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(4)	Transitional zones. Transitional zones are hereby established beneath the transitional surfaces at the airport. Transitional surfaces, symmetrically located on either side of the runway, have variable widths as shown on the Gilmer Municipal Airport-Fox Stephens Field Hazard Zoning Map. Transitional surfaces extend outward perpendicular to the runway centerline and the extended runway centerline from the periphery of the primary surface and the approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal surface.

(Ord. No. 1999-002, § 2(V), 2-25-1999) 
Sec. 70-137. - Proper signage for Gilmer Main Street historic buildings. 
(a)	The following subsections of this section is an excerpt from Neighborhood Commercial District Design Guidelines, published by the Landmark Preservation Council of Illinois, written by Wallace Rappe, AIA, and edited by Emily J. Harris. Many of these suggestions can apply to Gilmer Main Street. 
(b)	Oversized, projecting and crowded signs compete with each other and produce confusion. Guide all signage decisions by remembering that the building itself is the best sign. A sensitively rehabilitated, well-maintained building is the best advertisement for a business's attention to detail and the quality of its products and services. The following ground rules for signage will create positive images for individual businesses, enhance the visual harmony of the shopping district, and create an environment that attracts customers. They may also dramatically cut signage costs. 
(1)	Use flat signs in consistent places. Place signs on the buildings sign frieze, which is the horizontal flat bank above the store windows. Original signs, either on flat signboards or made of individual letters attached to the sign frieze, were designed as an integral part of the building. Limit signs on other areas of the building. 
(2)	Remove most projecting signs. Signs that hang over the sidewalk can be counterproductive to business because they often obscure individual buildings and interrupt the visual harmony of the street. If projecting signs are to be used, it is essential that they be small in scale and that they be coordinated with surrounding buildings and signs. 
(3)	Limit the information on signs. The shortest message on a sign has the most impact on pedestrians. The name of the business and the street number are essential. Symbols or cutouts of familiar objects, such as a pharmacist's mortar and pestle, can communicate a great deal of information without lettering at all. 
(4)	Limit the size of the sign. Do not allow signs to conceal any of the building's ornamental or architectural features. Adjust the size of the message to the distance that the shopper is from the store. 
(5)	Use materials and colors that are compatible with the building and the streetscape. The simple signs that were originally used on these buildings serve as the best example for new signs. Individual letters made of wood, metal or some types of plastic that can be mounted directly on the frieze are always appropriate. The number of colors used should be limited. Contrasting the lettering with its background is more important for legibility than using bright colors. 
(6)	Use lighting judiciously. While flashing signs or moving signs should be avoided, lighted signs do identify businesses at night and can encourage evening window-shopping. 
(7)	Preserve original and historic signs. Many older buildings display the names of their original owners on the upper part of the building or above doorways at the street level. These should be preserved as part of the neighborhood's history and character.

The office or department from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board of adjustment all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
B.	Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the building inspector shall certify to the board of adjustment that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril, to life or property, in which case proceeding shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of adjustment or by a court of equity, after notice of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
C.	Notice of hearing on appeal. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and shall mail notice of such hearing to the petitioner and to the owners of property lying within 200 feet of any point of the lot or portion thereof on which a variation is desired, and to all other persons deemed by the board to be affected thereby, such owners and persons being determined according to the current tax rolls of the City of Gilmer. Depositing of such written notice in the mail shall be deemed sufficient compliance therewith. 
D.	Decision by board. The board shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination appealed from and shall make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises, and to that end, shall have all powers of the officer or department from whom the appeal is taken.

1.	Permit the erection and use of buildings.
2.	To permit a public utility or public service use or structure in any district, or a public utility or public service building of a ground area and of a height at variance with those provided for in the district in which such public utility or public service building is permitted to be located, when found reasonably necessary for the public health, convenience, safety, or general welfare. 
3.	To permit a transitional use between a business or industrial and residential district where the side of a lot in a single family or multiple family district abuts upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes as follows: 
a.	On a lot in a single-family district which sides upon a lot zoned for business or industrial purposes, the board may permit a two-family dwelling on a lot with an area of not less than 6,000 square feet. 
b.	Provided, however, that in no case shall any transitional use have a width of more than 100 feet. 
4.	To grant a permit for the extension of a use, height, or area regulation into an adjoining district, where the boundary line of the district divides a lot in a single ownership on the effective date of this ordinance. 
5.	Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make necessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience. 
6.	Permit land within 300 feet of a multifamily dwelling to be improved for the parking spaces required in connection with a multifamily dwelling, but only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used for such purpose during the existence of the multifamily dwelling. 
7.	To determine whether an industry should be permitted within district L-I, because of the methods by which it would be operated and because of its effect upon uses within surrounding zoning districts. 
8.	To determine in cases of uncertainty the classification of any use not specifically named in this ordinance. 
9.	All applications for special exceptions shall be in writing by the owner and filed with the city. Hearing shall be set not less than 15 days after filing and notice shall be given to all property owners within 200 feet of the property on which the exception is requested stating the name of the person seeking the exception, the property involved, when the application will be heard, and advising that those receiving notice may contest the application. 
D.	Variances. The board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done, owing to and including the following special conditions: 
1.	Permit a variance in the yard requirements of any district where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of these provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical or other conditions, provided such variance will not seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare. 
2.	Authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of this ordinance relating to the use, construction, or alterations of buildings or structures or the use of land will impose upon him unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship, such variances from the strict application of the terms of this ordinance as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent, but only when the board is satisfied that a granting of such variation will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variance from the community plan as established by this ordinance, and at the same time, the surrounding property will be properly protected. 
3.	Application for variance shall be in writing on a form provided by the city and it will be filed with the city and a fee of $25.00 paid by [the] applicant. Hearing shall be given to all property owners within 200 feet of the property on which the variance is sought, stating the name of the person seeking the variance, when the application will be heard and advising those receiving a notice that they may contest the application. 
E.	Changes. The board shall have no authority to change any provisions of this ordinance, and its jurisdiction is limited to hardship and borderline cases which may arise from time to time.

Section 19-1. - Purpose. 
The AR agricultural/residential district is intended to retain the open character of the land. This district is primarily designed for those areas on the periphery and within the city which have soils most suitable for agricultural production. Agricultural activities are frequently associated with noise, odors, dust, aerial chemical spraying, and other activities generally incompatible with urban life. However, agriculture forms a vital segment of both the Texas and local economy. Therefore, it is the purpose of the AR district to provide areas of low-density development to accommodate land uses within a district which will have the least negative impacts on agriculture. Developmental standards within the AR district are designed to provide for a high quality of life while effectively reducing the need for extensive urban infrastructure and associated public facilities. The regulatory provisions of this district are aimed at achieving the goals, objectives and policies associated with the city's comprehensive planning program.
