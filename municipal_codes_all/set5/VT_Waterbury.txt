Section 300 Zoning Permits
(a) Except as provided in Section 400 of this bylaw, no land development, including land subdivision,
building construction or reconstruction, and change of use (see definitions), may commence unless a
zoning permit has been duly issued by the Zoning Administrator in accordance with this bylaw and 24

of the property, if available. The applicant shall also state the existing or intended use of the land
development and supply such other information as may be required by the Zoning Administrator to
determine and provide for the enforcement of this bylaw.
(d) The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a zoning permit unless an application, fee, sketch plan, and
any other approvals required by this bylaw have been properly submitted.
(e) The Zoning Administrator shall, within 30 days of submission of a complete application, either issue
or deny a zoning permit, or refer the application to the Development Review Board,. If the Zoning
Administrator fails to act within this period, a permit shall be deemed issued on the 31st day. If the
application is denied, the Zoning Administrator shall so notify the applicant in writing, by certified mail,
stating the reasons therefore. If the zoning permit is issued, all the activities authorized by its issuance
shall be completed within 2 years from the time at which all required site related construction permits
have been issued, or the zoning permit shall become null and void and reapplication to complete any 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 4
activities shall be required. On phased projects, the time limit may be extended for up to 4 years as part
of the site plan review process. Permits issued for land development in a flood hazard area shall contain a
notation that such land development is located in a regulated flood hazard area.
(f) Each zoning permit shall contain a statement of the period of time within which an appeal may be

Administrator shall:
 (1) Deliver a copy of the permit to the listers of the municipality;

 (2) Post a copy of the permit in at least one public place in the municipality until the expiration of
fifteen (15) days from the date of issuance of the permit. The applicant shall post a notice of the permit,
on a form prescribed by the municipality, within view of the public right-of-way most nearly adjacent to
the subject property until the time for a 15-day appeal has passed.
 (3) For land development in a flood hazard area, file a copy of the permit issued with the Secretary of
the Agency of Environmental Conservation and the Regional Planning Commission within ten (10) days
of issuance; and
 (4) File a copy of the permit in the Municipal Clerk's Office of the appropriate municipality.
(g) No zoning permit shall take effect until the time for an appeal (15 days from date of issuance) to the
Development Review Board has passed or, if a notice of appeal is properly filed, such permit shall not take
effect until final adjudication of the appeal.
(h) No zoning permit shall take effect and the corresponding land development may not commence until all
required local, state, and federal permits have been issued.

recorded within 180 days of the issuance of the zoning permit for the land subdivision.
(j) As specified in 24 V.S.A §4442(a), if a public notice for a first public hearing is issued under this
chapter by the local legislative body with respect to the adoption or amendment of a bylaw, or an
amendment to an ordinance adopted under prior enabling laws, the Zoning Administrator, for a period of
150 days following that notice, shall review any new application filed after the date of the notice under
the proposed bylaw or amendment and applicable existing bylaws and ordinances. If the new bylaw or
amendment has not been adopted by the conclusion of the 150-day period or if the proposed bylaw or
amendment is rejected, the permit shall be reviewed under existing bylaws and ordinances. An
application that has been denied under a proposed bylaw or amendment that has been rejected or that has
not been adopted within the 150-day period shall be reviewed again, at no cost, under the existing bylaws
and ordinances, upon request of the applicant. Any determination by the Zoning Administrator under this
section shall be subject to appeal as provided in Section 307 of this bylaw.
Section 301 Site Plan Review and Approval
(a) Any use shall be subject to site plan approval by the Development Review Board before a zoning
permit may be issued, with the exception of the following:
 (1) One- or two-family dwellings, or a residential accessory structure.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 5
 (2) Home occupations, as described in Section 407.
 (3) A project that does not involve any intensification, expansion, or change of use and does not require
any parking-lot or driveway construction, expansion, or relocation.
 (4) Any application solely to erect or replace a sign.
 (5) Any other project that the Development Review Board deems to be minor in nature and would not
cause a substantial increase in traffic or otherwise adversely affect the purposes of this section.
(b) Before an application for site plan review is considered complete, the applicant shall file a site plan,
clearly drawn to the largest practical scale, showing the following:
 (1) Location and dimensions of lot lines, names of adjacent landowners, all easements, utilities, and
existing and proposed structures.
(2) All access to public streets or roads, parking and service areas, pedestrian walkways, curbs and
stormwater drainage.
(3) Pedestrian and vehicular circulation, including parking lot layout, entrances to structures, signs, and
lighting.
(4) Building elevations and footprints.
(5) Detailed site grading and landscaping, indicating existing and proposed trees, shrubs, and ground
cover.
(6) The Development Review Board may request additional information it deems necessary and may
visit the site to gather information.
In the Route 100 District, for properties totaling five acres or more, the additional information listed in
Section 704(a)(3) is required as part of a complete application. If an application for site plan review is
incomplete or contains insufficient information based on the requirements for completeness listed above, the
Development Review Board may disapprove the site plan.
(c) Any applicant for site plan approval must notify adjacent land owners by certified mail of the nature of
the application and the upcoming Development Review Board review at least ten days prior to such
review. The applicant must submit copies of certified-mail receipts indicating that all adjacent landowners
have received notice, and a copy of the notice sent.
(d) The applicant for any site plan shall post a notice of permit application on a form prescribed by the
municipality within view from the public right-of-way most nearly adjacent to the subject property until a
decision on the site plan review has been rendered by the Development Review Board. This notice shall
include the date, time, place, and purpose of the site plan review. The municipality shall provide these
notices to the applicant.
(e) The Development Review Board shall act to approve or disapprove any site plan within 45 days after the
date the public hearing is closed. Failure to so act within such period shall be deemed approval of the site
plan.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 6
(f) The Development Review Board will take into consideration the following objectives prior to approval
or denial:
 (1) Adequacy of traffic access. Considerations shall include:
 (A) Traffic flows at the intersection of driveways or access roads with public roads and at other
affected streets and intersections.
 (B) Location of driveway entrances and exits so as to have sufficient sight distances.
 (C) The need for turning lanes, traffic-control devices, or special provisions for emergency vehicles.
 (D) Pedestrian safety and convenience.
 (2) Adequacy of circulation and parking. Considerations shall include:
 (A) Assurance that the criteria of Section 414 of this bylaw are met.
 (B) The need for additional off-street spaces beyond the number required in Section 414.
 (C) The adequacy of surfacing and provisions for the runoff and discharge of stormwater.
 (D) The provision of appropriate buffer space and landscaping to insulate parking areas from
adjoining properties and public streets.
 (E) Placement of trees and shrubs around the periphery of parking lots and in the interior so as to
break up large parking areas. Large parking lots of 20 or more spaces shall include at least 1 tree for every
8 spaces.
 (F)The adequacy of parking, loading, refuse, and service areas.
 (G) Provisions for clearing snow for maintaining parking areas.
 (3) Adequacy of landscaping and screening. Considerations shall include:
 (A) Adequacy of landscaping, screening, and setbacks with regard to achieving maximum
compatibility with and protection for adjacent properties and public roads.
 (B) Preservation of attractive or functional existing vegetation.
 (C) The adequacy of landscaping materials to meet seasonal, soil, and topographical conditions.
 (D) Reduction of lighting and glare to the necessary minimum, including provision of appropriate
landscaping to reduce the impact of lighting and glare on adjacent properties.
 (E) Screening of unloading zones, trash bins, storage, and other service areas.
 (F)The need for landscaping buffers, fences, or berms to reduce noise.
(g) Any use in the Route 100 District shall be reviewed by the Development Review Board under the
standards set forth for planned unit developments in Section 705(c)-(l), and Subsections 705(m)(1)-(3) of 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 7
this bylaw, in addition to the standards set forth in Section 301. These criteria are to be used in site plan
review only and do not require that a planned unit development application be submitted.
(h) For any use in the Route 100 District, the Development Review Board may require suitable protection,
such as deed restriction, for proposed undeveloped land designated under the criteria in Subsections
705(m)(1)-(3). A minimum of 25 percent of the Route 100 road frontage shall be reserved as undeveloped
land with a minimum depth of 250' measured perpendicular to Route 100.
(i) In the Route 100 District development of one- or two-family dwellings may occur on a lot two acres or
more in size, provided that the front setback to the Route 100 right-of-way is 200'. For these residential lots
the frontage requirement is reduced to 200'. For these residential lots the Development Review Board may
waive the requirement for review under Section 705(c) through 705(m)(1)-(3). Any two-acre lot developed as
residential under this provision may not subsequently be permitted to include multiple uses within a structure,
under the provisions of Subsection 503(b), and shall not qualify as a pre-existing small lot under the
provisions of Section 402.
(j) Special considerations for uses of property bordering Route 2, Route 100, or Interstate 89:
 (1) Buildings shall be screened or located on a lot so as to take advantage of significant existing
vegetation and topographic features and to enhance the visual impact of the development from the road.
 (2) Parking and loading areas may be required to be located behind buildings or otherwise screened from
the road.
 (3) Development access roads shall be designed to limit curb cuts in the area. A development will be
permitted only one access curb cut, unless the Development Review Board finds that more than one is
required for safety or effective traffic flow. The Development Review Board may require that access to
properties be limited to secondary, frontage, or common access roads. The Development Review Board
may require designation of a portion of a lot as a right-of-way for a frontage or common access road.
Where a frontage road or common access road is planned but not yet constructed, temporary access from
the main road may be permitted.
 (4) In the Route 100 District, a continuous strip shall be maintained between the street line, which is the
edge of the right-of-way, and the balance of the lot and shall be adequately landscaped to preserve existing
vistas and minimize the visual impact of the development from the road. This strip shall extend from the
street line to either 75' from the road centerline or 25' from the street line, whichever is greater. The required
strip may not include any structure or parking area.
(k) In the Village Commercial (VCOM) and Town Commercial (TCOM) Districts (see Article V), the
front setback may be reduced, from 50 feet to a minimum of 25 feet, if the Development Review Board
determines, during site plan review, that all parking is located in the rear of a structure and adequate
landscaping exists in the front along the road.
(l) Where a land development requires both site plan, conditional use approval, and/or subdivision
approval, the Development Review Board shall make every effort to coordinate review of an application,
including the holding of joint hearings, when appropriate.
(m) If the Development Review Board determines that no conditions or safeguards it may properly impose
would ensure adequate and appropriate traffic access, circulation, parking, landscaping, and screening,
then the Development Review Board shall disapprove the site plan. 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 8
Section 302 Allowed Uses
(a) There are three types of uses described in this bylaw: permitted, conditional, and nonconforming. There
is a list of permitted and conditional uses allowed within each zoning district, as indicated in Article V,
Table 5.1. Any use not listed as either permitted or conditional for a given zoning district is prohibited in
that district. A nonconforming use is a pre-existing use that does not conform to existing zoning bylaws.
(b) Permitted uses may be approved by the Zoning Administrator, as provided in Article II, without
Development Review Board review, provided the proposed use or structure conforms with all regulations
that apply.
Section 303 Conditional Uses
(a) Uses designated as Conditional Uses for a district (Article V, Table 5.1), shall not be established,
enlarged, constructed, or altered without approval from the Development Review Board (hereafter, the
"Board") in accordance with the standards and procedures established in this bylaw and 24 V.S.A. §4414.
(b) Any applicant for conditional use approval must notify adjacent land owners by certified mail of the
nature of the application and of upcoming Development Review Board public hearing at least ten days
prior to such hearing. The applicant must submit copies of certified mail receipts indicating that all
adjacent landowners have received notice, and a copy of the notice sent.
(c) The applicant for any conditional use shall, at the time the application is submitted, post a notice on a
form prescribed by the municipality within view of the public right-of-way most nearly adjacent to the
subject property until a decision on the conditional use application has been rendered by the Development
Review Board. This notice shall include the date, time, place, and purpose of the conditional use review.
The municipality shall provide these notices to the applicant.
(d) Before the Board authorizes the issuance of a conditional use permit, the Board shall hold a public
hearing and shall give notice of the public hearing as directed by 24 V.S.A. §4464. Failure of the Board to
act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove any such requested conditional use within 45 days
after the date of closing the final public hearing shall be deemed approval.
(e) Prior to granting any approval for conditional use, the Board must find that the proposed use conforms
to the following general and specific standards:
(1) The proposed use will not have an undue adverse impact on the capacity of existing or planned
community facilities to accommodate it. The proposed use:
 (A) Will not cause the level of service on roads and highways to fall below a reasonable standard;
 (B) Will not cause an unmanageable burden on municipal water or sewer systems;
 (C) Will not lead to such additional school enrollments that existing and planned school system capacity
is exceeded; and
 (D) Will not cause an unmanageable burden on fire protection services.
 (E) The Board may seek or require advisory input from the Municipal Manager, Fire Department, Police 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 9
Department, School Board, or other municipal officials regarding relevant facilities. The Board will also
take into account sections of the Municipal Plan and of any duly adopted capital plan which specify
anticipated demand growth, service standards, and facility construction plans.
(2) The proposed use will not have an undue adverse impact on the character of the area affected as
defined by the Municipal Plan and the zoning district in which the proposed project is located.
Specifically, the proposed use:
 (A) Will not result in undue water pollution, undue adverse impacts to downstream properties, and will
not cause unreasonable soil erosion or reduction in the capacity of the land to hold water so that a
dangerous or unhealthy condition may result; in making this determination, the Board shall at least
consider the elevation, the slope of the land, and the nature of soils and subsoils and their ability to
adequately support waste disposal;
 (B) Will not result in undue noise, light, or air pollution, including offensive odors, dust, smoke, or
noxious gasses;
 (C) Will not have an undue adverse effect on the scenic or natural beauty of the area, historic sites, or
rare and irreplaceable natural areas;
 (D) Will not be otherwise inconsistent with existing uses in the immediate area; in determining the
appropriateness of the use or structure in an area, the Board shall consider the scale and design of the
proposed use or structure in relation to the scale and design of existing uses and structures in the same
district; and
 (E) Will not cause danger of fire, explosion, or electrical hazard, or in any other way jeopardize the
health and safety of the area.
(3) The proposed use will not violate any municipal bylaws and ordinances in effect.
(4) The proposed use will comply with the specific lot area, setbacks, and lot coverage requirements set
forth in this bylaw. The Board may require the proposed use to conform to more stringent lot area, setback,
and lot coverage requirements as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of the district in which
the use is located and other provisions in this bylaw.
(f) The Board may attach any reasonable conditions and safeguards it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the district in which the use is located and other provisions in this bylaw, including, but not
limited to, the following conditions:
(1) For uses that will cause the level of service on a road or street to exceed a Level of Service C, as
defined by the Vermont Agency of Transportation, the Board may require modifications to the proposed
access, circulation, and parking or may require contributions, based on the project's share of the projected
volume of traffic above the Level of Service C, for making the following possible modifications:
 (A) Reduction in curb cuts, change in location or number of access points, and shared access with
adjoining property owners.
 (B) Installation of acceleration or deceleration lanes on the street or highway adjacent to any driveway,
frontage, or service road;
 (C) Improvements to access or other intersections burdened by a project.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 10
(2) With the exception of agricultural uses, the Board may require the installation of devices or methods
to prevent or control fumes, gas, dust, smoke, odor, noise, or vibration.
(g) For any proposed development in flood hazard areas, the conditional use standards established in
Section 603 shall be applied in addition to those in this section.
(h) The removal of earth or mineral products which is not incidental to a construction, landscaping, or
agricultural operation shall require a conditional use permit. In addition to finding the project meets the
other standards in this section, a removal project must meet the following conditions:
(1) The applicant shall submit a general plan of extraction and reclamation.
(2) The operator shall provide for the proper drainage of the area of the operation during and after
completion. Excavation operations shall not be conducted within 100 feet of adjoining lot lines.
Excavation operations shall not have an undue adverse impact on soil fertility, drainage, and lateral
support of adjacent land or other properties, nor shall it contribute to soil erosion by water or wind.
(3) At the conclusion of the operation, or of any substantial portion thereof, top soil shall be replaced to a
depth capable of supporting vegetation and a suitable cover crop established, except where ledge rock is
exposed.
(4) If removal or fill takes place within any stream bed or its banks, a permit shall first be obtained from
the Vermont Department of Water Resources, if required.
(5) The hours of operation, routes, and frequency of traffic generated by the operation shall be regulated to
maintain the safety and character of neighborhoods along the routes of travel.
(6) All permits granted for the removal of earth or mineral products are subject to review by the
Development Review Board every three years for continuation or termination.
(i) If the Board determines that no conditions or safeguards it may properly attach would result in
compliance with the general standards and criteria set forth above, then it shall deny the application.
Section 304 Nonconforming Uses and Noncomplying Structures
(a) A use made nonconforming or a structure made noncomplying (see definitions) by enactment of this
bylaw, or an amendment thereto, may be continued, subject to the following conditions:
(1) Under its power to grant conditional use approval and through that procedure, the Development
Review Board may allow a nonconforming use to be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that
it finds the change to be more in conformance with the district requirements and allowable uses.
(2) A nonconforming use may be extended (see definition of extension of use) within the boundary lines
of a parcel or lot existing on the date of this bylaw, or an amendment thereto, with the approval of the
Development Review Board and with the granting of all required permits. The Development Review Board
must find that a proposed nonconforming use meets the general and specific standards for conditional uses
specified in Section 303.
(3) When a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of one year, it shall not thereafter be 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 11
reestablished, and the future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this bylaw. Discontinuance
shall not be deemed to have occurred if the Board finds that the maintenance of equipment and other acts
of the owner demonstrate an intent to continually maintain the use. The Development Review Board must
find that a proposed nonconforming use meets the general and specific standards for conditional uses
specified in Section 303.
(b) Nothing in this section shall prevent the issuance of a building permit for restoration or reconstruction
within one year of a structure damaged or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe to its condition prior to
such damage or destruction.
(c) In accordance with 24 V.S.A. §4412(h), the Development Review Board, after public hearing, may
approve the repair, relocation, replacement, or enlargement of a noncomplying structure within a
designated flood hazard area, subject to compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations, and
provided that the following criteria are met:
(1) The Board must find that the repair, relocation, or enlargement of the noncomplying structure is
required for continued economically feasible operation of a non-residential enterprise.
(2) The Board must find that the repair, relocation, or enlargement of the noncomplying structure will
not increase flood levels in the floodway, or threaten the health, safety, and welfare of the public or other
property owners.
(d) The permit affecting a noncomplying structure in a flood hazard area, if granted, must state that the
repaired, relocated, or enlarged noncomplying structure is located in a regulated flood hazard area, does
not conform to the bylaws pertaining thereto, and will be maintained at the risk of the owner. A copy of the
permit must be affixed to the copy of the deed of the concerned property on file in the Municipal Clerk's
Office.
Section 305 Temporary Uses and Structures
(a) Uses and temporary structures, such as commercial tents, flea markets, and auctions, which occur or are

which shall include findings of fact within 10 days of the filing of a notice of appeal, if the Board
determines that the issues raised by the appellant have been decided in an earlier appeal or are based on
substantially or materially the same facts by or on behalf of the appellant [§4470].
(d) In accordance with the 24 V.S.A. §4468, all appeal hearings shall be open to the public and the rules
of evidence applicable at these hearings shall be the same as the rules of evidence applicable in contested
cases in hearings before administrative agencies as set forth in 3 V.S.A. §810. Any interested person or

Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 13
(h) As specified in 24 V.S.A. §4470, the Development Review Board may reject an appeal without hearing
and render a decision, which shall include findings of fact and conclusions, within ten (10) days of the date
of filing of an appeal, provided that the Development Review Board considers the issues raised by the
appellant to have been decided in an earlier appeal or involved are the same in substantially or materially
the same facts by or on behalf of that appellant. The decision shall be rendered, on notice given, as in the
case of a decision under 24 V.S.A. §4464(b)(3), and shall constitute a decision of the Development Review
Board for the purpose of 24 V.S.A. §4471.
(i) An interested party who has participated in a proceeding authorized under these bylaws may appeal a
decision of the Development Review Boardwithin thirty (30) days of such decision to the Environmental

Section 308 Variances
(a) As specified in 24 V.S.A. §4469, the Development Review Board may grant variances for a structure
that is not primarily a renewable energy resource structure on appeal. Variances may be granted for a
zoning district's dimensional requirements, but variances may not be granted from permitted or conditional
uses, from minimum lot areas requirements, or from sign requirements. As required in 24 V.S.A. §§4469, a
variance will be granted only if all the following facts are found and the finding is stated in the Board's
decision:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not to the circumstances or
conditions generally created by this bylaw in the district in which the property is located;
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can
be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this bylaw and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property;
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public welfare;
and
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will
represent the least deviation possible from this bylaw and from the Municipal Plan.
(b) For variances sought for development in areas defined in Section 602 of Article VI, the Development
Review Board must review the development under the requirements of Article VI, Flood Hazard Area
Regulations and Overlay District.
(c) In granting a variance, the Board may attach such conditions to the variance as it may consider
necessary and appropriate under the circumstances to implement the purpose of 24 V.S.A. Ch. 117 and this
bylaw.
(d) Variances shall not be granted for the location, height, and other characteristics of signs.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 14
Section 309 Waivers
(a) Notwithstanding the minimum setback standards set forth in Table 5.2, in accordance with 24 V.S.A.
§ 4414(8), the Development Review Board may grant a waiver of building setbacks as a conditional use
reviewed in accordance with Section 303; provided, however, that the encroachment does not have an
undue adverse impact on the use and enjoyment of adjoining properties from which the setback waiver is
sought.
(b) Any applicant for a setback waiver pursuant to Section 309(a) must notify adjacent land owners by
certified mail of the nature of the application and of upcoming Development Review Board public hearing
at least ten days prior to such hearing. The applicant must submit copies of certified mail receipts
indicating that all adjacent landowners have received notice, and a copy of the notice sent.
Section 310 Enforcement
(a) As provided for in 24 V.S.A. §4451, any person who violates this bylaw shall be fined not more than
fifty dollars for each offense. No action may be brought under this section unless the alleged offender has
had at least seven days' warning notice by certified mail. An action may be brought without the seven-day
notice and opportunity to cure if the alleged offender repeats the violation of this bylaw after the seven-day
notice period and within the next succeeding twelve months. The seven-day warning notice shall state that
a violation exists, that the alleged offender has an opportunity to cure the violation within the seven days
and that the alleged offender will not be entitled to an additional warning notice for a violation occurring
after the seven days. In default of payment of the fine, such person, the members of any partnership, or the
principal officers of such corporation shall each pay double the amount of such fine. Each day that a
violation is continued shall constitute a separate offense. All fines collected for the violation of this bylaw
shall be paid over to the municipality whose bylaw has been violated.
(b) As specified in 24 V.S.A. §4452, if any street, building, structure, or land is or is proposed to be
erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained, or used in violation of this bylaw, the
Zoning Administrator shall institute in the name of the municipality any appropriate action, injunction, or
other proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate such construction or use, or to prevent, in or about
such premises, any act, conduct, business, or use constituting a violation.
ARTICLE IV GENERAL REGULATIONS
Section 400 Compliance With This Bylaw
(a) No land development may commence except in conformance with the regulations herein specified for
the district in which it is located.
(b) No lot or required yard shall be so reduced in area, setbacks, frontage, coverage, or other requirements

shall not apply when part of a lot is taken for a public purpose.
(c) In the case of lots lying in more than one district, the following shall apply:
(1) The less restrictive use may extend into the more restrictive portion to a maximum of 30 feet.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 15
(2) If the lot size requirement has been met in any district, any amount of additional acreage may be
added to the lot from the adjacent district, but any development in the adjacent district shall meet the
dimensional requirements of that district except as provided for in subsection 400(c)(3).
(3) The dimensional requirements of any a less restrictive district may extend into and be applied in any
adjacent district up to a maximum of 50 feet.
(d) Nothing contained in this bylaw shall require any change in the plans, construction, or designated use
of a building complying with local laws in force prior to this bylaw revision, if a prior permit shall have
been duly issued, and the entire building shall have been completed in accordance with such plans within
one year from the effective date of this bylaw revision, or such time period for completion as is stipulated
in the permit.
(e) Compliance with this bylaw shall not waive the obligation of the applicant to comply with any other
state or local regulations governing the development or use of the property.

1259(f) & 6001(22). For purposes of this section, “farm structure” means a building, enclosure, or fence
for housing livestock, raising horticultural or agronomic plants, or carrying out other practices associated
with accepted agricultural or farming practices, including a silo, but excludes a dwelling for human
habitation. A person shall notify a municipality of the intent to build a farm structure and shall abide by
setbacks approved by the secretary of agriculture, food, and markets. Agricultural activity is farming in
accordance with the state Accepted Agricultural Practices and farming as defined in 10 V.S.A. Section 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 16

more than ten (10) percent of the floor area of such building and are not used for any human occupancy.
(b) Notwithstanding provisions for front yards elsewhere in these bylaws, on streets with less than 50-foot
right-of-way, the front yard setback shall be measured from the centerline of the existing roadway and 25
feet shall be added to the front yard setback requirement.
(c) In the case of a corner lot, the required front yard dimension shall apply on all streets.
(d) Any permanent right-of-way or easement on a lot of one acre or less shall not be included when

requirements, if such lot is not less than one-eighth (1/8) acre in area with a minimum lot width or
dimension of forty (40) feet.
(b) If a lot not conforming to the minimum lot size requirements in the district in which it is located
subsequently comes under common ownership with one or more contiguous lots, the nonconforming lot
shall be deemed merged with the contiguous lot. However, a nonconforming lot shall not be deemed
merged and may be separately conveyed if all the following apply:
(1) The lots are conveyed in their preexisting, nonconforming configuration.
(2) On the effective date of this bylaw, each lot was developed with a water supply and wastewater
disposal system.
(3) At the time of transfer, each water supply and wastewater system is functioning in an acceptable
manner.

Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 17
wastewater systems, potable water systems, or both, in case there is a failed system or failed supply as
defined in 10 V.S.A. Ch. 64.
Section 403 More than One Building or Use on a Lot
More than one principal use or structure on the same lot may be permitted provided that each of the
principal uses or structures meets all of the dimensional and other requirements of this bylaw, including
minimum lot size and setbacks, as if it were on a separate lot. Accessory dwelling units, as defined in
Article X of this bylaw, are not considered principal uses or structures under this bylaw.
Section 404 Travel Trailer and Recreation Vehicle Storage
Travel trailers or recreational vehicles may be stored on the premises of the owner. They may not be used
for dwelling purposes for more than one month in any year without a zoning permit.

children shall be considered by right to constitute a permitted single-unit residential use of property.
Section 407 Home Occupations
(a) No provision of this bylaw shall prevent a person from using a minor portion of the dwelling in which
he or she resides and/or an accessory building on the same lot for a home occupation. A person wishing to
establish a home occupation must first obtain a permit from the Zoning Administrator. Site plan review is
not required for home occupations.
(b) Applications for home occupations must meet the following criteria in order to receive zoning permit
approval. For those applications that do not clearly meet these criteria, the Zoning Administrator shall refer
to the Development Review Board for a ruling on whether an application qualifies as a home occupation:
(1) The occupation must be customary in residential areas, subordinate to residential purposes, and shall
not have an undue adverse impact on the character of the neighborhood as defined by the Municipal Plan
and the zoning district in which the proposed home occupation is located.
(2) Regardless of whether the home occupation is in the dwelling or an accessory building, the total area
devoted to the home occupation shall be less than 35 percent of the area of the dwelling living space,
excluding garages and other accessory structures or space.

(8) Parking shall be provided off street for household members, employees, and those with whom business
is transacted, in accordance with Section 414.
(c) A zoning permit issued for a home occupation shall not follow the land. Therefore, the permit expires

wishes to continue a particular home occupation, he or she shall apply to the Zoning Administrator for a
permit.
Section 408 Fences
(a) In all districts, fences are restricted to a height of six (6) feet, unless otherwise permitted in site plan
approval.
Section 409 Public Utility Substations
Public utility substations and similar utility structures require a zoning permit and site plan review, must
conform with the district regulations for front, side, and rear yards, and may be required by the
Development Review Board to be fenced. If the public utility substation project is being reviewed by the
Vermont Public Service Board under 30 V.S.A. §248, the project does not require a Zoning Permit under
Section 400(f)(8).
Section 410 Storage of Flammable Commodities
The storage of any highly flammable commodities in containers above or below ground with unit capacity
greater than one thousand (1,000) gallons shall be installed and constructed in accordance to all
appropriate state and federal regulations. All zoning applications that involve the storage of these
flammable commodities must obtain all applicable state and federal permits before a zoning permit can be
issued. In particular, the storage of propane gas in quantities exceeding one thousand (1,000) gallons shall
be done according to the 1987 BOCA Fire Prevention Code and the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) Article 58 and all other applicable regulations. Fuel oil storage containers shall be constructed and
installed according to the NFPA Flammable and Combustible Liquid Codes Handbook, Articles 30 and 31,
and all other applicable regulations. 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 19
Section 411 Demolition, Abandonment of Structure
(a) The demolition of all or part of any nonresidential and nonagricultural building or accessory building
shall require the issuance of a zoning permit and site plan review by the Development Review Board, since
it constitutes a change of use.
(b) In Waterbury Village, within six months after a permanent or temporary building or structure has been
destroyed or demolished, all evidence of that structure shall be removed from the site, and excavation thus
remaining shall be covered over or filled to the normal grade with suitable fill. An abandoned structure

around and away from proposed structures.
(10) The placement of fill in Special Flood Hazard Areas, excluding the placement of material in
basements for structures with a footprint of 5,000 sq. ft. or less, shall require certification from a
professional engineer that the amount and location of the fill will not elevate the Base Flood Elevation by
any amount and may require compensatory storage or alternate flood attenuation. NOTE: The placement
of fill in Floodways is prohibited.
(11) Compensatory storage or alternate flood attenuation methods utilized for development,
including the placement of structures and/or fill, shall:
(A) Not increase the Base Flood Elevation or decrease Special Flood Hazard Area storage
capacity. Development that displaces floodwater storage in the Special Flood Hazard Area must
provide compensatory storage to offset the impacts of the proposal, when the development will
cause an increase or will contribute incrementally to an increase in the horizontal extent and
level of flood waters during peak flows up to and including the base flood discharge. Volumetric
analyses and supporting data must be provided by the applicant and certified by a registered
professional engineer.

computer model utilized to develop the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the results tabulated in
the related Flood Insurance Study.
E) Exceptions. The compensatory storage or alternate flood attenuation requirements may be
waived for:
(i) Additions and accessory structures that are less than or equal to 200 sq. ft. in
footprint provided that the designs will have no more than a minimal effect on
floodwater storage and will not divert floodwaters onto adjacent property.
(ii) Designs that do not effect on floodwater storage include open foundation
designs, and utility work that is largely below grade.
(iii) Minor above ground improvements such as fences or poles that minimally
displace or divert floodwaters.
(iv) Replacement structures provided that there is no increase in the structure’s
footprint.
(v) Replacement structures relocated to a less hazardous location within the Special
Flood Hazard Area provided that there is no increase in the structure’s footprint
(12) The flood carrying and sediment transport capacity within the altered or relocated portion of
any watercourse shall be maintained, and any alteration or relocation shall not result in any decrease of
stream stability.
(13) Bridge and culverts, which by their nature must be placed in or over the stream, must obtain a
stream alteration permit from the Agency of Natural Resources, if required.
(b) Floodways
(1) Encroachment or development above grade and less than one foot above the base flood elevation
are prohibited unless hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice, by a registered professional engineer certifying that the proposed development
will:
(A) Not result in any increase in flood levels (0.00 feet) during the occurrence of the base flood;
and
(B) Not increase any risk to surrounding properties, facilities, or structures from erosion or
flooding.
(2) Public utilities may be placed underground, and the analyses may be waived, where a registered

structure; and
(2) The substantial improvement shall not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic
structure.
(c) Any variance granted for development in Special Flood Hazard Areas shall not increase Base Flood
Elevation other than as allowed by this Article. Furthermore, the applicant shall be notified in writing 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 35
over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property and may result in increased flood insurance
premiums up to amounts as high as $25 for every $100 of insurance coverage. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions.
Section 611 Warning of Disclaimer of Liability
This Article does not imply that land outside of the Areas of Special Flood Hazard or land use permitted
within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Article shall not create liability on
the part of the Town of Waterbury or any Town official or employee thereof for any flood damages that

or occupancy of any land or structure, or part thereof, created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure within Special Flood Hazard Areas until a certificate of
completion is issued therefore by the Zoning Administrator stating that the proposed use of the structure
or land conforms to the requirements of this Article. A certificate of completion is not required for
structures that were built in compliance with the regulations at the time of construction and have not been
improved since the adoption of this regulation. Within 14 days of the receipt of the application for a
certificate of completion, the Zoning Administrator shall inspect the premises to ensure that all work has
been completed in conformance with the zoning permit and associated municipal approvals. If the Zoning
Administrator fails to grant or deny the certificate of completion within 14 days of the submission of the
application, the certificate shall be deemed issued on the 15th day. If a certificate of completion cannot be
issued, notice will be sent to the owner and copied to the lender.
Section 615 Enforcement and Penalties
(a) It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to enforce the provisions of this Article. Whenever
any development occurs contrary to this Article, the Zoning Administrator, in his discretion, shall

Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 36
violation by certified mail. A copy of the notice of violation will be mailed to the State NFIP
Coordinator. An action may be brought without the seven-day notice and opportunity to cure if the
alleged offender repeats the violation after the seven-day notice period and within the next succeeding
twelve months. The seven-day warning notice shall state that a violation exists, that the alleged offender
has an opportunity to cure the violation within the seven days, and that the alleged offender will not be
entitled to an additional warning notice for a violation occurring after the seven days.
(c) If the structure is still noncompliant after the seven-day opportunity to cure has passed, the Zoning
Administrator shall submit a declaration to the Administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program
requesting a denial of flood insurance. Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, authorizes FEMA to deny flood insurance to a property declared by a community to be in
violation of their flood hazard area regulations. The declaration shall consist of: (a) the name of the
property owner and address or legal description of the property sufficient to confirm its identity or
location, (b) a clear and unequivocal declaration that the property is in violation of a cited state or local
law, regulation, or ordinance, (c) a clear statement that the public body making the declaration has
authority to do so and a citation to that authority, (d) evidence that the property owner has been provided
notice of the violation and the prospective denial of insurance, and (e) a clear statement that the
declaration is being submitted pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended.
(d) Violations of the Accepted Agricultural Practices shall be immediately reported to the Secretary of
Agriculture for enforcement under 6 V.S.A. Chapter 215 §4812.
ARTICLE VII PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
Section 700 General Purpose
(a) The purpose of planned unit development (PUD) is to enable and encourage flexibility of design and
development of land in such a manner as to promote the most appropriate and efficient use of land, to
facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities, and to preserve the natural and
scenic qualities of open lands in conformance with the Municipal Plan and this bylaw. PUDs may include
any mix of residential and nonresidential uses that are allowed in a district.
(b) Accordingly, the Development Review Board is hereby authorized to modify the area and dimensional
requirements of this bylaw simultaneously with the approval of the subdivision plat for a PUD. However,
such modifications shall be limited as provided in 24 V.S.A. §4417 and as set forth below.
Section 701 Applicability
(a) Only land development involving a parcel three or more acres in size may qualify for consideration as a
PUD. Any residential project involving fewer than three dwelling units shall not qualify. The application
of planned unit development bylaws to a proposed development may involve single or multiple properties
and one owner or multiple owners.
(b) PUDs are permitted in any district, but all of the separate uses included for a PUD must be permitted in
the district for which the PUD is proposed or have received conditional approval, if allowed.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 37
Section 702 Permitted Densities
(a) Pursuant to the provisions in 24 V.S.A. §4417, density limitations in a PUD are established as follows:
 (1) The total area of undeveloped land shall be designated to be at least 50 percent of total project land.
 (2) For PUDs that are entirely residential, the maximum number of dwelling units allowed is as follows:
(A) For single-family dwellings, divide the total acreage of the parcel, or portion thereof, by the
minimum lot size applicable in the district.
(B) For duplexes, divide the total acreage, or portion thereof, by the minimum lot size applicable in
the district, then multiply by two.
(C) For multi-family, multiply the total acreage, or portion thereof, by the allowed density in
dwelling units per acre for the applicable district identified in Section 504, Table 5.3.
(D) A density bonus may be granted as outlined in this Section.
 (3) For PUDs that are entirely nonresidential, the area occupied by structures shall not exceed the
maximum coverage for the acreage dedicated to commercial use, including deeded undeveloped land, in
the applicable zoning district.
 (4) For PUDs that include both residential and nonresidential uses, maximum densities are determined as
follows:
(A) For the residential uses of the site, apply the density calculation in Section 702(a)(2) above to
the residential portion of the site acreage, including the residential portion of the undeveloped land. A
density bonus may be granted as outlined in this Section.
(B) For the nonresidential uses of the site, apply the density calculation in Section 702(a)(3) above to
the nonresidential portion of the site acreage, including the nonresidential portion of the undeveloped land.
(C) For multi-use buildings that include both residential and commercial uses in the same structure,
the allowed density for residential dwelling units on the acreage dedicated to the multi-use is calculated as
in Section 702(a)(2); the residential use can occupy the same building footprint or maximum coverage as
the nonresidential use.
(b) Along the outside boundary of the PUD project, setbacks shall be twice the dimensions established for
the district in which the project, or applicable portion of the project, is located.
The Development Review Board may, in accordance with the review process contained in Section 704(g),
reduce this double setback for a portion of the entire outside boundary, provided the following criteria are
met: 1) The setback is not less than the required setback for the district in which the affected portion of the
project is located; 2) the applicant shall demonstrate that a lot configuration which utilizes the double
setback exclusively does not yield practical building sites and does not meet the general purpose of these
PUD bylaws; and 3) adequate screening and landscaping exist or are proposed as required in Sections
301(f)(3) and 705(k). Other than this setback, no other setbacks apply to PUDs.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 38

 (12) Construction sequence and time schedule for completion of each phase of the entire project.
 (13) Any additional information requested by the Development Review Board.
(d) Plans shall be drawn at a minimum at the scale of one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet. The permit
application shall be signed under the penalties of perjury.
Section 903 Conditional Use Review Criteria
(a) No telecommunications facility shall be erected, constructed, or installed without first obtaining a
conditional use permit from the Development Review Board. A conditional use permit is required for
new tower construction (or major modification of an existing tower) and for new telecommunications
facilities (or major modification of existing facilities) to be mounted on a tower or structure.
(b) In acting on the conditional use permit application, the Development Review Board shall proceed in
accordance with Section 303 of the bylaw of the Town and Village of Waterbury. Prior to granting such
approval, the Board shall make affirmative findings for each of the criteria given in Section 303 of this
bylaw.
Section 904 Project Requirements [Tower and Antenna Design Requirements]
(a) In addition to the site plan review criteria listed in Section 301, the Development Review Board shall
consider the following additional review criteria:
 (1) Proposed facilities shall not unreasonably interfere with the view from any public park, natural
scenic vista, historic building or district, or major view corridor. Height and mass of facilities shall not
exceed that which is essential for their intended use and public safety.
 (2) Bulk, Height, Glare. All telecommunications facilities, including towers, antennas and any
necessary support structures shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize the visual impact of
height, mass, and guy wire supports. Materials utilized for the exterior of any structure shall be of a type,
color, and style so as to minimize glare and to blend into the surrounding environment, except in cases in
which the Federal Aviation Authority, state or federal authorities have dictated color.
 (3) Height Limitations. In order to protect public safety and to preserve the scenic character and
appearance of the area, the height limit for towers, antennas and tower-related fixtures in all districts
shall not exceed twenty (20) feet above the average height of the tree line within one hundred (100) feet
of the base of the tower. Notwithstanding the above, additional height may be approved upon a finding
by the Development Review Board that the additional height is necessary in order to provide adequate 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 52
coverage, or to accomplish collocation as outlined in Section 1.7, and that the additional height will not
have an undue visual impact on the scenic character or appearance of the area.
 (4) Setbacks and Fall Zones. All wireless communications facilities shall comply with the setback
provisions of the zoning district in which the facility is located. There shall be no variances for fall zones
except, if an existing structure such as a barn silo, church steeple, or utility pole is proposed as a
mounting for a telecommunications tower, a fall zone shall not be required.
 (5) Landscaping and Screening. Ground-mounted equipment or antennas as well as buildings and
structures accessory to a tower shall be screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a design
of non-vegetative screening better complements the character of the surrounding neighborhood. A
planted or vegetative screen shall be a minimum of ten feet in depth with a minimum height of six (6)
feet and shall have the potential to grow to a height of at least fifteen (15) feet at maturity. Existing onsite vegetation outside the immediate site for the wireless facility shall be preserved or improved.
Disturbance to existing topography shall be minimized unless the disturbance is demonstrated to result in
less visual impact on the facility from surrounding properties and other vantage points.
 (6) Lighting. Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and shall not display lights unless
such lighting is specifically required by the FAA or other federal or state authority for a particular tower
because of its height. Any lighting required solely as a result of height may be subject to review by the
Town. Heights may be reduced to eliminate the need for lighting or another location selected. All tower
lighting shall be shielded to minimize glare and impact on neighboring properties.
 (7) Fencing and Signage. The area around the tower and communications equipment shall be
completely fenced for security to a height of six (6) feet and gated. The use of razor wire is not permitted.
A sign no greater than two (2) square feet stating the name of the facility’s owner and a 24-hour
emergency telephone number shall be posted adjacent to the entry gate. In addition, “No Trespassing” or
other warning signs and the federal tower registration plate, where applicable, may be posted on the
fence or as required to meet federal requirements. No commercial signs or lettering shall be placed on a
tower.
 (8) Noise. Noise at the site perimeter from the operation of any machinery or equipment shall be
minimized.
 (9) Protection of Scenic Ridges and Hillsides. Towers shall, when possible, be sited off ridge lines
and where their visual impact is least detrimental to scenic areas. In determining whether the proposed
tower will have an undue adverse visual impact on the scenic beauty of a ridge of hillside, the
Development Review Board shall consider, among other things, the following:
 (A) The period of time during which the proposed tower will be viewed by the traveling public on a
public highway, public trail, or public body of water;
 (B) The frequency of the view of the proposed tower by the traveling public;
 (C) The degree to which the view of the tower is screened by existing vegetation, the topography of
the land, and existing structures;
 (D) Background features in the line of sight to the proposed tower that obscure the facility or make it
more conspicuous;
 (E) The distance of the tower from the viewing vantage point and the proportion of the facility that is
visible above the skyline;
 (F) The number of travelers or vehicles traveling on a public highway, public trail, or public body of
water at or near the critical vantage point; and
 (G) The sensitivity or unique value of the particular view affected by the proposed tower.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 53
To assist the Development Review Board in its review, the Development Review Board may require the
applicant to fly or raise a three-foot diameter balloon at the maximum height of the proposed facility at a
location within fifty (50) horizontal feet of the center of the proposed facility. The applicant shall provide
photographs of the balloon test taken from at least four vantage points previously designated by the
Development Review Board.
The Development Review Board may, at its sole discretion, waive any of the requirements of this
subsection [(905(a)(9)] for the purpose of approving the development of a wireless communications
facility utilizing innovative siting techniques that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or
towers.
 (10) Access Roads and Above-Ground Utilities. Where new telecommunications facilities require
construction of or improvement to access roads, to the extent practicable, roads shall follow the contours
of the land. Access roads, when consistent with the purposes of this section and economically feasible,
shall be constructed or improved within existing forest or forest fringe areas and not in open fields.
Utility or service lines shall be designed and located so as to minimize or prevent disruption to the scenic
character or beauty of the area.
Section 905 Collocation Requirements
(a) An application for a new (non-collocated) telecommunications tower shall not be approved unless the
Development Review Board finds that the telecommunications facilities planned for the proposed tower
cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or structure due to one of the following
reasons:
 (1) The proposed antennas and equipment would exceed the structural or spatial capacity of the
existing or approved tower or facility, as documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the
state of Vermont. Additionally, the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced
to accommodate planned or equivalent equipment, at a reasonable cost, to provide coverage and capacity
comparable to that of the proposed facility.
 (2) The proposed antennas and equipment would cause interference materially impacting the
usefulness of other existing or permitted equipment at the existing or approved tower or facility as
documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the state of Vermont and such interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
 (3) The proposed antennas and equipment, alone or together with existing facilities, equipment or
antennas, would create RFI in violation of federal standards or requirements.
 (4) The proposed antennas and equipment, either alone or together with existing facilities,
equipment or antennas, would create RFR in violation of federal standards or requirements.
 (5) Existing or approved towers and structures cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a
height necessary to function reasonably or are too far from the area of needed coverage to function
reasonably as documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the state of Vermont.
 (6) Aesthetic considerations make it unreasonable to locate the planned telecommunications
equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 54
 (7) There is no existing or approved tower in the area in which coverage is sought.
 (8) Other unforeseen specific reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned
telecommunications equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.
(b) Towers must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept
antennas mounted at varying heights when overall permitted height allows. Towers shall be designed
structurally, electrically and in all respects to accommodate both the applicant’s antennas and additional
antennas when overall permitted height allows.
Section 906 Amendments to Existing Telecommunications Facility Permit
(a) An alteration or addition to a previously approved telecommunications facility shall require a permit
amendment when any of the following are proposed:
 (1) A change in the number of buildings or facilities permitted on the site;
 (2) Changes in technology used by the telecommunications facility; or
 (3) An addition or change of any equipment or an increase in the height of the tower, including
profile of additional antennas, not specified in the original application.
Section 907 Temporary Wireless Communication Facilities
(a) Any telecommunications facility designed for temporary use is exempt from the provisions above, but
is subject to the following:
 (1) Use of a temporary facility is permitted only if the owner has received a temporary use permit
from the Town or Village of Waterbury.
 (2) Temporary telecommunications facilities are permitted for no longer than five days use during a
special event.
 (3) The maximum height of a temporary facility is fifty (50) feet from grade.
 (4) Temporary facilities must comply with all applicable portions of these regulations.
Section 908 Interference With Public Safety Telecommunications
No new telecommunications facility shall be placed or constructed in such a way as to interfere with
public safety telecommunications. All applications for new telecommunications facilities shall be
accompanied by an intermodulation study that predicts no likely interference problems and certification
that the study has been provided to the appropriate public safety agencies. Before testing or operating
new service or changes in existing service, telecommunications providers shall notify the municipality at
least ten calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the municipality to monitor interference
levels during that testing process.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 55
Section 909 Continuing Obligations
Upon receiving a permit, the permittee shall annually, by January 15, document that the facility is in
compliance with all FCC standards. The permittee shall provide a list of the most recent RFR readings at
the site, their distances from the tower/transmitter, dates of the readings and the name of the person or
company who took the readings.
Section 910 Removal of Abandoned Antennas and Towers
(a) The owner of a facility/tower shall annually, by January 15, file a declaration with the Zoning
Administrator certifying the continuing safe operation of every facility/tower installed subject to these
regulations. Failure to file a declaration shall mean that the facility/tower is no longer in use and will be
considered abandoned. An owner who has failed to file an annual declaration with the Zoning
Administrator by January 15 may, by February 15, file a declaration of use or intended use and may
request the authorization to continue use of the facility/tower.
(b) At the time of removal, the facility site shall be remediated such that all telecommunications facility
improvements that have ceased to be utilized are removed. If all facilities on a tower have ceased to
operate, the tower shall also be removed, and the site shall be remediated. Existing trees shall only be
removed if necessary to complete the required removal of the telecommunications tower/facility.
(c) Abandoned or unused towers shall be removed as follows:
 (1) The owner shall remove abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities within 180 days of
cessation of operations at the site unless the Development Review Board approves a time extension. In
the event the tower is not removed within 180 days of the cessation of operations at a site, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a notice of abandonment to the last known owner/operator of the facility. If the
tower is not removed within 90 days of the issuance of such notice, the Town or Village may remove the
tower and all associated facilities. Costs of removal shall be assessed against the property or facility
owner or both. As a condition of approval the Development Review Board may require the applicant to
provide a financial surety bond payable to the Town or Village of Waterbury (as appropriate) to cover
the costs of removal of the telecommunications facility and the remediation of the landscape, should the
facility be deemed abandoned.
 (2) Unused portions of towers shall be removed within 180 days of the time that such portion is no
longer used for antennas. The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the
issuance of a new telecommunications facility permit.
Section 911 Maintenance of Telecommunications Facilities Insurance
The telecommunications facility owner shall maintain adequate insurance on all telecommunications
facilities. All facility sites shall be properly fenced and identified by signage that indicates presence of
RFR and any other appropriate warnings required by permit conditions.
Section 912 Fees
The Select Board shall establish a schedule of fees to cover permitting and monitoring costs. Fees may
include the reasonable costs of an independent technical assessment of the application.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 56
Section 913 Enforcing Agent
The Zoning Administrator shall be the agent to enforce the provisions of this bylaw.
Section 914 Severability
If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any portion of this bylaw unconstitutional or invalid, the
remainder of this bylaw shall not be affected.
ARTICLE X RIDGELINES, HILLSIDES, STEEP SLOPES
Section 1000 Purpose
(a) The purpose of the Ridgeline/Hillside/Steep Slope (RHS) Overlay District is to regulate development
in higher elevation areas commensurate with community goals, as expressed in the Municipal Plan. The
regulations for the RHS Overlay District supplement the regulations of any underlying district that
otherwise apply. When the regulations of the RHS Overlay District and of the underlying district conflict,
the more restrictive provision(s) shall apply.
Section 1001 Applicability
(a) This Article shall apply to all development and redevelopment of properties in the Town of
Waterbury that are located in the RHS Overlay District, which comprises all lands at or above 1,200 feet
in elevation above mean sea level (hereinafter “FIE”).
(b) Development at or above 1,200 FIE but below 1,500 FIE shall be considered “minor” development.
Development and pre-development site preparation at or above 1,500 FIE, and clearcutting at or above
1,500 FIE that is not a prescribed treatment activity in an approved forest management plan for property
enrolled in the Use Value Appraisal Program for Forest Land pursuant to 32 VSA §§3752-3763 shall be
considered “major” development.
(c) The Use Regulation Table in Article V (Table 5.1) shall apply to the RHS Overlay District, except
that uses that are permitted in the underlying zoning districts, as set forth the Use Regulation Table, shall
be treated as conditional uses in the RHS Overlay District.
(d) The following activities shall not be subject to review under this article:
(1) Residential additions, accessory structures, camps whose combined footprint is less than or equal
to 800 square feet; and
(2) Structures that have been approved by the appropriate municipal panels before the effective date
of this article (3/14/2006).
Section 1002 Procedures
(a) No zoning permit for any land development within the RHS Overlay District shall be issued without
the prior approval of the Zoning Administrator and the Development Review Board, in accordance with 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 57
the following procedures and standards.
(1) Pre-Application Review: The applicant may schedule a meeting with the Zoning Administrator to
review the proposed site development plan(s), prepared in accordance with Section 1003. The purpose of
the pre-application review is to evaluate the site development plans, including the location and general
character of the site; to identify potential development constraints and evaluate the suitability of the
project in light of these constraints; to consider whether the proposed development should be classified
as “minor” or “major”; and to provide the applicant with clear direction as to the submission materials
needed for review.
(2) Project Classification and Notification of Submission Requirements: No later than 15 days after
submission of the complete application, the Zoning Administrator shall classify the development project
as “minor” or “major,” pursuant to Section 1001(b). The Zoning Administrator may seek the advice of
the Development Review Board and the Municipal Planner before making his/her determination of
project classification. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of the determination
and shall also identify any supplemental materials required as part of the application, pursuant to Section
1003.
(3) Reconsideration of Classification or District Boundaries: In the event that an applicant does not
concur with the Zoning Administrator’s determination that the proposed development project is minor or
major or that it falls within the RHS Overlay District, the applicant may appeal the decision to the
Development Review Board in accordance with Section 307(a). The Development Review Board shall
determine whether such proposed development is minor or major or is located within the RHS Overlay
District. The applicant requesting such determination shall bear the burden of proof.
(4) Review of Minor and Major Development Projects: Upon submittal of the final site development
plan, the Development Review Board shall schedule a public hearing in accordance with 24 V.S.A.
Chapter 117 [§4464]. The Development Review Board may require additional supplemental materials
and may continue the public hearing. After reviewing the application, the Development Review Board
shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove any such site development plan within fortyfive (45) days after the date of the adjournment of the public hearing, and failure to so act within the
forty-five (45) day period shall be deemed approval. Upon approval of the application by the
Development Review Board, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a zoning permit pursuant to all
applicable provisions of this bylaw.
Section 1003 Submission Requirements
(a) Minor Development Projects—Basic Submission Requirements: The applicant shall submit a site
development plan and all other information as required pursuant to Section 301(b), with the exception of
a grading plan unless otherwise determined by the Development Review Board. The Development
Review Board may request additional information it deems necessary and may visit the site to gather
information.
(b) Major Development Projects—Supplemental Submission Requirements: The applicant shall file the
information required for minor development applications. The Zoning Administrator or Development
Review Board may require supplemental materials prior to or during the review under Section 1004,
including but not limited to:
(1) Grading Plan: Existing and proposed contours of the land to be cleared and to a distance of fifty
feet beyond the cleared areas. The contours shall be field-generated and be set at intervals of no greater 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 58
than five feet. The plan shall show all clearing limits and the location of all existing and proposed
retaining walls over four feet in height.
(2) Visibility Studies: Line-of-sight sections, site photography, or other means to assess the visual
impact of the proposed application. On-site measures such as pole, stake, or survey tape layouts of site
structures may be also be required.
(3) Stormwater Drainage/Erosion Control Plan: A stormwater drainage and erosion control plan
shall be submitted for projects where the average slope of the site is 15 percent or greater or there are
perennial streams and waterways located on the site.
(4) Landscape Plan: Existing vegetation and proposed landscaping and clearing plans showing
proposed type, size, and location of existing woody vegetation to be retained and installed, particularly
for screening purposes, and describing the specific measures to ensure the protection, survival and, if
necessary, replacement of designated trees during and after the construction on or changes to the site.
(5) Access Plan: A plan showing existing and proposed roads, rights-of-way (ROW), parking areas,
and other relevant information (e.g., paving materials, clearing limits, slopes, etc.).
(6) Natural Features: Existing ponds, streams, rivers and other water features; critical wildlife
habitat, unique or fragile resources, and Class I and Class II wetlands located within and up to fifty (50)
feet beyond the boundary of the development site; areas characterized by slopes equal to or greater than
25 percent; and unique features such as rock outcroppings, gorges, and other geologic formations.
Section 1004 Standards of Review
(a) Development of lands identified within the RHS Overlay District shall comply with all other
applicable regulations, including conditional use review standards, within this bylaw and with the
standards of review set forth in the following subsections.
(b) Minor Development: Minor development projects shall be subject to conditional use review, as set
forth in Section 303, and all other applicable regulations.
(c) Major Development: In addition to the review applicable to minor development projects, the
Development Review Board shall find that the application for a major development project complies with
all of the following standards:
(1) Screening: Forest cover shall be maintained to the greatest extent possible. If there is to be treeclearing for views from the site, it shall be done so as to create view corridors. The Development Review
Board may limit the amount of tree-clearing and require the planting of additional trees or other
vegetation in order to assure adequate screening, and the Board may require the applicant to submit a
plan for maintaining and replacing designated trees during or after site development and construction.
(2) Access: Access roads and utility corridors, including the conversion of logging roads to private
roads or driveways, shall use or share existing accesses and rights-of-way where feasible, and shall
follow existing contours and linear features (e.g., tree lines, stone walls) where possible. In addition, they
shall be located to:
(A) Minimize stream and wetland crossings;
(B) Minimize impacts on steep slopes; and
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 59
(C) Minimize the need for road or driveway corridors of widths greater than 50 feet, with the
exception of limited lengths of the road or driveway where wider side slopes are needed to
prevent erosion.
(3) Placement of Structures: Consideration shall be given to the location of proposed or potential
structures relative to site conditions, existing vegetation, and the location of fragile features (including
but not limited to steep slopes, streams, and identified habitat and natural areas). The clustering of houses
and other structures is encouraged to retain larger blocks of forest and fields and to help retain the
aesthetic character and wildlife value of the RHS Overlay District. The location of proposed or potential
structures may be restricted to ensure that development:
(A) Is minimally visible, as defined in this bylaw;
(B) Is designed so that the height of any structure does not exceed the height of the adjacent tree
canopy serving as the visual backdrop to the structure;
(C) Is located so that buildings are not placed on existing steep slopes equal to or greater than 25
percent;
(D) Is located down-grade of ridgelines and is designed so that the proposed structures shall not
break the skyline; and
(E) Is located at or near the edge of existing and new clearings and fields or in the interior of existing
wooded areas.
(4) Exterior Lighting: The off-site visual impacts of proposed exterior lighting shall be minimized. All
exterior lights shall be shielded and downcast. The use of reflective surfaces and outdoor lighting fixtures
more than 15 feet above the ground shall be minimized. Bollard, low-post lighting and low-level, indirect
lighting is recommended. Spot or flood lights are prohibited.
(5) Clearcutting and Pre-Development Site Preparation: The proposed clearcutting and all harvesting
activities associated with it shall comply with "Acceptable Management Practices for Maintaining Water
Quality on Logging Jobs in Vermont," as published by the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and
Recreation, effective August 15, 1987, (as may be amended from time to time) and all other applicable
regulations.
(6) Natural Resources: The proposed development will be designed and maintained so that there is no
undue adverse impact on, or undue fragmentation of, critical wildlife habitat and wildlife travel corridors,
unique or fragile resources, or natural and scenic resources.
(7) Building Design: The massing of a single building or group of buildings shall be designed to
minimize visual impacts and contribute to, and harmonize with, the scenic quality of the surrounding
landscape. Building materials, including windows and roofs should minimize year-round visibility,
reflectivity, and night-time light impacts as viewed from off site.
Section 1005 General Provisions
(a) The Town may use U.S. Geological Survey maps drawn at no greater than 20' contour intervals;
geographic information system maps and data meeting the standards of the Vermont Center of
Geographic Information; a geographic positioning system (GPS) unit; or other means which are greater to
or equal in accuracy to determine elevations within the RHS Overlay District.
(b) In the event of a dispute concerning boundaries, elevations, measurements or land development, the
burden of proof shall be on the landowner.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 60
(c) There shall be no exemptions from the provisions of Section 1001, set forth above.
(d) Where a landowner conducts pre-development site preparation activities at or above 1,500 FIE prior
to obtaining a permit under this article, the Development Review Board may limit development to the
non-impacted portion of the property and may require the site to be restored to its pre-development state.
(e) If the Board determines that no conditions or safeguards it may reasonably impose would ensure
compliance with this Article, the Board shall disapprove the application.
ARTICLE XI DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT
Section 1100 Purpose
(a) In accordance with the 24 V.S.A. §4414(1)(E), the Downtown Design Review Overlay District is
established to protect and enhance architectural and historic resources within the district, to maintain and
enhance property values, encourage a consistently high standard of design in new construction and
renovations to support a pleasant, pedestrian-oriented village center, and strengthen the community’s
economic vitality and the downtown district’s historic function as a center for commerce, industry,
government, and housing.
Section 1101 Establishment of District Boundaries
(a) The Downtown Design Review Overlay District is divided into two sub-districts, the
Historic/Commercial Sub-District, and the Mixed-Use Sub-District, which are differentiated by the

boundaries of each sub-district are depicted on the Waterbury Village Zoning Map: Downtown Design
Review Overlay District.
Section 1102 Applicability
(a) The applicability provisions as set forth in Section 301(a) shall apply to development in the
Downtown Design Review Overlay District, except that one- and two-family, non-owner-occupied
dwellings shall be subject to design review under this article. No structure located in the Downtown
Design Review Overlay District and subject to review under this article may be erected, reconstructed,
substantially altered, restored, moved, demolished, or changed in use or type of occupancy without
design review approval of the Development Review Board in accordance with the following procedures,
requirements, and standards.
Section 1103 Dimensional Standards, Density, and Uses
(a) Downtown Design Review Overlay District standards shall apply to all permitted and conditional uses
allowed in the underlying zoning districts. Such uses remain subject to all applicable regulation of the
underlying zoning district. If the regulations of the Downtown Design Review Overlay District and of the
underlying district conflict, the more restrictive provision(s) shall apply.
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 61
Section 1104 Exemptions
(a) The following activities shall not be subject to review under this section:
(1) A change in use or type of occupancy that does not involve any of the following: any
intensification or expansion of use, any alteration to the exterior of a building, or any parking lot or
driveway construction;
(2) Routine maintenance of existing structures, including repairs and changes in paint color, siding,
and roofing, provided such maintenance does not result in the enlargement of the structure or a
significant alteration of the building façades (such as the modification of windows and doors, the
removal of architectural features, or a change in the roof line), and
(3) Any other project that the Development Review Board deems to be minor in character.
Section 1105 Review Procedure
(a) Applications for development within the Downtown Design Review Overlay District shall be
reviewed concurrently with applications for site plan review in accordance with Section 301 of this
bylaw. In the event the proposed development does not require site plan approval, the Development
Review Board shall approve or disapprove an application of a project within forty-five (45) days from the
close of the public review.
Section 1106 Application Requirements
(a) In addition to the information required under Section 301(b), applications for design review approval
shall include the following:
(1) Proposed architectural elevations (for each exterior wall) showing door and window types and
placement, and other exterior details;

(6) Other information as required by the Development Review Board.
(b) For minor changes to the exterior of the structure, the Development Review Board may waive one or
more of the application requirements set forth above. 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 62
Section 1107 Demolition of Historic Buildings
(a) Development Review Board approval is required for the demolition of any building or structure
(including residential) in the Downtown Design Review Overlay District that is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. The Development Review Board shall approve the demolition if it finds that
the demolition will satisfy the requirements of Section 411, and that:
(1) The structure is determined to be a deterrent to a major improvement that will be a clear and
substantial benefit to the municipality,
(2) The retention of the structure would cause undue financial burden to the owner (the owner bearing
the burden of proof), or
(3) The retention of the structure would create or pose a risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the
structure’s occupant(s) or the general public.
(b) In approving a proposed demolition, the Development Review Board may require that the applicant
provide, prior to demolition, detailed documentation of the structure’s historic and architectural features,
such documentation to be part of the permanent zoning records. Such documentation should meet the
requirements of the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation for documenting historic buildings.
Section 1108 Design Review Standards
(a) Prior to granting design approval, the Development Review Board shall find that the proposed
development meets the following standards, where applicable:
(1) Historic Structures (applying to all structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places):
(A) Original materials or materials typical of the architectural style of the structures shall be preserved or
replaced with like materials to the extent feasible and appropriate.
(B) Historic building features shall be preserved or replicated to the extent feasible and appropriate.
(2) Historic/Commercial Sub-District:
(A) New building designs shall reinforce historic streetscape patterns, including orientation and setbacks.
Building sites, including road and pedestrian networks, shall be designed in a manner that is integrated
and compatible with adjoining parcels and areas.

ARTICLE XIV DEFINITIONS
Section 1400 Definitions
(a) Except where specifically defined herein, all words used in this bylaw shall carry their customary
meanings. Words used in present tense include the future, and the singular includes the plural; the word 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 69
"lot" includes "plot," the word "building" includes "structure," the word "shall" is mandatory; "occupied"
or "used" shall be considered as though followed by "or intended, arranged or designed to be used or
occupied", "person" includes individual, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization.
(b) Doubt as to the precise meaning of any word used in this bylaw shall be clarified by the Planning
Commission.
ACT: The Telecommunications Act of 1996.
ACCESSORY USE or BUILDING: A use of land or building or a portion thereof that is customarily
incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the land or building and located on the same lot.
ADEQUATE CAPACITY: Capacity is considered to be adequate if the grade of service is p.05 or
better for at least 50 percent of the days in a preceding month, prior to the date of application, as
measured using direct traffic measurement of the telecommunications facility in question, where the call
blocking is due to frequency contention at the antenna(s).
ADEQUATE COVERAGE: Coverage is adequate within that area surrounding a base station where the
predicted or measured median field strength of the transmitted signal is such that the majority of the time,
transceivers properly installed and operated will be able to communicate with the base station without
objectionable noise (or excessive bit-error-rate for digital) and without calls being dropped. In the case of
cellular communications in a rural environment, this would be a signal strength of at least B90 dBm. It is
acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage as long as the signal regains its
strength further away from the base station. The outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage,
however, is that location past which the signal does not regain.
ADJACENT: A land parcel, area, or district that shares a boundary with, or that is directly across a public
road or right-of-way from, another parcel, area, or district.

200 continuous feet along that road or highway, and is at least 1,000 feet from the proposed building site.
VIEW CORRIDOR: A clearing of vegetation for scenic views, designed so as to maximize the views
from the site while rendering the structure(s) on the site minimally visible, as defined herein.
VIOLATION: For the purposes of Article VI, the Flood Hazard Area Regulations, "violation" means the
failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain
management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3 is presumed to be in violation
until such time as that documentation is provided.
WALL SIGN: A sign attached to, painted on, or otherwise affixed to the exterior of a building, the display
area of which is parallel to the building wall to which it is attached, and no part of which projects over six
(6) inches from the face of the building.
WAREHOUSE: Includes warehouse, wholesale establishment, bulk storage, and bulk sales outlet.
WILDLIFE TRAVEL CORRIDOR: A route that permits the direct travel or spread of animals or plants
from one area or region to another, either by the gradual spread of a species’ population along the route or
by the movement of individual members of the species.
YARD: Space on a lot not occupied with a building or structure. Porches, whether enclosed or unenclosed, 
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 86
shall be considered as part of the main building and shall not project into a required yard.
YARD, FRONT: Yard between the front lot line and the building front line extended to the side lot lines
of the lot. The depth of the front yard shall be measured from the street line to the front line of the
building. If a lot abuts a public street right-of-way, then that side of the lot shall be considered the front,
even if the access to the lot is through a private driveway from another direction.
YARD, REAR: Yard between the rear lot line and the building rear line extended to the side lot lines of
the lot. The depth of the rear yard shall be measured from the rear lot line to the rear line of the building.
YARD, SIDE: Yard between the principal building or accessory building and a side lot line, and extending
from the front yard to the rear yard.
APPENDIX A: SIGN DESIGN GUIDELINES
This section offers guidelines only and are not requirements. Because signage is intended to be visible and
attract attention, it has a significant visual impact on an area, particularly on one which seeks to maintain
its historic character and certain aesthetic qualities. Signage, as part of the overall character of an area, can
produce a lasting impression on visitors and shoppers. This section is offered to sign owners and sign
makers as a non-regulatory, voluntary guideline; it will not be used to evaluate a proposed sign.
Signs in Historic Districts
There are many areas in Waterbury with structures of historical and/or architectural significance, including
four designated historic districts. These historic districts are also consistent with original village
settlements, which remain characterized by mixed uses and a pedestrian orientation. Signage in these areas
should complement the character of the area and the structure it relates to.
Sign Types
The choice of sign should
depend upon the
surroundings and the
attention one desires to
attract. An abundance of
signs of many different sizes,
shapes, and heights in the
same area can be visually
chaotic and ineffective as
they compete for the
attention of the viewer,
particularly in business
districts. Signs with similar
materials, lighting, and styles
of support can provide a
unifying element to a village
or business district and
enhance the area for business
(Figure 3).
Ground signs are perhaps
best used in situations where
there is a large setback from
the street, where the attention
of fast-moving vehicles is
being sought, or where there
are several uses in one
building or complex.

Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 87 
Wall signs, or other signs attached directly on a building, are best used in pedestrian or village-scale
commercial areas. Figure 4 illustrates appropriate locations on a building for various types of signs.
Projecting signs are best used
for street-level and secondfloor business identification
where the attention of people
in slow-moving cars or
pedestrians is desired and
where little or no front yard
is available for a ground or
freestanding sign (Figure 4,
No. 8). Those identifying
second-floor businesses (No.
9) should be placed directly
beside a related window and
should not be higher than the
height of the window
opening. First-floor
projecting signs should not
project more than three feet
and second-floor projecting
signs should not project more
than two feet beyond the
facade of the building.
Windows provide an
excellent area for signs that
will not interfere with the
architectural details or
overall appearance of the
structure. Such signs should
simply state the name and
function of the business.

Fi~re 4. Sign types and placement
Covering the window with long lists of products, prices, and other information can create a cluttered and
unattractive appearance.
Freestanding signs are perhaps best used in areas of slow-moving vehicular traffic or pedestrian activity.
Freestanding signs work very well in intimate settings, such as court yards.
Placement
If two establishments share a common storefront (Figure 4, No. 1), ideally, both would use the same
basic sign format. Signs relating to street-level establishments should be placed within an information
band (No.3) immediately above the storefront (No. 1) or should be applied directly to the display
window (No. 2).
Waterbury Zoning Regulations, 5-16-16 Page 88 
The information band (No. 3) should not be longer than the overall length of the storefront (No. 1 ). If it
cannot be confined to the width of an existing band defmed by the storefront of the building, its
recommended height should not exceed two feet, six inches. Second-floor businesses should be identified
either by a street-level directory or a sign that is placed directly beside (No.4), immediately above (No.
5), or applied directly on a related window (No. 6.). A sign placed beside the window should be no
higher than the height of the window opening. A sign placed immediately above a window should be no
longer than the overall width of the window.
Third-floor businesses should be identified either by a street-level directory or a sign that is applied
directly to a related window (No.7). No signs should be placed on the facade of the building above the
second floor.
The size of words and the
overall sign should be kept in
scale with the viewer's
expected location and speed.
The sign should also scale
with the building it is
associated with. Larger, autooriented signs may be more
appropriate on Route 100 but
are generally not consistent
with the scale and pedestrianorientation of village areas
(Figure 5).

tiwure 5. Size and scale

The size of the sign should depend upon its expected location on the facade of the building so it does not
conceal significant architectural details (Figure 4).
Content
The message on the sign should be easy to read, direct, and simple. Too much information on one or a
group of signs my be difficult for a viewer to absorb (Figure 6). A sign using bold, easily recognized
symbols and clear, crisp lettering will effectively identify a business or activity, enhance the area in
which it is located, and complement the general appearance of the street. Pictures, symbols, and logos
can add individuality and character to signs, in addition to making them easier to read.

Materials
Materials should be selected
that are compatible with the
architecture of the building
and the character of the area.
For signs in historic village
areas and business districts,
consideration should be
given to how their materials
will fit into the surrounding
streetscape.

In Waterbury's historic village areas, for example, sign materials should be consistent with or
complement the construction materials and architectur~l style of the building or structure. Signs of wood,
either painted or carved, are usually most appropriate for the architectural features of villages. While a
variety of supports could be used, wood or wrought iron is recommended. Internally lit plastic signs are
generally not consistent in historic village areas.
Most signs need no more
than three colors: one for
background, a contrasting
color for lettering, and a third
for emphasis (such as
borders, motifs, or shading).
For an illustration
incorporated into a sign,
complementary colors should
be used (Figure 7).
Colors used for a sign should
complement the general tone
of the structure it serves.
When more than one sign is
used, the colors of the signs
should be coordinated to
present a unified image.
