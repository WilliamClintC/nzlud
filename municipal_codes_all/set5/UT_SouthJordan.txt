commissions and councils of the city which may involve the physical taking or
exaction of private real property without just compensation. (Ord. 97-1)

   A.   As used in this chapter: "Constitutional taking issues" means actions
involving the physical or regulatory taking of private real property by any
official, employee, board, commission or council of the city that might require
compensation to a private real property owner under:
      1.   The fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the United
States;
      2.   Article I, section 22 of the Utah constitution; or
      3.   Any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking
of private real property by a governmental entity.
   B.   Actions by the city involving the physical taking or exaction of
private real property is not a constitutional taking if the physical taking or
exaction:
      1.   Bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest; and
      2.   Is roughly proportionate and reasonably related, on an
individualized property basis, both in nature and extent, to the impact of the
proposed development on the legitimate government interest. (Ord. 97-1)
1.24.030: GUIDELINES:
The following guidelines shall be considered by any official, employee, board,
commission or council of the city when taking any action that might result in
the physical or regulatory taking of private real property without just
compensation.
   A.   Identification: The acting body should review the following items to
determine and identify whether a proposed governmental action raises
constitutional taking issues.
      1.   Does the action result in a permanent physical occupation of private
property?
      2.   Does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or
grant an easement to the city?
      3.   Does the action deprive the property owner of all economically
viable uses of the property?
      4.   Does the action have a severe impact on the property owner's
economic interest?
      5.   Does the action deny a fundamental attribute of ownership?
   B.   Analysis: If the acting body determines that a governmental action
involves constitutional taking issues, the proposed action should be reviewed
further to determine appropriate action. In reviewing the proposed action, the
following factors may be analyzed:
      1.   The effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of
the private property;
      2.   The likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional
taking;
      3.   Any alternatives to the proposed action that would fulfill the
city's lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking;
      4.   The cost to the city for payment of compensation if a taking is
determined;
      5.   The governmental interest involved and its nexus to the potential
taking; and
      6.   The proportionality and relationship between the proposed
governmental action and the proposed development. (Ord. 97-1)
1.24.040: APPEALS:
   A.   Application: Any owner of private property whose interest in the
property is subject to a physical or regulatory taking by the city, pursuant to
a final and authoritative decision or action by any official, employee, board,
commission or council of the city, may appeal the acting body's decision or
action by filing a written notice of appeal and statement of the grounds for
the appeal with the city recorder within thirty (30) days from the date of the
acting body's decision or action. Additional information regarding the claim,
such as property valuation and ownership, may be required in conjunction with
the application as deemed necessary by the city for proper review of the
action.
   B.   Review: The city council or its designee shall hear all evidence
regarding the appeal and determine whether or not the action by the city
constitutes a constitutional taking as defined in this chapter. The reviewing
body shall render its decision and findings in writing within fourteen (14)
days from the date the appeal was filed. The decision of the reviewing body
shall be given to the applicant and the official, employee, board, commission
or council that rendered the final decision giving rise to the appeal. When
determined to be necessary and appropriate, the reviewing body shall make a
recommendation to the official, employee, board, commission or council that
made the decision giving rise to the appeal.
   C.   Failure To Render Decision: If the city fails to hear and decide the
appeal within fourteen (14) days, the acting body's decision or action is
presumed to be approved. (Ord. 97-1)
1.24.050: LIMITATIONS:
The guidelines set forth in this chapter are advisory only and shall not be
construed to expand nor limit the scope of the city's liability for a
constitutional taking. The city shall have no legal liability to any person,

upon the city for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord.

upon a summary action calendar, which vote shall have the same effect as a
separate vote upon each calendar item individually. Prior to a final vote on
the summary action calendar, any member of the city council may object to the
inclusion of any item as a part of the summary action calendar, and upon such
objection, such item shall be thereupon removed from the summary action
calendar, and may be considered separately immediately after a vote is taken on
the remaining summary action calendar or at such later time as the city council
may determine. Any question, debate, or discussion regarding an item on the
summary action calendar, except in the nature of clarification or brief
explanation of the content of an item, shall be deemed an objection to
inclusion of such item in the summary action calendar. All items on the summary
action calendar which require public hearings shall be open for hearing
simultaneously, and the mayor shall announce, or direct the city manager to
announce, the titles of all such items. If any member of the public is present
and indicates a desire to comment upon any item in the summary action calendar,

comprising the summary action calendar. (Prior code § 2.04.070)

of an e-meeting, designate an alternative anchor location.
      3.   At least one council member shall be physically present for the e-
meeting at the anchor location. Space and facilities shall be provided at the
anchor location so that interested persons may attend, monitor, and participate
in the open portions of the e-meeting.
   B.   Notice Requirements:

members at least twenty four (24) hours before the meeting and shall describe

hold the e-meeting permitting the electronic appearance of council member(s).

work session or regular city council meeting if any two (2) members of the city
council (including the council member desiring the item on the agenda)
communicate their request to the city recorder or city manager. The council
member's requested item shall be placed on the appropriate agenda for the next
meeting where time permits. If the matter warrants more prompt action, the two
(2) members of the city council may specify the date of the meeting and where
the item shall appear on the agenda. (Ord. 2014-08, 4-15-2014)
   E.   If city council opts to use a first reading process, any city council
member may place an item on the first reading calendar of a regular city
council meeting by communicating the request to the city recorder or city
manager. At the city council meeting in which an item appears on the first
reading calendar, a city council member may make request that an item on the
first reading calendar be placed on an agenda for a future city council
meeting. If the request is supported by an additional city council member, the
item shall be placed on a future agenda. No vote is required to move an item
from the first reading calendar to a future city council meeting agenda. (Ord.
2017-16, 3-21-2017)

like nature, and shall make findings of fact from which he or she shall
determine whether the fee fixed by this title is discriminatory, unreasonable,

staff may investigate or inspect any business for which a license is sought

penalty, set for the license applied for, which fee shall be established by the

officer is whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the
hearing officer's recommendation.

judicial review of such decision pursuant to rule 65B, Utah rules of civil
procedure, or any other applicable statute or rule providing for such review.

5.80.010: DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT:
   A.   Findings Regarding Rights Of Way: The city finds that the rights of way
within the city:
      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the city;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare and general economic well
being of the city and its citizens; and
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement,
relocation and maintenance in the rights of way.
   B.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The city finds that the right to occupy
portions of the rights of way for limited times for the business of providing
telecommunications services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that
has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the city and its
taxpayers, and, therefor, the taxpayers of the city should receive fair and
reasonable compensation for use of the rights of way.
   C.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The city finds that while
telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce,
their operations also involve rights of way, municipal franchising and vital
business and community service, which are of local concern.
   D.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Telecommunications Services: The city
finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote
the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory
basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability
for municipal, educational and community services.
   E.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The city finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use valuable public property to serve the public;
      3.   Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of rights of way;
      4.   Protects the police powers and rights of way management authority of
the city in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
      5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the city infrastructure;
      6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights of
way; and
      7.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers
are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not
prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services within
the meaning of the telecommunications act of 1996 ("act") (PL no. 96-104).
   F.   Power To Manage Rights Of Way: The city adopts the telecommunications
ordinance codified in this chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights
of way, pursuant to common law, the Utah constitution and statutory authority,
and to receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights of way by
providers as expressly set forth by section 253 of the act. (Ord. 97-15; amd.

5.80.020: SCOPE OF CHAPTER:

applicable. (Ord. 97-15)

communications services provided by a provider within the city that the
provider is authorized to provide under federal, state and local law, and any
equipment and/or facilities required for and integrated with the services
provided within the city, except that these terms do not include "cable
service", as defined in the cable communications policy act of 1984, as amended
by the cable television consumer protection and competition act of 1992 (47 USC
521 et seq.), and the telecommunications act. "Telecommunications service" or
"services" also includes an open video system.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS: All conduits, manholes, poles,
antennas, transceivers, amplifiers and all other electronic devices, equipment,
wire and appurtenances owned, leased, or used by a provider, located in the
rights of way and utilized in the provision of services, including fully
digital or analog, voice, data and video imaging and other enhanced
telecommunications services. "Telecommunications system" or "systems" also
includes an open video system.
   WIRE: Fiber optic telecommunications cable, wire, coaxial cable, or other

(Ord. 97-15; amd. Ord. 2000-2; 2003 Code)
5.80.050: NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE:
The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing
the installation, construction, operation, use and maintenance of systems in
the city rights of way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The
franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the
city and provider. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.060: EVERY PROVIDER MUST OBTAIN:
Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, every provider must
obtain a franchise from the city prior to constructing a telecommunications
system or providing telecommunications services, and every provider must obtain
a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing open video
services via an open video system and shall be subject to the customer service
and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies. The
fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple
purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By
way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must
obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications
services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
(Ord. 97-15)
5.80.070: NATURE OF GRANT:
A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights of way. A
franchise is only the right to occupy rights of way on a nonexclusive basis for
the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the
right may not be subdivided, assigned or subleased, except as may be expressly
provided in a franchise agreement. A franchise does not excuse a provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before colocating
its system on the property of others, including the city's property. This
section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to
another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise. (Ord. 97-15;
amd. Ord. 2000-22)
5.80.080: CURRENT PROVIDERS:
Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting
without a franchise on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety (90)
days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. If such
request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the course
of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and
a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of
section
5.80.460 of this chapter. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.090: NATURE OF FRANCHISE:
The franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be
a nonexclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, operate,
repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights
of way in order to provide services. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.100: REGULATORY APPROVAL NEEDED:
Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the franchise, a provider
shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations or
licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
federal, state and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the city
upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits,
authorizations or licenses. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.110: TERM:
No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than
five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise shall be
granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.120: COMPENSATION:
As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this
chapter, a provider shall have the following obligations:
   A.   Application Fee: In order to offset the cost to the city to review an
application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or
charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, five
hundred dollars ($500.00) as a nonrefundable application fee. The application
fee shall also be paid when an amendment to an application is filed with the
city.
   B.   Franchise Fees: The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the
franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on
the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license tax or
fee enacted by the city.
   C.   Excavation Permits: The provider shall also pay fees required for an
excavation permit as provided in the city excavation permit chapter 1 . (Ord.
97-15)

be paid on a monthly basis within forty five (45) days of the close of each
calendar month. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.140: FEE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION:
Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be
accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated
and shall be certified as to its accuracy. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.150: FUTURE COSTS:
A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at the direction of the
city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and expenses that the city incurs
for the services of third parties (including, but not limited to, attorneys and
other consultants) in connection with any renewal or provider initiated
renegotiation, transfer, amendment or other modification of this chapter or a
franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable
financial cap at the outset of negotiations. Any costs associated with any work
to be done to provide space on city owned poles shall be borne by the provider.

use or occupation of the rights of way, the provider shall be responsible for
payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise
required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any
other fees payable pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.170: INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS:
In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before
the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from
such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes. (Ord.
97-15)
5.80.180: NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION:
No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for
additional sums payable. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.190: NOT IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES OR FEES:
The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment
except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable
law. By way of example, and not limitation, excavation permit fees are not
waived and remain applicable. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.200: CONTINUING OBLIGATION AND HOLDOVER:
In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system
after the term of the franchise, such operator shall continue to comply with
all applicable provisions of this chapter and the franchise, including, without
limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions throughout the period
of such continued operation, provided that any such continued operation shall
in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the franchise, nor as
a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the city as a result of such
continued operation after the term, including, but not limited to, damages and
restitution. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.210: COSTS OF PUBLICATION:

be liable for the costs incurred by the city to replace or repair and restore
to its prior condition in a manner as may be reasonably specified by the city,

franchise to the successor entity. Such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the city has reason to believe that the successor entity may not
comply with this chapter or the franchise agreement, it may require an
application for the transfer. The application shall comply with section
5.80.220 of this chapter. (Ord. 97-15 § 1)
5.80.360: IF PSC APPROVAL NO LONGER REQUIRED:
If the PSC no longer exists, or if its regulations or state law no longer
require approval of transactions described in section
5.80.350 of this chapter, then the following events shall be deemed to be a

books of account and records of the business, ownership, and operations of a
provider with respect to the system in a manner that allows the city at all
times to determine whether a provider is in compliance with the franchise.

in such a manner, a provider shall alter the manner in which the books and/or
records are maintained so that a provider comes into compliance with this
section. All financial books and records which are maintained in accordance

and records. The provider agrees to reimburse the city the reasonable costs of
an audit if the audit discloses that the provider has paid ninety five percent
(95%) or less of the compensation due the city for the period of such audit. In
the event the accounting rendered to the city by the provider herein is found
to be incorrect, then payment shall be made on the corrected amount within
thirty (30) calendar days of written notice, it being agreed that the city may
accept any amount offered by the provider, but the acceptance thereof by the
city shall not be deemed a settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute

known address of provider; 2) any system has been installed in the rights of
way without complying with the requirements of this chapter or franchise; or 3)
the provisions of section
5.80.090 of this chapter are applicable and no franchise is granted, a
provider, except the provider who is an incumbent local exchange carrier, shall
be deemed to have abandoned such system.
   B.   Removal Of Abandoned System: The city, upon such terms as it may
impose, may give a provider written permission to abandon, without removing,
any system, or portion thereof, directly constructed, operated or maintained
under a franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, a provider shall remove within a reasonable time the
abandoned system and shall restore, using prudent construction standards, any
affected rights of way to their former state at the time such system was
installed, so as not to impair their usefulness. In removing its plant,
structures and equipment, a provider shall refill, at its own expense, any
excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all rights of way in as good
condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially
interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires,
poles or attachments. The city shall have the right to inspect and approve the
condition of the rights of way cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to
and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this
chapter and any security fund provided in a franchise shall continue in full

provided for by this chapter, in any such case without renewal, extension or
transfer, the city shall have the right to require a provider to remove, at its
expense, all aboveground portions of a system from the rights of way within a
reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty
(180) days. If the provider is the incumbent local exchange carrier, it shall
not be required to remove its system, but shall negotiate a renewal in good
faith.
   E.   Leaving Underground System: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this chapter, a provider may abandon any underground system in
place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the rights of
way or with the use thereof by any public utility, cable operator or other
person. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.470: PUBLICIZING WORK:
Before entering onto any private property, a provider shall make a good faith
attempt to contact the property owners in advance and describe the work to be
performed. (Ord. 97-15)

In the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and a
franchise entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
(Ord. 97-15)
5.80.490: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter is held by any federal, state or local court
of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or
state statute, or is ordered by a court to be modified in any way in order to
conform to the requirements of any such law and all appellate remedies with
regard to the validity of the chapter provisions in question are exhausted,
such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct, and independent part
of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law is
subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed, so that the
provision which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with
such law the provision in question shall return to full force and effect and
shall again be binding on the city and the provider; provided, that the city
shall give the provider thirty (30) days, or a longer period of time as may be
reasonably required for a provider to comply with such a rejuvenated provision,
and written notice of the change before requiring compliance with such
provision. (Ord. 97-15)
5.80.500: NEW DEVELOPMENTS:

5.82.010: DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT:
   A.   Findings Regarding Right-Of-Way: The City finds that rights- of-way
within the City:
      1.   Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in
the business and social life of the City;
      2.   Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled
consistent with that intent;
      3.   Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other
public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for
profit to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-
being of the City and its citizens; and
      4.   Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper
management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the
taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and
negative effects upon the public from such facilities construction, placement,
relocation, and maintenance in a right-of-way.
   B.   Finding Regarding Compensation: The City finds the right to occupy
portions of a right-of-way for limited times for the business of providing
personal wireless services is a valuable use of a unique public resource that
has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to the City and its
taxpayers, and, therefore, the taxpayers of the City should receive fair and
reasonable compensation for use of a right-of-way.
   C.   Finding Regarding Local Concern: The City finds that while wireless
communication facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their
operations also involve right-of-way, Municipal franchising, and vital business
and community service, which are of local concern.
   D.   Finding Regarding Promotion Of Wireless Communication Services: The
City finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to
promote the rapid development of wireless communication services, on a
nondiscriminatory basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to
assure availability for Municipal, educational and community services.
   E.   Findings Regarding Franchise Standards: The City finds that it is in
the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for
franchising providers in a manner that:
      1.   Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;
      2.   Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under
which providers may use a right-of-way to serve the public;
      3.   Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that
may flow from such commercial use of right-of-way;
      4.   Protects the police powers and right-of-way management authority of
the City, in a manner consistent with Federal and State law;
      5.   Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use
of the City's infrastructure;
      6.   Protects the public's investment in improvements in a right- of-way;
and
      7.   Ensures that no barriers to entry of providers are created and that
such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the
effect of prohibiting personal wireless services, within the meaning of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "Act") (PL no. 96-104).
   F.   Power To Manage Right-Of-Way: The City adopts this chapter pursuant to
its power to manage a right-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah
Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable
compensation for the use of right-of- way by providers as expressly set forth
by section 253 of the Act. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.020: SCOPE OF CHAPTER:
This chapter shall provide the basic local framework for providers of wireless
services and systems that require the use of a right-of-way, including
providers of both the system and service, those providers of the system only,
and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide services.
This chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the
City prior to the effective date of this chapter, whether operating with or
without a wireless franchise as set forth in section
5.82.050 of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.030: EXCLUDED ACTIVITY:

otherwise regulated by other State, Federal or Municipal franchise or
ordinances.

5.82.050: NONEXCLUSIVE WIRELESS FRANCHISE:
The City is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive wireless franchises
governing the installation, construction, operation, use and maintenance of
wireless system in the City's right-of-way, in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter. The wireless franchise is granted through a wireless franchise
agreement entered into between the City and provider. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.060: EVERY PROVIDER MUST OBTAIN:
Except to the extent preempted by Federal or State law, every provider must
obtain a wireless franchise prior to constructing, operating, leasing, or
subleasing a wireless communication system or providing wireless service using
a right-of-way. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used
for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other
purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a
cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide
wireless services over the same system, must also obtain a wireless franchise.
(Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.070: NATURE OF GRANT:
A wireless franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in a right-of-
way. A wireless franchise is only the right to occupy right-of-way on a
nonexclusive basis for the limited purpose and for the limited period stated in
the wireless franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or
subleased. A wireless franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system
on the property of others, including the City's property. This section shall
not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another
provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-
2018)
5.82.080: CURRENT PROVIDERS:
Except to the extent exempted by Federal or State law, any provider acting
without a wireless franchise on the effective date of this chapter shall
request issuance of a wireless franchise from the City within ninety (90) days
of the effective date of this chapter. If such request is made, the provider
may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely
request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a wireless franchise is not
granted, the provider shall cease providing services until a wireless franchise
agreement is entered into. (Ord. 2018-25, 11-20-2018)
5.82.090: NATURE OF WIRELESS FRANCHISE:
The wireless franchise granted by the City under the provisions of this chapter
shall be a nonexclusive wireless franchise providing the right and consent to
install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under a
right-of-way in order to provide services. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.100: REGULATORY APPROVAL NEEDED:
Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the wireless franchise, a
provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations
or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate
Federal, State and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the City
upon the written request of the City evidence of all such approvals, permits,
authorizations or licenses. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.110: TERM:
No wireless franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less
than five (5) years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each wireless franchise
shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.120: COMPENSATION:
As fair and reasonable compensation for any wireless franchise granted pursuant
to this chapter, a provider shall have the following obligations:
   A.   Application Fees: A provider shall pay the following application fees
for the respective applications in accordance with Utah Code section 54-21-503,
as amended:
      1.   One hundred dollars ($100.00) for each small wireless facility;
      2.   Two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each utility pole associated
with a small wireless facility;
      3.   One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each utility pole or WCF that
is not permitted under Utah Code section 54-21-204, as amended.
   B.   Right-Of-Way Rate: A provider shall pay a right-of-way rate of the
greater of 3.5 percent of all gross revenues related to the provider's use of
the City's right-of-way for small wireless facilities or two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) annually for each small wireless facility in accordance with
Utah Code section 54-21-502(2). A provider does not have to pay this rate if it
is subject to the Municipal Telecommunications License Tax under title 10, part
4, Municipal Telecommunications License Tax Act.
   C.   Permit Fees: The provider shall also pay encroachment permit fees
required for any permit necessary to install and maintain the proposed WCF or
utility pole in the right-of-way.
   D.   Authority Pole Collocation Rate: The City adopts the authority pole
collocation rate as established in Utah Code section 54-21-504, as amended.
(Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.130: TIMING:
Unless otherwise agreed to in the wireless franchise agreement, all right-of-
way rates shall be paid in accordance with Utah Code section 54-21-502, as
amended. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)

which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its accuracy. (Ord.
2018-20, 9-4-2018)

A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties, at the direction of the
City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable expenses that the
City incurs for the services of third parties (including but not limited to
attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or provider-
initiated renegotiation, transfer, amendment, or a wireless franchise;
provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap
at the outset of negotiations. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.160: TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS:
To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities,
other than the City on the use of the City property as a result of a provider's
use or occupation of a right-of-way, the provider shall be responsible for
payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise
required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any
other fees payable pursuant to this chapter to the extent permitted by law.
(Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.170: INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS:
In the event that any payment is not actually received by the City on or before
the applicable date fixed in the wireless franchise, interest thereon shall
accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent State
taxes. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.180: NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION:
Acceptance by the City of any rate or fee shall not be construed as an accord
that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance
of such fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have
for additional sums payable. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.190: NOT IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES OR FEES:
A rate or fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other
assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by
applicable law. By way of example, and not limitation, encroachment permit fees
are not waived and remain applicable. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.200: CONTINUING OBLIGATION AND HOLDOVER:
In the event a provider continues to operate all or any part of the system
after the term of the wireless franchise, such operator shall continue to
comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and the wireless
franchise, including, without limitation, all compensation and other payment
provisions throughout the period of such continued operation; provided, that
any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other
extension of the wireless franchise, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if
any, available to the City as a result of such continued operation after the
term, including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-
4-2018)
5.82.210: COSTS OF PUBLICATION:
A provider shall assume any publication costs associated with its wireless
franchise that may be required by law. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.220: WIRELESS FRANCHISE APPLICATION:
To obtain a wireless franchise to construct, own, maintain or provide services
through any wireless system within the City's right-of-way, to obtain a renewal
of a wireless franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, or to obtain the City

be filed with the City. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.230: APPLICATION CRITERIA:

communication services within the State of Utah;
   B.   An annually renewed performance bond or letter of credit from a Utah-
licensed financial institution in the amount of twenty five thousand dollars
($25,000.00) to compensate the City for any damage caused by the provider to
the City's right-of-way or property during the term of the franchise agreement

in a park strip within the City's right-of-way and shall be installed and
maintained level with the surrounding grade.
         d.   Private Property: Any equipment installed on private property
must provide written permission from the property owner allowing the applicant
to locate facilities on the property. If equipment is placed in an enclosure,
the enclosure shall be designed to blend in with existing surroundings, using
architecturally compatible construction and colors, and landscaping and shall
be located as unobtrusively as possible consistent with the proper functioning
of the WCF. Equipment placed on private property may be subject to zoning
requirements in title 17 of this Code.
      2.   Replacement Utility Poles: If a WCF is collocated on a replacement
utility pole, the WCF's associated equipment may be installed in the following
manner:
         a.   To the extent technologically and economically feasible, a
provider must install the WCF's associated equipment within the replacement
utility pole in accordance with subsection A1a of this section.
         b.   If the installation of the WCF's equipment within the replacement
utility pole is technologically or economically infeasible, a provider may
install the WCF's associated equipment in accordance with any of the methods
established in subsections A1b through A1d of this section.
      3.   New Utility Poles: If a WCF is collocated on a new utility pole, a
provider must install the WCF's associated equipment within the pole in
accordance with subsection A1a or A1d of this section.
   B.   As required for the operation of a WCF or its equipment, an electric
meter may be installed in accordance with requirements from the electric
provider; provided, that the electric meter must be installed in the location
that: 1) minimizes its interference with other users of the City's right-of-way
including, but not limited to, pedestrians, motorists, and other entities with
equipment in a right-of-way, and 2) minimizes its aesthetic impact.
   C.   The City shall not provide an exemption to these requirements when
there is insufficient room in a right-of-way to place facilities at ground-
level and comply with ADA requirements, public safety concerns for pedestrians,
cyclists, and motorists, or other articulable public safety concerns. (Ord.
2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.320: UNDERGROUNDING:
A provider must underground its equipment in accordance with title 12 of this
Code and Utah Code section 54-21-207, as amended. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.330: VISUAL IMPACT:
   A.   Minimization: All WCFs shall be sited and designed to minimize adverse
visual impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public to the
greatest extent reasonably possible within one hundred feet (100') of a site
and consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.
   B.   Integration: WCFs and equipment shall be integrated through location
and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site. Such WCFs
shall be designed to be compatible with the built environment, through matching
and complementary existing structures and specific design considerations such
as architectural designs, height, scale, color and texture or be consistent
with other uses and improvements permitted in the relevant vicinity.
   C.   Decorative Poles: If a provider must displace a decorative pole to
collocate a small wireless facility, the replacement pole must reasonably
conform to design aesthetic of the displaced decorative pole and conform with
the City's Standards and Specifications for Small Cell Infrastructure. (Ord.
2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.340: STEALTH DESIGN/TECHNOLOGY:
   A.   Stealth design is required and concealment techniques must be
appropriate given the proposed location, design, visual environment, and nearby
uses, structures, and natural features. Stealth design shall be designed and
constructed to substantially conform to surrounding utility poles, light poles,
or other similar support structures in a right-of-way so the WCF is visually
unobtrusive.
   B.   Stealth design requires screening WCFs in order to reduce visual
impact. The provider must screen all substantial portions of the facility from
view. Such screening should match the color and be of similar finish of the
attached support structure.
   C.   WCFs and their associated equipment must be installed flush with any
pole or support structure (including antennas mounted directly above the top of
an existing pole or support structure) and the furthest point of an antenna or
equipment may not extend beyond eighteen inches (18") from the pole or support
structure except if the pole owner requires use of a standoff to comply with
Federal, State, or local rules, regulations, or laws. Any required standoff may
not defeat stealth design and concealment techniques.
   D.   Stealth and concealment techniques do not include incorporating faux-
tree designs of any kind that are not native to the State. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-
2018)
5.82.350: LIGHTING:
Only such lighting as is necessary to satisfy FAA requirements is permitted.
White strobe lighting will not be allowed, unless specifically required by the
FAA. Security lighting for the equipment shelters or cabinets and other on the
ground ancillary equipment is permitted, as long as it is appropriately down
shielded to keep light within the boundaries of the site. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-
2018)
5.82.360: SIGNAGE:
No facilities may bear any signage or advertisement except as permitted herein.
(Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.370: SITE DESIGN FLEXIBILITY:
Individual WCF sites vary in the location of adjacent buildings, existing
trees, topography and other local variables. By mandating certain design
standards, there may result a project that could have been less intrusive if
the location of the various elements of the project could have been placed in
more appropriate locations within a right-of-way. Therefore, the WCF and
supporting equipment shall be installed so as to best camouflage, disguise
them, or conceal them, to make the WCF more closely compatible with and blend
into the setting or host structure, to minimize the visual impact of the WCF,
supporting equipment, and equipment enclosures on neighboring properties, or to
interfere less with pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, and other users of a
right-of-way upon approval by the City. (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)
5.82.380: SITE PERMIT AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:

      1.   The City shall prepare and make publicly available an application
form, the requirements of which shall be limited to the information necessary
for the City to consider whether an application is a request to install a
nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole.
      2.   Upon receipt of an application for a nonpermitted macrocell or
utility pole pursuant to this section, the City shall review such application,
make its final decision to approve or disapprove the application, and advise
the applicant in writing of its final decision.
      3.   Within one hundred fifty (150) days of the date on which an
applicant submits an application seeking approval of a nonpermitted macrocell
or utility pole under this section, the City shall review and act upon the
application, subject to the tolling provisions below.
      4.   The 150-day review period begins to run when the application is
filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement between the City and the
applicant, or in cases where the City determines that the application is
incomplete.
         a.   To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the City must provide
written notice to the applicant within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
application, specifically delineating all missing documents or information
required in the application.
         b.   The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant
makes a supplemental submission in response to the City's notice of
incompleteness.
         c.   Following a supplemental submission, the City will notify the
applicant within ten (10) days that the supplemental submission did not provide
the information identified in the original notice delineating missing
information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent
notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this section. Second or
subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or
information that was not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
      5.   In the event the City fails to approve or deny a complete
application under this section within the time frame for review (accounting for
any tolling), the applicant shall be entitled to pursue all remedies under
applicable law.
   D.   In addition to the information required in section
5.82.380 of this chapter, a nonpermitted macrocell or utility pole application
must also include the following information:
      1.   The manufacturer's recommended installation, if any;
      2.   A written affirmation for the applicant that the macrocell or
utility pole meets or exceeds all applicable codes, applicable standards, and
Federal, State, and local requirements, laws, regulations, and policies;
      3.   A map that indicates the type and separation distance of other WCFs
owned or operated by the same wireless provider from the proposed WCF;
      4.   A visual analysis including to-scale photo and visual simulations
that show unobstructed before-and-after construction daytime and clear-weather
views from at least two (2) angles, together with a map that shows the location
of each view including all equipment and ground wires. Such visual analysis
must include a description, drawing, and elevations with the finished color,
method of camouflage, and any illumination;
      5.   A detailed explanation justifying why the WCF is required in a
right-of-way. The applicant must demonstrate in a clear and complete written
alternative sites analysis that multiple alternatives in the geographic range
of the service coverage objectives of the applicant were considered. This
includes, but is not limited to, explaining why the installation of permitted
small wireless facilities and the installation of a macrocell on private
property are insufficient. This analysis must include a factually detailed and
meaningful comparative analysis between each alternative candidate and the
proposed site that explains the substantive reasons why the applicant rejected
the alternative candidate.
         a.   A complete alternative sites analysis provided under this
subsection may not include less than five (5) alternative sites unless the
applicant provides a factually detailed rationale for why it could not identify
at least five (5) potentially available sites.
         b.   For purposes of disqualifying potential alternative sites for the
failure to meet the applicant's service coverage objectives the applicant must
provide: 1) a description of its objective, whether it be to close a gap or
address a deficiency in coverage, capacity, frequency or technology; 2)
detailed technical maps or other exhibits with clear and concise RF data to
illustrate that the objective is not met using the alternative; and 3) a
description of why the alternative does not meet the objective.
      6.   An explanation that demonstrates the following:
         a.   A significant gap in the coverage, capacity, or technologies of
the service network exists such that users are frequently unable to connect to
the service network, or are regularly unable to maintain a connection, or are
unable to achieve reliable wireless coverage within a building;
         b.   The gap can only be filled through an exception to one or more of
the standards herein; and
         c.   The exception is narrowly tailored to fill the service gap such
that WCF conforms to these standards to the greatest extent possible.
         d.   The manner in which the applicant proposes to fill the
significant gap in coverage, capacity, or technologies of the service network
is the least intrusive means on the values that these regulations seek to
protect.
      7.   A noise study for the proposed WCF and all associated equipment. The
application shall provide manufacturer's specifications for all noise-
generating equipment, such as air conditioning units and back-up generators,
and a depiction of the equipment location in relation to adjoining properties.
The applicant shall provide a noise study prepared and sealed by a qualified
Utah-license professional engineer that demonstrates that the WCF will comply
with intent and goals of this chapter.
      8.   The proposed WCF may not be closer than the average distance between
existing poles that are within one mile of the proposed site. If no poles exist
within one mile of proposed pole site, then all subsequently placed poles must
be at least two hundred fifty feet (250') from each other.
      9.   The design of a new pole must comply with the requirements of this
chapter and be approved by the City.
10. An affidavit certifying that the applicant has posted or mailed notices to
property owners within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed WCF site.
         a.   This requirement is not required to be met at the time
application is submitted, but is required to be completed prior to approval of
a permit.
         b.   The notice shall provide the following information:
            (1)   The applicant's name and contact information.
            (2)   A phone number for the provider by which an individual could
request additional information.
            (3)   A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type,
height and width of the proposed tower, separation distances, adjacent
roadways, photo simulations, a depiction of all proposed transmission
equipment, setbacks from property lines and the nearest buildings, and
elevation drawings or renderings of the proposed tower and any other
structures.
            (4)   Language that states "If you have any public safety concerns
or comments regarding the aesthetics or placement of this wireless
communication facility, please submit your written comments within 14 days to
the city". (Ord. 2018-20, 9-4-2018)

this chapter is adopted and those pending WCFs will be required to meet the
requirements of this Code.
   D.   Federal Compliance: The applicant must comply with all Federal (such as
the Americans With Disabilities Act), State, and local laws and requirements.
This includes, but is not limited to, participating in Blue Stakes of Utah as

Any damage done to another utility's or entity's property must be immediately
reported to both the City and the owner of the damaged property, and must be
promptly repaired by the provider, with the provider being responsible for all
costs of repair, including any extra charges that may be assessed for emergency
repairs. Failure to notify the City and the damaged property owner will result
in revocation of the franchise agreement. When approving the location for a
WCF, the location of utilities or other entities' property, or the need for the
location of other utilities, within a right-of-way must be considered before
approval to locate the WCF will be given in order to ensure those other
services to the public are not disrupted.
   F.   Standards And Regulations: All WCFs and utility poles must meet or
exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other
agency of the State or Federal government with the authority to regulate WCFs
and utility poles including, but not limited to, RF emissions. If such
standards and regulations are changed, and if WCF equipment is added either
through collocation or replacement, then the owners of the WCFs and utility
poles governed by this chapter shall bring such WCFs and utility poles into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of
the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling State or Federal agency.
Failure to bring WCFs and utility poles into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF
or utility pole at the owner's expense.
   G.   Applicable Codes: A WCF or utility pole must comply with all the
applicable codes and applicable standards.
   H.   Specifications: All structures shall be constructed and installed to

number for reporting maintenance problems.
      5.   The applicant shall provide a description of anticipated maintenance
needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs and

of-way upon which a WCF is located to inspect the facility for the purpose of
determining whether it complies with the applicable codes and applicable

upon reasonable notice to the WCF owner. In the event such inspection results
in a determination that violation of applicable standards set forth by the City
has occurred, the City will notify the provider of the violation.
      3.   Upon receipt of a notice of violation, the provider will have thirty
(30) days from the date of violation to correct the violation. If the provider
fails to correct the violation within the 30-day period, the City may remove
the violating WCF or utility pole at the provider's sole expense.

6.12.070: VICIOUS DOGS:
   A.   Definition: "Vicious dog" means any dog that, because of its aggressive
nature, training or characteristic behavior, presents a risk of serious
physical harm or death to human beings, or would constitute a danger to human
life, physical well being, or property if not kept under the direct control of
the custodian. This definition shall not apply to dogs utilized by law
enforcement officers in the performance of their duties. The term "vicious dog"
includes any dog that according to the records of the city police department,
or any law enforcement agency:
      1.   Has aggressively bitten, attacked, endangered, or inflicted injury
requiring medical attention on a human being on public or private property, or
without adequate provocation; or

vicious. The following factors may be considered in determining whether a dog
is vicious, but the court may consider others in its discretion:
         a.   Provocation in any attack by the dog;
         b.   The nature and severity of the attack or injury to a person or
domestic animal by the dog;
         c.   Previous history of aggression of the dog or inadequate control
by the custodian;
         d.   Observable behavior of the dog;
         e.   Site and circumstances of the incident; and
         f.   The dog's performance on a generally accepted or otherwise
reliable temperament test.
      2.   It shall be the city's burden to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that the dog is vicious.
   C.   Keeping Of Vicious Dogs: The keeping of a vicious dog shall be subject
to the following requirements in addition to those required of all dog owners
in South Jordan City:
      1.   Leash: No owner or person responsible for a vicious dog shall allow
the dog to be outdoors of its house, or to exit its kennel, pen or other secure

restrain the dog of not more than three feet (3') in length. A vicious dog
shall at all times be kept under direct physical control.
      2.   Kept In Enclosure, Muzzle, Exercise: It shall be unlawful for any
owner or person responsible for a vicious dog to allow the dog to be outside of
its secure enclosure unless it is either confined indoors in the custodian's
dwelling or building, or unless it is necessary for the dog to receive
veterinary care, in which case the dog shall be properly leashed and muzzled
with an appropriately fitted muzzle, such as a basket muzzle. Nothing in this
section shall prohibit necessary exercise for a vicious dog provided that it is
in the immediate presence of a custodian capable of controlling the dog, and
provided the dog is in nonpublic property within a secure fence or enclosure
from which it cannot escape, and which prevents entry by small children.
      3.   Confinement: Except when leashed, muzzled and under direct physical
control, a vicious dog shall be securely confined indoors or confined in a
locked pen or other secure enclosure that is suitable to prevent the entry of
children and is designed to prevent and actually prevents the dog from
escaping. The enclosure shall include shelter and protection from the elements
and shall provide adequate exercise room, light and ventilation. The enclosed
structure shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition and shall meet the
following requirements:
         a.   The enclosure must have secure sides and a secure top;
         b.   The enclosure must have a bottom permanently attached to the
sides, or the sides must be securely embedded not less than two feet (2') into
the ground;
         c.   The enclosure shall have a concrete pad for a base, with said pad
to be at least four inches (4") deep;

manner that the dog cannot exit the enclosure on its own; and
         e.   The enclosure shall be placed as close as practicable to the

to prevent the ready entry or exit of dogs, and shall prevent the entry of
small children who are not of the custodian's family. The enclosure may not be
part of or attached to the perimeter fence.

person taking custody or ownership of a dog determined vicious by a court that
the dog has been determined to be a vicious dog, and of the requirements that
must be met in keeping the dog under this section.
      8.   Failure To Comply: It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any
owner or custodian of a vicious dog to fail to comply with the requirements and
conditions set forth in this section. Any dog found to be in violation of this
section shall be subject to immediate seizure and impoundment. In addition,
failure to comply with the requirements and conditions set forth in this
chapter shall result in the revocation of the dog's license and the permit
providing for the keeping of such animal.

This section defines nuisance by providing five (5) general definitions of what
constitutes a nuisance (subsection A of this section), and then providing
specific examples of situations, conduct or activities that constitute
nuisances (subsection B of this section). The purpose of the general
definitions is to allow the city to classify an offending situation, conduct or
activity as a nuisance, even though the situation, conduct or activity may not
be listed as a nuisance in the specific examples. The first three (3) general
definitions are taken directly from state law. The purpose of listing the
specific examples is to identify some of the specific situations, conduct and
activities that the city intends to abate as nuisances.
   A.   General Definitions Of Nuisance: Any activity that meets any one or
more of the five (5) definitions set forth in this subsection shall constitute
a nuisance if it occurs within the city:
      1.   Nuisance as defined in Utah Code Annotated section 78-38-1(1).
Anything which is injurious to health, indecent, offensive to the senses, or an

this subsection is still a nuisance regardless of the extent to which the
annoyance or damage inflicted on individuals is unequal.
      4.   Nuisance: A condition which:
         a.   Wrongfully annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose,
health or safety of others; or

specifically listed as a nuisance in subsection B of this section.

8.24.040: EXCEPTIONS:
No act which is done or maintained under the express authority of an
authoritative statute, ordinance or court ruling shall be declared a nuisance.
(Prior code § 7.44.040; amd. Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.050: RESPONSIBILITY FOR NUISANCES:
The responsible person is responsible for abating nuisances pursuant to this
chapter. Any person, whether as owner, agent or occupant, who creates, aids in
creating, or contributes to a nuisance, or who supports, continues or retains a
nuisance, is responsible for the nuisance and is therefor a responsible person
pursuant to this chapter. Every successive owner or tenant of a property or
premises who fails to abate a continuing nuisance upon or in the use of such
property or premises caused by a former owner or tenant is responsible therefor
in the same manner as the one who first created it. (Prior code § 7.44.050;
amd. Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.060: NUISANCE ABATEMENT; ADMINISTRATION:
This chapter shall be administered and enforced by the police department and
the code compliance officer. In case of nuisances involving dangerous buildings
or violations of codes typically administered and enforced by other city
departments, this chapter may also be administered and enforced by the
respective departments. (Prior code § 7.44.060; amd. Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.070: FINDING OF NUISANCE:
If a code compliance officer finds that a nuisance exists, he or she shall
attempt to have the responsible person abate the nuisance. Although the
officer's first step in correcting or abating the nuisance will always be to
obtain voluntary compliance, the officer may pursue any remedy or combination
of remedies available pursuant to this chapter, state law or common law in
order to abate the nuisance. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to
prohibit the city from engaging in its standard prosecution practices.
Therefore, the city may prosecute violators of city ordinances or state laws
without first having to comply with the provisions of this chapter, even though
the activity or conduct prosecuted may also constitute a nuisance under this
chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to prevent the city from
enforcing applicable city ordinances, building codes, or the abatement of
dangerous buildings code without first treating the offending conduct,
situation or activity as a nuisance pursuant to this chapter. (Prior code §
7.44.070; amd. Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.080: VOLUNTARY CORRECTION:
This section applies whenever the code compliance officer determines that a
nuisance exists.
   A.   Contact: Before taking other steps to abate the nuisance, the code
compliance officer shall make a reasonable attempt to secure voluntary
correction or abatement of the nuisance by:
      1.   Contacting the responsible person, where possible;
      2.   Explaining the nuisance;
      3.   Requesting the responsible person to abate the nuisance; and
      4.   Agreeing to terms with the responsible person to abate the nuisance.
   B.   No Agreement: If the code compliance officer and the responsible person
cannot agree to terms for correcting or abating the nuisance, the code
compliance officer may still abate the nuisance using one or more of the
procedures set forth in this chapter, state law or common law.
   C.   Voluntary Correction Agreement: If the code compliance officer and the
responsible person agree to terms for abating the nuisance, they shall enter
into and sign a voluntary correction agreement. The voluntary correction
agreement is a contract between the city and the responsible person in which
the responsible person agrees to abate the nuisance within a specified time and
according to specified conditions. The voluntary correction agreement shall
include the following terms:
      1.   The name and address of the responsible person;
      2.   The street address of the nuisance, or a description sufficient to
identify the building, structure, premises or land upon or within which the
nuisance is occurring;
      3.   A description of the nuisance;
      4.   The necessary corrective action to be taken, and a date or time by
which correction must be completed;
      5.   An agreement by the responsible person that the city may inspect the
premises as may be necessary to determine compliance with the voluntary
correction agreement;
      6.   An agreement by the responsible person that the city may abate the
nuisance and recover its costs and expenses to abate the nuisance, as well as a
monetary fine pursuant to this chapter from the responsible person, if terms of
the voluntary correction agreement are not met;
      7.   An agreement by the responsible person acknowledging that he or she
waives the right to appeal the code compliance officer's finding that a
nuisance exists and waives the right to appeal the specific corrective action
required in the voluntary correction agreement; and
      8.   An agreement by the responsible person that failure to comply with
the voluntary correction agreement may be grounds for criminal prosecution.
The code compliance officer may grant an extension of the time limit for
correcting or abating the nuisance if the responsible person has shown due
diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting or abating the nuisance but
unforeseen circumstances render abatement under the original conditions
unattainable. If the responsible person complies with the terms of the
voluntary correction agreement, the city shall take no further action against
the responsible person related to the nuisance described in the voluntary
correction agreement unless the nuisance recurs. (Prior code § 7.44.080; amd.
Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.090: ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION:
   A.   Administrative Citation: When the code compliance officer determines
that a nuisance exists, and is unable to secure voluntary correction pursuant
to section
8.24.080 of this chapter, the code compliance officer may issue an
administrative citation to the responsible person. The code compliance officer
may issue an administrative citation without having attempted to secure
voluntary correction as provided in section
8.24.080 of this chapter under the following circumstances:
      1.   When an emergency exists; or
      2.   When the code compliance officer is unable to locate or determine
the identity of the responsible person.
   B.   Content Of Administrative Citation: The administrative citation shall
include the following:
      1.   The name and address of the responsible person; and
      2.   The street address of the nuisance or a description sufficient for
identifying the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the
nuisance is occurring; and
      3.   A description of the nuisance; and
      4.   The required corrective action; and
      5.   The completion date and a notice that the city may abate the
nuisance and charge the responsible person for all abatement costs if the
responsible person does not correct the nuisance before the completion date;
and
      6.   The time for appealing the administrative citation to the hearing
officer and the procedure for filing an appeal; and
      7.   A statement indicating that no monetary fine will be assessed if the
code compliance officer approves the completed, required corrective action
prior to the completion date; and
      8.   A statement that the city may abate the nuisance and assess costs
and expenses of abatement and a monetary fine against the responsible person if
the correction is not completed by the responsible person and approved by the
code compliance officer before the completion date.
   C.   Service Of Administrative Citation: The code compliance officer shall
serve the administrative citation upon the responsible person, either
personally or by mailing, certified, return receipt requested, a copy of the
administrative citation to the responsible person at his or her last known
address. If the responsible person cannot after due diligence be personally
served within the county and if an address for mailed service cannot after due
diligence be ascertained, notice shall be served by posting a copy of the
administrative citation conspicuously on the affected property or structure.
Proof of service shall be made by a written declaration under penalty of
perjury executed by the person effecting the service, declaring the time and
date of service, the manner by which the service was made, and if by posting,
the facts showing that due diligence was used in attempting to serve the person
personally or by mail.
   D.   No Extension: No extension of the time specified in the administrative
citation for correction of the nuisance may be granted, except by order of the
hearing officer. (Prior code § 7.44.090; amd. Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.100: OTHER REMEDIES:
The city may take one or more of the following actions against any responsible
person who fails to comply with the terms of a voluntary correction agreement,
an administrative citation, or an order of the hearing officer:
   A.   Abatement by the city.
      1.   The city may abate a nuisance when:
         a.   The terms of a voluntary correction agreement have not been met;
or
         b.   The requirements of an administrative citation have not been
complied with, or, if the administrative citation is appealed to a hearing
officer and the terms of the administrative citation are amended by the hearing
officer, the terms of the hearing officer's order have not been complied with;
or
         c.   The condition is subject to summary abatement as provided for in
subsection A2 of this section.
      2.   Whenever a nuisance is occurring which constitutes an immediate and
emergent threat to the public health, safety or welfare or to the environment,
the city may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of
such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the responsible
person as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.
      3.   Using any lawful means, the city may enter upon the subject property
and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The city
may seek, but is not required to seek, such judicial process as it deems
necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition.
      4.   The costs, including incidental expenses, of correcting or abating
the violation shall be billed to the responsible person and/or the owner,
lessor, tenant or other person entitled to control, use and/or occupy the
property and shall become due and payable to the city. The term "incidental
expenses" includes, but is not limited to:
         a.   Personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney
fees and costs;
         b.   Costs incurred in documenting the violation;
         c.   Hauling, storage and disposal expenses;
         d.   Actual expenses and costs for the city in preparing notices,
specifications and contracts, and in accomplishing and/or contracting and
inspecting the work; and
         e.   The costs of any required printing and mailing.
   B.   Monetary Fine: The responsible person shall pay the city a monetary
fine for each day the nuisance continues after the completion date. The
nuisance shall be considered to continue until the code compliance officer
approves the responsible person's actions to correct or abate the nuisance. The
amount of the monetary fine shall be as follows:
      1.   Twenty five dollars ($25.00) per day for each day during the first
week that the nuisance remains uncorrected or unabated after the completion
date;
      2.   Fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day thereafter until the
nuisance is corrected or abated according to the terms set forth in the
administrative citation.
The monetary fine shall be cumulative and may not be waived by the code
compliance officer. Payment of a monetary fine pursuant to this section does
not relieve the responsible person from the duty to abate the nuisance as
required by the voluntary correction agreement or the administrative citation.
The monetary fine constitutes a personal obligation of the responsible person.
Any monetary fine assessed must be paid to the city within fourteen (14)
calendar days from the date of mailing of the hearing officer's decision and
order or a notice from the city that the fine is due. The city attorney or his
or her designee is authorized to take appropriate action to collect the
monetary fine, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in collecting
said monetary fine.
   C.   Civil Actions: Either the city or any private person directly affected
by a nuisance may bring a civil action to abate or enjoin the nuisance, or for
damages for causing or maintaining the nuisance (including the cost, if any, of
cleaning the subject property). The civil action may be brought pursuant to
this chapter or pursuant to state law.
   D.   Criminal Actions: Criminal actions may be initiated by criminal
citation from the code compliance officer or by long form information.
      1.   Any person who maintains or assists in maintaining a nuisance is
guilty of a class C misdemeanor. No person shall be prosecuted under this
subsection unless the code compliance officer first attempted to obtain
voluntary correction as provided in section
8.24.080 of this chapter.
      2.   If the alleged nuisance is also a violation of a provision of this
code (other than this chapter) or state law, the responsible person may be
charged under the specific provision of this code or state law, even if the
neighborhood preservation officer did not first attempt to obtain voluntary
correction as provided in section
8.24.080 of this chapter.
      3.   Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes or interferes with the
city or its agents, or with the responsible person, in the performance of
duties imposed by this chapter, or a decision and order issued by the hearing
officer, or a voluntary correction agreement, is guilty of a class B
misdemeanor.
   E.   Abatement By Eviction: Whenever there is reason to believe that a
nuisance under subsection
8.24.030B1 through B6 of this chapter is kept, maintained or exists in the
city, the city attorney or any citizen residing in the city, or any person or
entity doing business in the city, in his or her or their own names, may
maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate the nuisance
and obtain an order for the automatic eviction of the tenant of the property
harboring the nuisance. The eviction shall take place as specified in state
law.
   F.   Lien For Costs: If a person fails to pay any fines or costs related to
nuisance abatement when due, the city may record a lien on the property or
premises for the full amount of the unpaid fines and costs.
   G.   Nonexclusive Remedies: The city may take any or all of the above
mentioned remedies (administrative, civil or criminal) to abate a nuisance and/
or to punish any person or entity who creates, causes or allows a nuisance to
exist. The abatement of a nuisance does not prejudice the right of the city or
any person to recover damages or penalties for its past existence. (Prior code
§ 7.44.100; amd. Ord. 2001-18)
8.24.110: APPEALS:
   A.   Grounds: Any person receiving an administrative citation may appeal the
administrative citation to the hearing officer. Only the following issues may
be appealed to the hearing officer:
      1.   The person charged in the administrative citation as the responsible
person is not the "responsible person", as defined by this chapter;
      2.   The condition described as a nuisance in the administrative citation
is not a "nuisance", as defined by this chapter;
      3.   The method required by the administrative citation to abate the
nuisance is inappropriate or is not the most cost effective method of
effectively correcting or abating the nuisance;
      4.   The time period given to abate the nuisance in the administrative
citation is unreasonable;
      5.   The monetary fine set forth in the administrative citation is
unreasonable;
      6.   The code compliance officer refused to approve a corrective action
that met the requirements of the administrative citation;
      7.   The responsible person claims that the requirements of the
administrative citation violates his or her constitutional rights.
   B.   Filing: The person desiring to appeal must file a notice of appeal at
the city recorder's office within fourteen (14) days of issuance of the
administrative citation.
   C.   Hearing: The hearing before the hearing officer shall be informal
according to rules and procedures established by the hearing officer. The
appellant may, but is not required to, bring an attorney or other
representative to assist him or her. The appellant and the code compliance
officer may each call witnesses at the hearing. The hearing officer may, with
or without the parties present, visit the site of the alleged nuisance. If the
hearing officer allows the parties at the site visit, both parties must be
given the opportunity to be present. The hearing shall be scheduled by the
hearing officer within thirty (30) days of when the notice of appeal is filed
with the city.
   D.   Burden Of Proof: The appellant shall have the burden of proof to
demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she had legitimate
grounds for an appeal. The determination of the code compliance officer as to
the need for the required corrective action shall be accorded substantial
weight by the hearing officer in determining the reasonableness of the
corrective action.
   E.   Authority Of Hearing Officer: The hearing officer shall have authority
to affirm or vacate the administrative citation, or to modify or waive specific
provisions of the administrative citation. If the appellant fails to attend the
hearing, the hearing officer shall affirm the administrative citation. The
hearing officer shall not vacate the administrative citation unless he or she
finds that no nuisance exists. The hearing officer shall modify the
administrative citation if he or she finds that a nuisance exists, but that one
or more of the requirements of the administrative citation is improper or
inappropriate. A requirement is improper if it is contrary to this chapter. A
requirement is inappropriate if the hearing officer finds that there is a
better means of resolving the problem or that the proposed solution is
inappropriate given the nature or severity of the problem. When determining
whether to waive or modify a requirement of the administrative citation, the
hearing officer may also consider:
      1.   Whether the appellant responded to the code compliance officer's
attempts to contact the appellant and cooperated with efforts to correct the
nuisance;
      2.   Whether the appellant has shown due diligence and/or substantial
progress in correcting the nuisance;
      3.   The financial ability of the appellant and the amount, if any, that
the appellant has benefited financially by maintaining the nuisance;
      4.   Any other relevant factors.
If the appellant appeals the code compliance officer's refusal to approve
appellant's corrective action, the hearing officer shall visit the site and
determine if the appellant complied with the requirements of the administrative
citation.
   F.   Order: The hearing officer shall issue a written order to the appellant
and the city notifying them of his or her decision. The order shall include the
hearing officer's findings of fact and ultimate decision. If the hearing
officer modifies or waives provisions of the administrative citation, the order
shall specify which portions are modified and how they are modified. The
hearing officer shall mail a copy of the order to the appellant and the city
within five (5) working days of the close of the hearing.
   G.   Appeal To District Court: Either the city or the appellant may appeal
the hearing officer's order by filing a petition for review of the order. The
petition must be filed in the third district court within thirty (30) calendar
days from the date the hearing officer's order was mailed to the appellant. In
the petition, the plaintiff may only allege that the hearing officer's order
was arbitrary, capricious or illegal. The hearing officer shall transmit to the
reviewing court the record of its proceedings, including any minutes, findings,
orders and, if available, a true and correct transcript of its proceedings. If,
in the opinion of the district court, there is a sufficient record to review
the hearing officer's order, the court's review is limited to the record
provided by the hearing officer. The district court may not accept or consider
any evidence outside of the hearing officer's record unless the evidence was
offered to the hearing officer and the court determines that it was improperly
excluded by the hearing officer. If, in the opinion of the district court,
there is not a sufficient record to review the hearing officer's order, the
court may call witnesses and take evidence. No petition or appeal may be filed
in district court unless the responsible person first appeals to the hearing
officer pursuant to the terms set forth in this chapter. (Prior code §
7.44.110; amd. Ord. 2001-18)

violation, no civil penalties may be assessed, but all other remedies are

recourse against the city for payment of any premiums due or for any
assessments under any form of any policy;

the city and its officers and employees against any claim or loss, damage or
expense sustained on account of damages to persons or property occurring by
reason of permit work done by the permittee, or his or her subcontractor or
agent, whether or not the work has been completed and whether or not the right
of way has been opened to public travel;

required insurance policies at any time. Consequently, the permittee shall be
prepared to provide such copies prior to the issuance of the permit.
   D.   If any of the required policies are, or at any time become,
unsatisfactory to the city as to form or substance, or if a company issuing any
such policy is, or at any time becomes, unsatisfactory to the city, the
permittee shall promptly obtain a new policy, submit the same to the city for
approval, and thereafter submit verification of coverage as required by the

authorized by a permit granted pursuant to this chapter. The amount of the bond
required may be increased or decreased at the discretion of the city engineer
whenever it appears that the amount and cost of the work to be performed, and
not satisfactorily completed, may vary from the amount of bond otherwise
required under this chapter. The form of the bond and the entity issuing the
bond shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney.
   B.   Public utilities franchised by the city shall not be required to file a

permit. The issuance and acceptance of any permit under this chapter shall
constitute such an agreement by the permittee to this section.
   B.   This chapter shall neither be construed as imposing upon the city, its
officers, employees and agents, any liability or responsibility for damages to
any person injured by or by reason of the performance of any work within the
public way, or under a permit issued pursuant to this chapter; nor shall the
city, its officers, officials, employees, agents, volunteers or assigns thereof

performance of any term or condition of the permit, written notice thereof may
be given to the principal and to the surety on the bond, if there is a surety
bond. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof,
and the period of time deemed by the city engineer to be reasonably necessary
for the completion of the work.

following the giving of such notice (taking into consideration the exigencies
of the situation, the nature of the work, the requirements of public safety and
for the protection of persons and property), fails either to commence and cause
the required work to be performed with due diligence, or to indemnify the city
for the cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice, the city may
perform the work, at the discretion of the city engineer, with city forces or
contract forces or both, and suit may be commenced by the city attorney against

such grave in cash at the time of purchase.
   B.   Present Grave Owners; Annual Maintenance And Collection Fees: As
established by the city council by resolution, annual maintenance and
collection fees shall be due and payable by December 31 of each year. In the
event the grave owner shall fail to pay the annual maintenance fee and
collection fee when due or within forty five (45) days thereafter, the city

maintenance and collection fee balance and the entire perpetual care fee at
once due and payable and may take action as provided in subsection
12.20.130C of this chapter for failure to pay the aforesaid fees. No portion of
the annual maintenance and collection fees shall constitute a credit toward the

12.20.130: FAILURE TO PAY:
   A.   New Grave Owners: No grave shall be transferred after the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter unless perpetual care for such
grave has first been paid in full.
   B.   Collection By Court Action: If any such person owning a grave as of the

the perpetual care fee or the annual maintenance and collection fees in lieu
thereof as provided in section
12.20.120 of this chapter and said fee remains unpaid for a period of twelve
(12) months, the city may pursue collection of said unpaid fee in a court of
law. A court action may be pursued against the owner or owners for the purpose
of seeking judgment for the unpaid fee and for reasonable attorney fees. Any of
the assets of the owner, including the lots or portions of the lots upon which
the owner has failed to make payment for maintenance services may be attached
or executed upon in such action as provided by the rules of the court and
otherwise by law.
   C.   Reversion For Nonpayment: As an additional alternate remedy against a
grave owner who fails to pay the perpetual care fee or annual maintenance fee
and collection fee as provided above, and in lieu of seeking collection in a
court of law, the city may cancel the owner's certificate or other document
representing rights to burial on unoccupied graves and cause ownership of said
graves to revert back to the city in accordance with the following procedures:
      1.   Hearing: The city council shall hold a hearing at a proper time and
place, at which the owner shall be given the opportunity to appear and present
good cause as to why his interest in the grave involved should not be
terminated and revert to the city for resale;
      2.   Notice: Notice in writing of the time, place and purpose of such
hearing shall be given by personal delivery or by mail to the last known
address of the owner. In addition, notice of hearing shall be published at
least once in a newspaper having general circulation in the county. The
publication shall be made at least three (3) weeks prior to the date of
hearing. If the owner or owners are known to be deceased, then mailing of
notice or delivery of notice shall be made to the last known address of any
known heirs. Copies of the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the
offices of the city;
      3.   Conduct Of Hearing: At the time and place set for hearing, the city
council shall give the owner an opportunity to be heard and allow the owner to
present witnesses and testimony and submit evidence showing cause why the grave
in question should not revert back to the city. After due consideration of all
the facts presented at such hearing, the city council may order, if it finds
there has been a failure to make payments of such costs and if no satisfactory
arrangements have been proffered for making prompt payment of such costs, that
the graves in question shall revert to the city and all rights and privileges
of the owner in said grave are terminated;
      4.   Redemption: A grave which has reverted to the city as above shall
not be sold for a period of ten (10) days after the hearing at which the
reversion of the grave is ordered. During said ten (10) day period, the former
owner may redeem a grave by paying the redemption price, which equals any
rearrangements in annual maintenance and collection fees for the grave to be
redeemed, together with the balance of the perpetual care fee then unpaid for
the grave to be redeemed and an additional fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per
grave to cover costs of the hearing and notice;
      5.   Repurchase: Within one year of the date of the hearing at which
revision of a grave is ordered, the former owner of a grave ordered reverted at
such hearing may purchase any available grave in the cemetery by paying the
redemption price of the reverted grave computed as in subsection C4 of this
section. This subsection shall not prevent such former owner from purchasing an
available grave from the city at the price listed by resolution of the city
council if the former owner prefers. (Ord. 2001-27)
12.20.140: HARDSHIP:
Notwithstanding the provisions of section
12.20.130 of this chapter, persons suffering hardship in connection with
payment of said fees and/or indigent persons may request an abatement by the
city manager, who is empowered to investigate the merit of such request if in
writing, and to abate all or part of the perpetual care fee in a particular
case upon a satisfactory showing of hardship or indigence. The city manager
shall review each such request on an individual basis and thereupon make a
determination in writing to the requesting party. The city manager's
determination may be appealed to the city council within thirty (30) days after
the date of the same by an aggrieved party by delivering a notice of appeal in
writing to the city manager or the mayor prior to the time of expiration of
said appeal. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, a hearing shall be scheduled
before the city council, at which the appealing person may present grounds for
reversing the decision of the city manager. The city manager may also be
invited to present the reason for his or her decision. When fully informed in
the matter, the city council may by majority vote affirm or reverse the
decision of the city manager. (Ord. 2001-27)

13.04.050: CONNECTION AND WATER SERVICE AUTHORIZED:
The water superintendent shall cause to be connected with the city water system
the service pipe of any property abutting on a city water main after the
property owner or his or her agent complies with all of the following
provisions of this section:
   A.   Application: The property owner, if other than a subdivider, fills out,
signs and files with the city billing office a complete application for water
connection on the current application form provided by the city. The city
reserves the right to amend its application from time to time.
   B.   Service Pipe: The property owner or his or her agents shall install a
service pipe to the curb or property boundary line of his or her property which
meets the following requirements:

      5.   The service pipe, when connected, will supply water to no more than
one building, except that where written permission is obtained by the property
owner from the water superintendent, connection of such a service pipe may be
added, if the property owner applying for the connection is the owner of all
buildings connecting to each service pipe. For the purpose of payment of fees

            (1)   There is a legitimate logistical concern with installing one
meter per residential or commercial unit,
            (2)   All of the units utilizing the shared connection are on the
same parcel,
            (3)   A single entity will be responsible for payment of the water
bill and administration of charges, as needed, to the other users serviced
through the shared connection, and
            (4)   The exemption better provides for the general welfare of the
city.
         c.   Water billing for this subsection B6 shall adhere to the city
water billing schedules as adopted under this chapter. When, upon request of
the property owner or his or her agent and upon approval of the city engineer,
multiple units share a single water meter, a base rate will be charged for each
of the connected units, whether occupied or unoccupied.
         d.   Water impact fees for this subsection B6 shall adhere to the city
water impact fee schedule. When, upon request of the property owner or his or
her agent and upon approval of the city engineer, multiple units share a single
water meter, the impact fees shall be based upon the equivalent number of
meters (meter size would be determined through engineering analysis to serve
each lot if individually metered), as if they were individually metered.
   C.   Inspection: The service pipe of the building to be connected has been
inspected by an employee of the public services department and found to conform
to these ordinances and to the state plumbing code. The service pipe and all
other underground water lines or connections shall be open and visible to the

utility company providing services to the public which evidences a good credit
history; or
      2.   The applicant provides the cosignature of a sponsor who is a
resident of the city and has a current water account with the city evidencing a
good credit history.
   G.   Fees For Water Service: Any person requesting water service shall pay a
fee for turning on the water service as such amounts are set forth in the city
fee schedule as adopted by resolution of the city council.
   H.   Payment: The person requesting water service shall pay said service
fee, before water service is provided, for the billing period in which he or

applicable statute of the state. No permit authorizing such alteration or
connection shall be issued if said alteration or connection results in the
availability of water service to a building to which such service was not
furnished before the alteration or connection is made, unless such building is
owned by the owner of all other buildings connected to said service pipe. Any
connection from an existing service pipe to a building to which water service
was not furnished before the connection is made shall be deemed to be a new,
original connection and the property owner shall pay to the city before

bills or a deposit made will be refunded promptly after receipt of notice of
discontinuance of service, except that an amount to be set by the city council
by resolution shall be retained by the city as a fee for turning off water

13.04.130: NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY:
If payment is not received within the billing period in which the charge is
made, the city billing office may send written notice to the person who
requested water service, if his or her whereabouts are known, and the current

water service was actually discontinued. However, notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this section, upon a finding of hardship, the city manager may,
at his or her discretion, agree to forbear discontinuance of water service for
a limited period of time and by special, written agreement with the water user
in arrears. After discontinuance, water service will only be reconnected when
any outstanding account charges are paid in full together with a reconnection
fee. Payments shall be made in cash or by money order only. (Ord. 2000-28)

or service. (Ord. 2000-28)
13.04.180: METERS:
   A.   Required: It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or entity to use or

temporary connections which shall be governed by approved regulations of the
public works department. The developer shall purchase and install water meter
boxes and stopcocks satisfactory to the public works department on newly
developed lots and real property at the time of water main installation. The
developer shall also provide the address prior to plan check approval. The
builder shall purchase the water meter satisfactory to the public works
department on newly developed lots and real property, and pay meter fees, at
the time a building permit is issued. The city will bill builder on a monthly
basis for water use at the city's current rate. City representatives will
install but will not maintain meters and boxes prior to final approval and
issuance of the certificate of occupancy for any residential home. Builder is
responsible for maintenance, repair and replacement, if necessary, of water
meter, meter boxes and lid until issuance of certificate of occupancy. Builder

after the date of the last previous test, the user will be required to pay the
costs of such test if the meter is found in such test to record more than one
hundred three percent (103%) of accuracy under methods of testing that are
satisfactory to the water superintendent. In the event a meter is found to be
recording more than one hundred three percent (103%) of accuracy, the city
shall make such adjustments in the user's previous bill as are just and fair
under the circumstances. If the user requests a test by an independent lab, the
user shall pay for such test and shall use a lab selected by the city.

   C.   Responsibility To Prevent: A user shall prevent any damage to the water
meter used by such user and shall pay the cost of repairing any damage to the
water meter other than normal wear and tear. Any amounts due by reason of this
subsection may be added to a user's bill for water service, and any amount
received from such user thereafter shall be applied first against the amount
due pursuant to this subsection and thereafter to any other amount due from
such user for other purposes.

of the state.
   B.   Charges: The regularly applicable charges shall be assessed for
unauthorized water service and may be collected as provided in this chapter.

pursuant to the South Jordan utilities service application and agreement, free
access at all ordinary hours shall be granted to the director of public works,
and his or her authorized representatives, to any place supplied with water
service from the municipal system for the purposes necessary to render such
water service. Such purposes include, but are not limited to, the examination

be notified at once of the fact and should said user fail to remedy the defect
within thirty (30) days, water service shall be discontinued until such
apparatus has been inspected by the water superintendent or his or her agent
and determined to be in a serviceable condition. Any deposit or prepaid charges
on the account of such user shall be forfeited to the city as an inspection and

said wastefulness has been given, the city may interrupt water service for up
to twenty four (24) hours per act of waste. Notice of an interruption made
hereunder shall be given at least one day prior to the time at which the
interruption occurs. It is a waste of water to permit water to run without
making due efforts to conserve the water.
   C.   City Council Action: When referred to the city council, the city
council may consider discontinuing permanently the water service to a wasteful
user. If the city council elects to consider the matter of discontinuance, it
shall give notice to the water user of the intention to discontinue his or her
water service at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting of the city council
at which such discontinuance is to be considered. The notice shall inform the
user of the time and place of the meeting and of the charges which led to the
consideration of discontinuance. Said water user shall have opportunity to
appear with or without counsel and present his or her reasons why the water
service should not be discontinued. Upon hearing, the city council shall notify

superintendent may specify by regulation combinations or number of outlets
which may have such effect.
   B.   The city shall, after a determination that such improper use exists,
notify the offending water user, or the owner of the premises whereon such use
occurs, of such determination in writing and order such use discontinued and
advise said person that such continued usage constitutes a violation of this
chapter.
   C.   If the usage described in subsection A of this section is continued or
resumed at any time from seven (7) days after notice is given by the city, the

continues after fifteen (15) days from when the city sent the written notice,
the water account holder will be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) and be
given a warning of subsequent fines. If the violation continues after fifteen
(15) days from when the city assessed the first fine, the water account holder
will then be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00). The city may assess
successive five hundred dollar ($500.00) fines every fifteen (15) days if the
violation continues. The city may waive any fine if the water account holder
attends a water conservation course administered by the city. (Ord. 2015-12, 9-
15-2015)

costs, for the local system are recovered by the city at which time the service
area shall be included in the gravity or pressurized service area as
applicable.
After the summary is completed, the city council may direct city staff to
prepare a petition for signature by affected owners in the proposed service
area. The petition shall include the summary prepared by the city. The petition
shall be circulated for signatures by the applicant. Seventy percent (70%) of
the affected owners in the subdivision(s) where the proposed service area is
proposed must sign indicating their desire for the creation of the proposed
service area before the city council proceeds to create the service area. Upon
submission of the petition, city staff shall verify that the seventy percent
(70%) threshold has been met by checking the signatures on the petition against
the county records of property ownership.
Once the petition is verified as meeting the requirements of this section, the
city council may hold a public hearing to consider the creation of the proposed
service area. At the expense of the applicant, the city shall notice all
affected owners that a new service area is proposed and the time and date of
the public hearing where a resolution creating the service area will be
considered by the city council. The notice shall include the summary for the
proposed service area.

This chapter is substantially similar to the county's ordinance relating to
flood control and drainage, and shall be construed in light of said ordinance.
(Ord. 2012-19, 12-4-2012)
13.12.050: PREREQUISITES TO DEVELOPMENT:
No subdivision shall be approved or considered for approval, no building permit
shall be issued, and no other approval or permit shall be issued or considered
by the city for any development, unless said development includes facilities
adequate to carry away and properly dispose of runoff, storm and flood water
which satisfy all of the following conditions:
   A.   File Plan: A plan drawn to scale by a licensed professional engineer
has been filed with the city which accurately shows the installation and nature
of the flood control facilities required by the specifications prepared by the
city engineer.
   B.   Stormwater Discharge Control: Site designs shall control the peak flow
rates of stormwater discharge to the amounts specified in the BMP manual.
Developer should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to
infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots,
and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical. Stormwater discharges to
critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., fisheries, wetland areas, Jordan
River, Midas Creek, Bingham Creek, Little Willow Creek, swimming beaches,
recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional
performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater
management practices. Stormwater discharges from "hot spots" may require the
application of additional engineered BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
   C.   Subsurface Water: If the development is located within the city and
east of 1700 West Street, then the following requirements apply:
      1.   Water Table Measurement: The city engineer may require soils testing
or water table assessments or measurements as may be reasonably necessary for
the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city in light of the
contemplated use of the land;
      2.   Minimum Requirement For Development: If the water table at any time
during the year is six feet (6') or less (measured from the surface), then
subsurface drainage facilities shall be installed according to plans prepared
by the developer in advance of the installation. Plans must account for
disposal of subsurface flows to the satisfaction of the city engineer.
   D.   Approval: The plans required by the preceding subsections shall be
reviewed and approved by the city engineer prior to the installation and found
to fully comply with all of the specifications prepared by the city engineer
relating to flood control and drainage, or in the case of subsurface facility
plans, are found to be satisfactory in the opinion of the engineer.
   E.   Bond: A cash deposit, escrow contract, surety bond or standby letter of
credit has been received by the city to assure complete installation of the
required facilities. Such bond shall be in a form substantially similar to that
required for subdivision plat approval pursuant to title 16 of this code. Said
bond shall be in an amount estimated by the city engineer to equal the cost of
the required facilities. Said bond may be incorporated and combined in the bond
required for subdivision approval.
   F.   Installation: The facilities for which plans are required in the
development shall be installed in the manner and using the materials required
by said specifications. Stormwater discharge during all construction activities
shall comply with the terms of the BMP manual and/or applicable requirements
set forth by the building code.
   G.   Inspection: Prior to backfilling any trench enclosing the required
facilities or otherwise obscuring them, all such facilities have been inspected
and found satisfactory by the city.
   H.   As Built Drawings: Drawings by a licensed professional engineer showing
the required facilities as installed have been furnished to the city.
   I.   Expenses: The requirements of subsections A, B, C, E, F and H of this

intermediate or major drainage system facilities constructed or to be
constructed within the city.
      2.   Residential Stormwater Drainage Fee Required: The owner of a lot
within a development or other undeveloped parcel of real property within the
city shall pay to the city a residential stormwater drainage fee, which fee
shall be applied toward the payment of a portion of the cost of the
intermediate or major drainage system facilities constructed or to be
constructed within the city.
      3.   Amount Of Fees: The amount of said fees may be set by resolution of
the city council and may thereafter be amended from time to time by resolution.
      4.   Accounting: All development stormwater drainage fees and residential
stormwater fees collected shall be placed in an account within the capital
projects fund under the account heading "flood control". Funds of said account
shall be expended and accounted for as provided in this code for accounts in
the capital projects fund for the collection, transmission, channeling,
retention, handling and/or disposal of surface water, floodwaters and/or
runoff. (Ord. 2012-19, 12-4-2012)
13.12.060: TEMPORARY FACILITIES:
The city may approve temporary facilities for on site retention so as to allow

determine the extent of discharges to natural water bodies, spills or determine
the status of stormwater related controls on private property, the city will
give twenty four (24) hours' notice of the inspection to take place and the
extent of the inspection. Equipment and manpower necessary to perform the
inspection will be allowed to access and work as necessary to determine the
state of the situation.
      3.   Emergency Inspections: During times of emergency including
discharges to natural water bodies, spills or potential damage to life or
property, the city may access the location of concern as necessary and with the
equipment required to determine the status of the situation. Reasonable
attempts to contact the property owner prior to the inspection will be made
prior to accessing private property.
      4.   Follow Up Inspections: During initial or routine inspections if
problems are identified which require corrective actions then a follow up
inspection will be scheduled.
   D.   Inspection Of Existing Facilities: The city engineer, or designee may,
to the extent authorized by state and federal law, establish inspection
programs to verify that all stormwater management facilities, including those
built before as well as after the adoption of this chapter, are functioning
within design limits. These inspection programs may be established on any
reasonable basis, including, but not limited to: routine inspections; random
inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible
violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than
typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of
businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges
of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more
likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of the city's NPDES/UPDES
stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other BMPs.

known to such person to have a water table less than ten feet (10') below any
point on the surface of such property, unless such person has disclosed to the
purchaser the fact that the water table is within ten feet (10') of the
surface.
   B.   Burden Of Proof: The burden of proving the sale or contract for sale,
the level of the water table, and the knowledge of such by the seller rests on
the purchaser. The burden of proving disclosure of the water table level rests
on the seller.
   C.   Remedies:
      1.   Misdemeanor: The violation of this section shall be a class B
misdemeanor, punishable as provided in the statutes of the state.

   B.   Industrial users required to apply for a discharge permit pursuant to
the district's pretreatment rules and regulations shall obtain such permit
prior to discharging into the sewer system. Applications shall be in the form
prescribed by the district. (Ord. 2013-18, 10-15-2013)
13.16.120: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE, PROHIBITIONS AND LIMITATIONS:
   A.   Generally: No person shall discharge into the sewer system any
substance or in a manner which, under ordinary circumstances, either: 1) is
harmful or detrimental to or interferes with either the sewer system, the
functioning of the sewer system, the environment or the public health; or 2)
causes sewage to pass through the sewer system without treatment and thereby
creating a significant health hazard or diminishing the quality of the
environment.
   B.   Discharge Prohibitions: No person shall discharge into the sewer system
any substance listed as prohibited in appendix A of this chapter or which in
any manner violates the wastewater discharge prohibitions and limitations
contained within chapter 2, section 2.2 of the district's pretreatment rules
and regulations currently in force and as amended from time to time, which are
incorporated by this reference as a part hereof as though fully set forth
herein, together with any schedules or appendices which are a part of chapter
2, section 2.2 of the district's pretreatment rules and regulations.
   C.   Immediate Reporting: Immediately upon discharging a prohibited
substance or upon discovering that a prohibited substance has been discharged,
the person performing or discovering such discharge shall immediately notify
the staff of the district of the discharge by the most rapid available means,
if such person knows or reasonably should have known that: 1) the substance was
discharged; and 2) the discharge of the substance was prohibited. Notification
pursuant to this subsection does not relieve the person notifying of any
liability, except liability for violating this subsection.
   D.   Preventing Accidental Discharge:
      1.   Generally: Every person conducting an activity which creates a
substantial risk that a prohibited substance will be discharged into the sewer
system shall provide adequate protection against accidental discharge of such a
prohibited substance by either: a) implementing procedures or practices which
tend to reduce the likelihood of such a discharge; and/or b) installing
facilities designed to prevent such accidental discharge. The district and/or
SVWRF may identify persons required to provide such protection and direct them
to comply with this subsection;
      2.   District May Require: The district pretreatment coordinator is
hereby authorized to specify particular procedures, practices and/or facilities
which shall be implemented by any person: a) if the district pretreatment
coordinator finds that there is substantial risk of a discharge prohibited by
this section if preventative measures are not undertaken; and b) if such
procedures, practices and/or facilities substantially reduce the risk of
discharge prohibited by this section; and c) if the cost of implementing such
procedures, practices and/or installing such facilities is found by the
district to be reasonable in light of both the potential damage to the sewer
system and/or the environment if an accidental discharge occurs, and the
effectiveness of the equipment in preventing such an accidental discharge.
      3.   Plans: In every case where facilities are required to be installed
pursuant to this subsection, the district engineer is authorized to require
submission of detailed plans for the required facilities and their operation
before construction of the facilities is begun.
   E.   Preventative Requirements:
      1.   Report: Within five (5) days after the discharge of a prohibited
substance, the person who discharged such substance shall file with the
district a written report describing: a) the nature and content of the
discharge; b) the cause of the discharge; and c) remedial measures to be taken
by the discharger to prevent similar discharges in the future. The district
pretreatment coordinator may inspect the site of the accidental discharge and
interview any person involved in the discharge in order to ascertain or confirm
what happened and assure that remedial measures adequate to prevent future
accidents are carried out as represented.
      2.   District May Require Changes: If: a) a person has discharged a
prohibited substance, and b) it is likely that the same person will again
discharge a similar prohibited substance in the future if preventative measures
are not undertaken, then the district treatment facility manager is authorized
to require the person who discharged the prohibited substance to make changes
in equipment, facilities, procedures or practices, which changes: a) have the
effect of substantially reducing the risk of a similar discharge in the future;
and b) are found by the district treatment facility manager to be reasonable in
light of the potential damage to the system and environment arising out of a
similar prohibited discharge in the future. Nothing in this subsection relieves
any person of any liability, except liability for violation of this subsection.
   F.   Self-Monitoring And Reporting: The district pretreatment coordinator is
authorized to require that persons discharging into the sewer system, other
than persons discharging only ordinary domestic sewage, monitor and report
their sewage discharges in a manner and to the extent necessary to: 1) provide
adequate compliance with the enforcement of the district's pretreatment rules
and regulations; 2) assess the source of the components of the sewage
transmitted, treated, and disposed of by the district or the SVWRF; 3) charge
reasonable fees and surcharges to dischargers based on actual discharges or
reasonable classifications of discharges. The district pretreatment coordinator
is further authorized to require that such monitoring and reporting be
performed at the expense of the person discharging. Every person required to
monitor and report pursuant to this section shall monitor and report as
required by the district's pretreatment rules and regulations and in conformity
with this section.
   G.   Compliance Monitoring: The district pretreatment coordinator is
authorized to sample and analyze the sewage of, and inspect the facilities of
persons discharging into the sewer system in order to determine or verify
compliance with this section. The district is further authorized to require the
installation of reasonable facilities, such as manholes, to enable such
sampling. However, nothing in this section limits any power that the district
or the SVWRF may have to investigate or enforce compliance with other sections
of this chapter or through means not specified in this subsection.
   H.   Strict Liability: Any person violating any provision of this section
shall be guilty without regard to fault, knowledge, intent or the state of mind
of the person committing the violation.
   I.   Nuisance: Any condition or situation which causes a violation of this
section is declared to be a public nuisance and may be abated as provided by
law. (Ord. 2013-18, 10-15-2013)
13.16.130: APPENDIX A - PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES:

13.24.160: Specific Standards
13.24.170: Floodways
13.24.010: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas located within the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in possible loss of life, damage to property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities,
and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from damage also
contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 2009-15, 8-18-2009)
13.24.020: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specified areas by provisions designed:
   A.   To protect human life and health;
   B.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   C.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   F.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   G.   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard;
   H.   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 2009-15, 8-18-2009)
13.24.030: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. (Ord. 2009-15, 8-18-2009)
13.24.040: DEFINITIONS:
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall
be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to
give this chapter its most reasonable application:

interpretation of any provisions of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent (1%) chance or greater
annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet (3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
   BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or

have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor
elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers),
or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and b) adequately anchored so
as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up
to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO,
AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by
means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30,
VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the
definition of "elevated building", even though the lower area is enclosed by
means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of section
60.3(e)(5) of the national flood insurance program regulations.
   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION: For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the
FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing
construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures".
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park for
which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on which the
manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation

source.
   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM: Those physical structural works for which funds
have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent
of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized
flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound
engineering standards.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including, but not limited to,
emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management
regulations.
   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: Zoning ordinances, subdivision
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances

the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within
one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The "actual start" means the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms,
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,

other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   B.   Any alteration of a "historic structure"; provided, that this
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this
chapter.
   VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine

reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee
thereof, or the federal emergency management agency for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder. (Ord. 2009-15, 8-18-2009)

to the community;
         e.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         f.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         g.   The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing and
anticipated development;
         h.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         i.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         j.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and

this chapter;
      6.   The director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the federal
emergency management agency.
   B.   Conditions For Variances:
      1.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base level, providing the items in subsection A4 of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-
half (1/2) acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance
increases;
      2.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section;
      3.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;
      4.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief;
      5.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         a.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         b.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         c.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
as identified in subsection A4 of this section or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances;
      6.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

project and that all of the improvements will be made available for the full,
effective, and practical use and enjoyment thereof by the purchaser, grantee,
assignee, transferee or lessee of any of the lands developed within the time
herein provided or in phases specified. Developments shall be planned and
developed to create connectivity through the continuation of roads, utilities,
drainage and other infrastructure to adjoining properties. Oversizing of lines
or infrastructure in the development may be necessary to accommodate future
development outside of the project. (Ord. 2013-01, 4-16-2013)
16.04.130: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED:
No tract or plot of land shall be divided, subdivided, reconfigured, developed,
or redeveloped except in conformance with provisions of this title and the land

As part of the development process, existing trees and vegetation shall be
preserved, as may be deemed necessary by the City. Vegetation may not be
removed, modified, or damaged on any land except in conformance with approved
plans and in conformance with this title and the land use ordinance. Existing
topography shall be preserved where possible. Development shall be designed to
minimize cuts and fills and scarring of land. (Ord. 2013-01, 4-16-2013)
16.04.160: LOTS AND PARCELS:
The following requirements pertaining to subdivisions, condominiums or other
developments shall be incorporated into project design and implemented by the
developer:
   A.   Size And Shape: Each lot or parcel shall be of adequate shape and size
to accommodate area, yard, frontage, width, parking, access, landscaping,
building and all other requirements of the zone in which the lot or parcel is
proposed and to accommodate reasonable use of the property.
   B.   Lot Constraints: Existing topography, easements, vegetation, waterways
and other natural or historic features of the property shall be accommodated in
the design of lots or parcels.
   C.   Lot Remnants: Every portion of a parcel being subdivided or recorded as
a condominium shall be included in a lot or lots in the proposed subdivision
plat or as common, limited common or private ownership in a condominium except
for public rights-of- way, parks or other areas dedicated for public use.
Nonbuildable parcels shall be so identified with clarifying information to
indicate their purpose. (Ord. 2013-01, 4-16-2013)
   D.   Flag Or Panhandle Lots: Flag or panhandle lots may be approved by the
Planning Commission in residential and agricultural zones after receiving a
positive recommendation from the City Engineer and Fire Code official in
compliance with the requirements listed below.
      1.   There is no feasible or practical way to subdivide the parcel or
gain direct access to a public street or future street system. It is not the
intent of this chapter to allow the proliferation of multiple flag lots along a
given street within a subdivision, or to change the zoning or character of a
subdivision. The creation of flag or panhandle lots is prohibited on lots
located in a recorded subdivision, except on a lot that:
         a.   Has a lot area that is at least twice the area of the average lot
area of the original recorded subdivision plat; and
         b.   Can be subdivided without causing the subdivision it is amending
to violate any requirement of this Code, including the applicable lot density
requirements of the underlying zone.
      2.   Approved flag or panhandle lots and the remainder lot of the
original parcel must comply with the applicable lot density and minimum lot
area requirements of the underlying zone.
      3.   The configuration of the flag portion of the lot allows a home to be
suitably built on the lot in compliance with minimum setbacks of the underlying
zone. Unless otherwise determined by the Planning Director, the side of the
home where the main entrance is located is considered the front of the lot for
building setback purposes.
      4.   The driveway access design for both the flag and staff portions of
the lot comply with Fire Code standards.
      5.   Access and cross easements may be required to accommodate similar
future development on an adjacent lot. To minimize the number of driveways,
parcels may be required to combine or share driveway access, based upon public
street access, driveway separation, and public safety.
      6.   A flag lot access may only be approved for:
         a.   A maximum of two (2) additional building lots created from the
original parcel; or
         b.   A maximum of two (2) additional building lots, one created from
the original parcel and another created from an adjacent parcel that also meets
all requirements for flag or panhandle lots.
      7.   The applicant understands and acknowledges in writing that
irrespective of any City approval, there may be covenants, conditions, and
restrictions on the parcel that the City does not review and cannot enforce
that may preclude flag lot development. (Ord. 2018-04, 1-16-2018)
   E.   Double Frontage Lots: These parcels may only be allowed where lots back
onto collector or arterial streets. However, the Planning Commission may, on a
case by case basis, approve double frontage lots elsewhere due to property
constraints, traffic considerations or other special circumstances. Double
frontage lots shall have the following restrictions:
      1.   A minimum six foot (6') decorative masonry or decorative precast
concrete wall shall be required along the rear lot lines of the double frontage
lots that are part of a new subdivision. However, if the double frontage lot
that is created is part of an existing lot or subdivision and the owner(s) of a
lot do not consent to the wall being installed on the existing lot line, the
wall shall not be required.
      2.   Double frontage lots may not be accessed from the street which is
established along the rear of said lots, unless otherwise approved by the City
Engineer. (Ord. 2018-23, 11-20-2018)
   F.   City And Zoning Boundaries: Individual lots or parcels shall not be
created which would be divided by a City boundary. Individual lots or parcels
that cross a zone boundary shall be avoided.
   G.   Side Property Lines: Said lot lines in a subdivision shall be
approximately radial or perpendicular to the street right-of-way line. Side
property lines shall be straight lines except where physical constraints of the
property require that the side lot lines bend or in order to facilitate more
efficient use and function.
   H.   Rear Lot Lines: Said lot lines shall be parallel or approximately
parallel to the front lot line except where physical constraints of the
property require otherwise or in order to facilitate more efficient use and
function. (Ord. 2013-01, 4-16-2013)
   I.   Property Line Adjustments: Consenting owners of adjoining properties
that comply with this subsection may apply for a property line adjustment. The
adjoining properties may be any combination of lots in recorded subdivisions
and/or parcels described by metes and bounds, regardless of subdivision
boundaries. (Ord. 2017-22, 7-18-2017)
      1.   Property line adjustments are subject to review by the Land Use
Authority, except that parcel boundary adjustments to resolve disputed property
lines between adjoining properties, while subject to Utah Code, are exempt from
review. The City Engineer is the designated Land Use Authority for property
line adjustments. (Ord. 2017-22, 7-18-2017; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 5-15-2018)
      2.   Applications shall:
         a.   Be filed jointly by the owners of all subject properties.
         b.   Include the legal description of each original property.
         c.   Include the proposed adjusted legal description of each property
as proposed. Legal descriptions shall be prepared by a certified surveyor or
engineer.
         d.   Include no more than three (3) properties. (Ord. 2017-22, 7-18-
2017)
      3.   The City Engineer shall hold a public meeting following proper
notice to all owners of property adjacent to the subject properties and
according to Utah Code and other applicable sections of this Code.
      4.   The City Engineer shall approve and provide a notice of approval to
the applicants for applications that comply with the following requirements:
(Ord. 2017-22, 7-18-2017; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 5-15-2018)
         a.   The property line adjustment will not result in a new parcel or
remnant land of any kind.
         b.   The properties as proposed will comply with this Code.
      5.   The property owners that are a party to the application shall record
with the Salt Lake County Recorder's Office within thirty (30) days of the
issuance of the notice of approval the notice of approval and a valid document
of conveyance that results in the property boundaries described by the legal
descriptions submitted with the property line adjustment application. (Ord.
2017-22, 7-18-2017)
16.04.170: EFFECT OF TRANSPORTATION PLAN:
Landowners shall take into account proposed streets and street widths indicated
in the City Transportation Master Plan in the planning of a development. Where
development is proposed, the landowner shall be required to dedicate and
improve any street, or portion thereof, which is planned in or necessitated by
the development and that is rationally related to the development's impact on
the City's transportation system. If deferment of the improvements is deemed in
the best interest of the City, the landowner/developer shall pay a cash sum in
the amount determined by the City Engineer. Where a planned street abuts or
traverses a property, required yard spaces shall be measured from the proposed
right-of-way lines of the street. (Ord. 2013-01, 4-16-2013)
16.04.180: STREETS:
The following requirements pertaining to streets shall be incorporated into
subdivision, condominium, SRD and site plan design and implemented by the
developer: (Ord. 2013-01, 4-16-2013)
   A.   Standard Street Rights-Of-Way:
      1.   Public Streets: Public streets are strongly encouraged. Proposed
public street rights-of-way and improvements shall comply with the City's
Construction Standards and Specifications and shall be dedicated to the City.
The City Engineer may allow or require other public right-of-way widths and
waive or modify requirements for pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalks and park
strips upon the applicant's showing of good cause (a reason rationally related
to the development) and in the best interest of the City.
      2.   Private Streets: Private streets are strongly discouraged. When
approved, private street rights-of-way and improvements shall comply with the
City's Construction Standards and Specifications. The City Engineer may allow
or require other right-of-way widths and waive or modify requirements for
pavement, curb and gutter, sidewalks and park strips upon the applicant's
showing of good cause (a reason rationally related to the development) and in
the best interest of the City. In all cases, however, pavement/subbase
thickness/depth shall be designed and built as required for public streets, as
described in the City's Construction Standards and Specifications. Streetlights
within private streets in PUDs shall be private and designed with a meter
setting per Rocky Mountain Power standards. Private streets shall be bonded the
same as a public street including, but not limited to, road construction, curb
and gutter, sidewalk, streetlights, storm drainage, and water system. At the
acceptance of the improvements by the City, one hundred percent (100%) of the
bond will be released with no retainage for warranty; except for those
improvements that will be publicly maintained and owned, if any.
   B.   Street Dedication: The developer shall dedicate rights-of-way and
install improvements for proposed streets which are planned to adjoin or
traverse the project or which are necessary for the development. The entire
proposed right-of-way shall be dedicated according to the design width
specified by the City transportation master plan and the City standard plans
and specifications unless the proposed right-of-way is planned to traverse
other properties not controlled by the developer. In such cases, the Planning
Commission may require a partial right- of-way width dedication or require
adjustments to the alignment so that only the developer's property is required
to be dedicated. Street improvements may not be required on other properties
which have been dedicated for future road development. In cases where only a
partial street is possible, said street shall have a right-of-way dedication of
no less than forty feet (40') and shall have sufficient pavement to accommodate
potential traffic as determined by the City Engineer.
   C.   Gated Developments: Unless otherwise approved by the Planning
Commission, gated developments are expressly prohibited.
   D.   Adjacent Properties: In order to accommodate access to an adjacent
parcel which is not a part of a proposed development and not sufficiently wide
enough to accommodate its own access, streets or private access shall be
planned and constructed adjacent to the project boundary in order to allow
future completion of the street or access improvements when the adjacent
property is developed. In such cases, the provisions of subsection B of this
section shall be implemented. With approval of the Planning Commission, the
developer may, by agreement with the City and according to procedures and
conditions recommended by the City Attorney, record a minimum one foot (1')
wide protection strip between the street and the project boundary or enter into
a pioneering/reimbursement agreement, except at the ends of "stub" streets, in
order to obtain reimbursement for public road improvements from the future
developer of the adjacent parcel. A protection strip may also be established
along any partially constructed street with approval of the Planning
Commission.
   E.   Future Access And Landlocked Properties: Subdivisions and other
developments shall be designed so that proposed streets/accesses will be
connected to existing streets/accesses, except if the existing street is a cul-
de-sac in a recorded plat. Development shall provide future access and
utilities (stub streets) built to City standards to adjoining developable
parcels, as needed, with the intent that all area properties have the
opportunity to be duly developed without being landlocked unnecessarily.
A metal sign shall be required at the end of a public stub street to inform
property owners of the eventual connection to future development. Recorded
plats shall also be required to indicate future street connections.
   F.   Block Length: To help promote accessibility and the spreading of
traffic, subdivision street design shall include a stub street at least every
one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), unless otherwise recommended by the
City Engineer and approved by the Planning Commission.
   G.   Secondary Access: For public safety reasons, secondary access for
specific subdivisions and site plans should be secured. By recommendation of
the City Engineer and Fire Code official, the Planning Commission may require
secondary public access for subdivisions with a total of ten (10) or more lots
and for sizable nonsingle-family residential developments.
   H.   Turnaround Access: Where a stub street is provided which accesses more
than two (2) lots on each side, a temporary turnaround and public use easement
or right-of-way shall be recorded as determined by the City Engineer. The type
and size of the turnaround shall be as determined by the City Engineer in
consultation with the City Fire Code official and shall be required on the
adjoining vacant land or on the subject development until the stub street is
opened to adjoining development. The City Engineer may require improvements to
be installed in temporary turnaround areas as deemed necessary.
   I.   Cul-De-Sac Streets: Cul-de-sacs, where approved, shall not be longer
than six hundred feet (600') in length as measured from the center of the
intersection of a connecting through street to the center of the turnaround
area. The Planning Commission may allow cul-de-sac street lengths greater than
six hundred feet (600') upon the applicant's showing of good cause (a reason
rationally related to the development) and in the best interest of the City,
with the recommendation of the City Engineer and Fire Code official. Cul-de-sac
streets shall terminate in turnaround areas as follows:
      1.   Eighty feet (80') (edge of asphalt to edge of asphalt, not including
gutter pan) for cul-de-sac lengths up to one hundred fifty feet (150'). Right-
of-way for dedicated turnarounds shall be a minimum of one hundred seven feet
(107') in diameter unless modified as per subsection A of this section.
      2.   Ninety six feet (96') (edge of asphalt to edge of asphalt, not
including gutter pan) for cul-de-sac lengths from one hundred fifty one feet
(151') to seven hundred fifty feet (750'). Right- of-way for dedicated
turnarounds shall be a minimum of one hundred twenty three feet (123') in
diameter unless modified as per subsection A of this section.
      3.   Cul-de-sacs over four hundred feet (400') in length shall require
the water line to be tied to two (2) feed sources, or looped, as approved by
the City Engineer and shall require fire hydrants to be spaced at a maximum of
three hundred fifty feet (350') apart. The City Engineer working with Public
Works Department and the Fire Code official may modify this requirement as
deemed necessary.
      4.   Cul-de-sacs under four hundred feet (400') in length shall require
that fire hydrants be spaced at a maximum distance of four hundred feet (400')
apart.
      5.   Cul-de-sacs shall be designed to allow stormwater to drain to the
intersection unless adequate drainage facilities are provided in the turnaround
area. (Ord. 2017-01, 1-3-2017)
   J.   Driveways And Subdivision Streets: Unless otherwise approved by the
City Engineer based upon the applicant's showing of good cause (a reason
rationally related to the development) and in the best interest of the City,
driveways and subdivision streets shall be designed and built as follows:
      1.   Driveways and subdivision streets shall approach an arterial or

for up to one year from the date of expiration upon the applicant's showing of
good cause (a reason rationally related to the development) and in the best
interest of the City. Site plans are required to conform to current standards,
ordinances and policies. An applicant may appeal the decision of the City
Engineer to the Planning Commission in writing, within fourteen (14) days if
denied. (Ord. 2009-03, 3-17-2009; amd. Ord. 2018-07, 5-15-2018)
16.24.090: PAD DEVELOPMENT:
A "pad" is a lot or parcel established for development of a freestanding use
and building, typically near a street, which is subordinate or related to a
shopping center, office complex or other nonresidential development. A pad may
only be created and developed as part of a larger shopping center or
development which exists or is or will be under construction (foundation
installed) at the time a building permit is issued for the pad. The following
regulations shall apply to pads:
   A.   Development Review Required: Pads proposed for development shall be
governed by this section and the development review requirements of this title
and title 17 of this Code.
   B.   Site Plan Approval Required: All uses proposed on pads may be
established only with a site plan approved by the Planning Commission. Approval
will be required at the time a pad or pads are proposed with the larger
development or at the time a specific pad use is proposed. The Planning
Commission may evaluate proposed pads and pad uses and their potential effects
on traffic circulation, safety, visibility and function of surrounding
development.
   C.   Plat Required: If a pad is to be sold, a lot or condominium space must
be created through plat approval procedures and meet all requirements of this
Code and State law.

culinary water resources are used for outdoor purposes, including watering
landscaping, and 3) the city desires to promote the design, installation and
maintenance of landscapes that are both attractive and water efficient.
   B.   The city council has determined that it is in the public interest to
conserve the public water resources and to promote water efficient landscaping.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect and enhance the community's
environmental, economic, recreational and aesthetic resources by promoting
efficient use of water in the community's landscaped areas, reducing water
waste and establishing a process for design, installation and maintenance of
water efficient landscaping throughout the city. (Ord. 2007-01, 1-16-2007)

water needs, areas with similar microclimate (i.e., slope, exposure, wind,
etc.) and soil conditions, and areas that will be similarly irrigated. A
landscaped zone can be served by one irrigation valve, or a set of valves with
the same schedule.
   LANDSCAPING: Any combination of living plants, such as trees, shrubs, vines,
ground covers, flowers, turf or ornamental grass; natural features such as
rock, stone or bark chips; and structural features, including, but not limited
to, fountains, reflecting pools, outdoor artwork, screen walls, fences or
benches.

   RECONSTRUCTED LANDSCAPING: Any existing approved landscaping and irrigation
that is removed and replaced as part of new construction.
   REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION RATE OR ETO: The standard measurement of
environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETO is expressed
in inches per day, month or year and is an estimate of the evapotranspiration
of a large field of four (4) to five inches (5") tall, cool season grass that
is well watered. The average growing season ETO for the South Jordan City area
is based on the weekly calculation made by Utah State University which can be
found on its internet web page. See also definition of Evapotranspiration (ET).
   RUNOFF: Irrigation water that is not absorbed by the soil or landscaped area
to which it is applied and which flows onto other areas.

premises, and to know the manner and extent of his water use and excess runoff;
   B.   The excessive use, loss or escape of water through breaks, leaks or
malfunctions in the water user's plumbing for any period of time after such
escape of water should reasonably have been discovered and corrected. It shall
be presumed that a period of forty eight (48) hours after the water user
discovers such break, leak or malfunction or receives notice from the city of
such condition, whichever occurs first, is a reasonable time to correct such
condition; and
   C.   Washing sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts or other
paved areas except to alleviate immediate fire, health or safety hazards.
   WATER CHECK: A water use efficiency review. See also definition of Water Use

assembly that are in compliance with state code shall be installed for
landscape irrigation systems, and the landscape water meter and backflow
prevention assembly shall be separate from the water meter and backflow
prevention assembly installed for indoor uses. The size of the meter shall be
determined based on irrigation demand.
         c.   Pressure Regulation: A pressure regulating valve shall be
installed and maintained by the consumer if the static service pressure exceeds
eighty (80) pounds per square inch (psi). The pressure regulating valve shall
be located between the landscape water meter and the first point of water use,
or first point of division in the pipe, and shall be set at the manufacturer's
recommended pressure for sprinklers.
         d.   Automatic Controller: All irrigation systems shall include an
electric automatic controller with multiple program and multiple repeat cycle
capabilities and a flexible calendar program. All controllers shall be equipped
with an automatic rain shutoff device.
         e.   Slope Runoff: On slopes exceeding thirty percent (30%), the
irrigation system shall consist of drip emitters, bubblers or sprinklers with a
maximum precipitation rate of 0.85 inches per hour and adjusted sprinkler cycle
to eliminate runoff.
         f.   Valves: Each valve shall irrigate a landscape with similar site,
slope and soil conditions and plant materials with similar watering needs. Turf
and nonturf areas shall be irrigated on separate valves.
         g.   Drip Emitters And Bubblers: Drip emitters or a bubbler shall be
provided for each tree where practicable. Bubblers shall not exceed 1.5 gallons
per minute per device. Bubblers for trees shall be placed on a separate valve
unless specifically exempted by the public services department due to the
limited number of trees on the project site.
         h.   Sprinklers: Sprinklers shall have matched precipitation rates
with each control valve circuit.
         i.   Elevation Variations: Check valves shall be required where
elevation differences will cause low head drainage. Pressure compensating
valves and sprinklers shall be required where a significant variation in water
pressure will occur within the irrigation system due to elevation differences.
         j.   Drip Lines: Drip irrigation lines shall be placed underground or
otherwise permanently covered, except for drip emitters and where approved as a
temporary installation. Filters and end flush valves shall be provided as
necessary.
         k.   Overhead Sprinklers: Irrigation zones with overhead spray or
stream sprinklers shall be designed to operate between six o'clock (6:00) P.M.
and ten o'clock (10:00) A.M. to reduce water loss from wind and evaporation.
This would exclude drip or bubbler zones.
         l.   Soils With Slow Infiltration: Program valves for multiple repeat
cycles where necessary to reduce runoff, particularly slopes and soils with
slow infiltration rates.
   D.   Plan Review, Construction Inspection And Postconstruction Monitoring:
The following procedures shall be implemented in the plan review, construction
inspection and postconstruction monitoring of landscaping:
      1.   As part of the site plan review and building permit process, a copy
of the landscape plan documentation package shall be submitted to the city for

license, insurance and bonding requirements, and be able to show proof of such
upon demand.
      5.   During construction, site inspection of the landscaping may be
performed by the city (see section
16.30.060 of this chapter).
      6.   Following construction and prior to the release of the improvement
guarantee bond posted for the project, an inspection shall be scheduled with
the public services department to verify compliance with the approved landscape
and irrigation plans.
      7.   Following construction and prior to release of the improvement
guarantee bond posted for the project, a water use efficiency review will be
conducted by a landscape irrigation auditor. The auditor shall be independent
of the contractor, design firm and owner/developer of the project. The water
performance audit will verify that the irrigation system complies with the
minimum standards required by this chapter. The minimum efficiency required for
the irrigation system is between fifty percent (50%) and sixty percent (60%)
for distribution efficiency for all fixed spray systems and between sixty
percent (60%) and seventy percent (70%) distribution efficiency for all rotor
systems. The auditor shall furnish a certificate to the city, the designer, the
installer and the owner/developer certifying compliance with the minimum
distribution requirements, and an irrigation schedule. Compliance with this
provision is required before the city will release the bond for the project.

   A.   The city council has found that: 1) there is a need for public
facilities for new developments which have not been constructed and are
required to be consistent with the city's general plan and to protect the
public health, safety and welfare, and 2) the rapid and continuing growth of
the city necessitates the imposition and collection of impact fees pursuant to
law that require development to pay its fair share of the cost of providing
public facilities occasioned by the demands and needs of the development
project at service levels necessary to promote and preserve the public health,
safety and welfare.
   B.   The city council has adopted a development impact fee calculation and

detail which establishes the costs for providing public facilities occasioned
by development projects within the city and certain credits allowable against
impact fees in the city.
   C.   The city council has determined that: 1) the impact fees established by
this chapter are based upon the costs which are generated through the need for
new facilities and other capital acquisition costs required, incrementally, by
new development within the city, and 2) the impact fees established by this
chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public facilities
occasioned by development projects within the city. (Ord. 2007-01, 1-16-2007)

Side and rear yard swales and drainage facilities shall be designed into
projects as an integral component of the stormwater system of the project which
needs to transfer stormwater runoff from the rear and side yards to the street,
or to other rear yard stormwater facilities. These swales or drain facilities
shall be designed and constructed in such a way that they become a permanent
feature of the side and/or rear yard and shall be constructed of a material as
approved by the city which prevents erosion. Inspections of these swales or
drain facilities shall be conducted during the subdivision construction phase
of the project and during lot level development. Developers are to provide
recorded drainage easements wide enough to provide for the possible slight
field relocation of rear and side yard drainage swales, or other drainage
facilities. At a minimum, the drainage easement shall be for the width of the

Weekends and holidays are not counted in determining the time for the giving of
notice and the holding of the conference. With the consent of the land
disturbance permit holder, the time periods provided for herein may be
shortened or extended.
In the case of an emergency, and only where an unacceptable level of risk to
public health, safety and welfare would incur from any delay, the notification
deadlines may be disregarded and the city engineer may act decisively to reduce
or eliminate the hazard. In such a situation, the city engineer will then make
every reasonable effort to confer with the land disturbance permit holder in a
timely manner to resolve the concerns, which resulted in the suspension. Costs,
including additional city staff time and equipment, shall be borne by the land
disturbance permit holder. (Ord. 2012-18, 12-4-2012)
16.44.710: CESSATION OF WORK:
Upon receipt of the notice of intended suspension or revocation, the land
disturbance permit holder is to cease all work in connection with the land
disturbance permit, with the exception of work necessary to correct any
condition cited in the notice of proposed action as a ground for suspension or
revocation, and work of an emergency nature. The time necessary for completion
of these emergency corrections will be determined by the city engineer. (Ord.
2012-18, 12-4-2012)
16.44.720: DECISION OF SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION:
   A.   Within twenty four (24) hours following the conclusion of the
conference, the city engineer or designee is to render a written decision,
either revoking the land disturbance permit, suspending the land disturbance
permit, or authorizing the land disturbance permit holder to proceed with the
work. Such action may be with or without conditions. The decision is to be
served upon the land disturbance permit holder by personal service or by first
class mail, postage prepaid, within twenty four (24) hours after the rendition
of the decision.
   B.   If the land disturbance permit holder fails to correct the
objectionable or emergency conditions causing the revocation or suspension, the
city may cause the work necessary to correct said conditions to be done, and
the city may take action against the land disturbance permit holder's security
to cover the cost of performing the work.
   C.   The city engineer may either reinstate or revoke any land disturbance
permit that has been suspended. (Ord. 2012-18, 12-4-2012)
16.44.730: RIGHT OF ENTRY:
In the administration and enforcement of this chapter, any duly authorized
official or employee of the city shall have authority to enter upon the
premises of the permitted site for the purposes of investigation and
inspection; provided however, that such right of entry shall be exercised at
reasonable times. The land disturbance permit constitutes written authority for
entry by the city. No land disturbance permit holder shall refuse to allow such
inspection. In the case where the responsible person is not a land disturbance
permit holder, the enforcement authority is to provide twenty four (24) hours'
written notice of the intent to inspect, except in emergency situations or when
consent has been obtained of the owner and/or occupant of the site to be
inspected. The notice shall state that the property owner has the right to
refuse entry and that, in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be
made only upon issuance of a search warrant as allowed by law. (Ord. 2012-18,
12-4-2012)
16.44.740: APPEALS:
Any person aggrieved of a final determination of the city engineer in the
issuance, denial, suspension or revocation of a land disturbance permit may
appeal such decision of the city engineer to the city manager by filing a
written appeal with the city recorder within thirty (30) days from the date of
the city engineer's decision. The city manager will give written notice to the
city engineer, the appellant, and all other persons requesting the same,
specifying the place, date, and time of hearing the appeal. (Ord. 2012-18, 12-
4-2012)
16.44.750: LIABILITY:
Neither issuance of grading approval under the provisions of this chapter, nor
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or with any conditions imposed
in a land disturbance permit issued under the provisions of this chapter, is to
relieve any person from responsibility for damage to any person or property or
impose any liability upon the city for damage to any person or property. (Ord.
2012-18, 12-4-2012)
16.44.760: RIGHT TO STOP WORK:
Nothing herein is to be construed as indicating that the city cannot
immediately stop the work being performed if, in the opinion of the city
engineer, the damage being done is of such a nature that it requires immediate
cessation of the work. This could result in the bypassing of the normal
processes of notices and increasing levels of enforcement, which will typically
be followed. (Ord. 2012-18, 12-4-2012)

   A.   To comply with Utah Code Annotated section 19-4-113 requiring counties
to adopt a water source protection ordinance to protect groundwater sources of
public drinking water.
   B.   To protect, preserve, and maintain existing and potential public
drinking water sources to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of city
residents and visitors.
   C.   To establish and designate drinking water source protection zones and
groundwater recharge areas for all sources of public drinking water within city
boundaries.
   D.   To regulate land use within identified areas where groundwater is or
could be affected by the use. This shall be accomplished by the designation and
regulation of property uses and conditions within such zones or areas.
   E.   A notice to cease or an exemption issued under this chapter shall not
relieve the owner of the obligation to comply with any other applicable
federal, state, regional or local regulations, rules, ordinances or
requirements, nor shall said notice or exemption relieve any owner of any
liability for violation of such regulations, rules, ordinances or requirements.
   F.   This chapter presents an adequate degree of protection for regulatory
purposes; however, it does not ensure that drinking water sources will not be
subject to accidental or intentional contamination. This chapter shall not
create liability on the part of the city, or its officers or employees, for any
damages to the public water supplies from reliance on this chapter, nor any
administrative order made hereunder. (Ord. 2010-15, 7-20-2010)

shall be reviewed by a geologist or hydrogeologist who has demonstrated
expertise in the assessment of recharge rates at the developer's expense. The
developer's engineer must submit their findings and best management and
construction controls to be implemented during the land use period
(construction or land use) to the city. The developer and his/her engineer
shall be aware of the restricted and prohibited uses established in subsection
16.50.100D of this chapter. Any development that will result in a loss of the
beneficial use of groundwater or that may have an adverse or negative effect
upon local groundwater quality shall be rejected. Plans that are rejected may
be revised by the developer and his/her engineer and resubmitted to the city
for subsequent review.

amendments or revisions are adopted. Any prior provisions of City land use
ordinances which do not now conform to provisions of this title are declared
void. Any uses, structures or buildings which were conforming to previous
provisions of this title but do not now conform shall be nonconforming uses,
structures or buildings as regulated in this chapter. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.04.080: SEVERABILITY OF PARTS:
The various sections, paragraphs, sentences, phrases and clauses of this title

portion thereof, which is planned in or necessitated by the development and
that is rationally related to the development's impact on the City's
transportation system. Where a planned street abuts or traverses a property,
required yard spaces shall be measured from the proposed right-of-way lines of
the street. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.04.140: EFFECT OF PUBLIC USES:
If the required area, width, frontage or yard space of a lot is rendered
noncompliant as a result of acquisition of a portion of the lot for public use,
the lot shall be considered a legal lot for purposes of this title. No
construction or boundary change may be undertaken which will render these
requirements further noncompliant. New buildings, structures or site
improvements proposed for construction on such a lot shall meet all other
requirements of the zone in which it is located. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.04.150: PERMITS AND PLANS REQUIRED:

be built upon, the size and setbacks of existing and proposed buildings and
structures, adjacent buildings and structures and other information as required
by this title and as deemed necessary by the Building, Fire, Engineering and
Planning Departments. Where required, conditional use permits, site plans and/
or plats must be approved prior to permit issuance. An applicant is entitled to
approval of a land use application if the application conforms to the
requirements of the City's future land use plan map, zoning map, and this title
if a complete application is submitted and all fees have been paid, unless the
Land Use Authority, on the record, finds that a compelling, countervailing
public interest would be jeopardized by approving the application, or the City
has formally initiated proceedings to amend its ordinances in a manner that
would prohibit approval of the application as submitted. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-
2007; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
17.04.160: CONFORMANCE REQUIRED:
All licenses, permits, agreements and plans issued or approved by the City
shall comply with all requirements and standards of City ordinances. All

requirements. New utility services shall not be provided on any property which
has failed to comply with all requirements, plans and permits. (Ord. 2007-02,
1-16-2007)
17.04.170: CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY AND ZONING COMPLIANCE:
It shall be unlawful to use or occupy, or permit the use or occupancy of any
building or premises until a certificate of occupancy has been issued for the
premises and/or building by the City. It is unlawful to occupy or to allow the
occupancy of any building with uses which are not authorized under the original
certificate of occupancy. A new certificate of occupancy must be obtained if
the use of the building is intensified or changed to the extent that the
original certificate is no longer valid due to violations of occupancy and use
codes. A certificate of occupancy may not be issued until all conditions and
requirements of the pertinent conditional use permit, site plan and/or plat are
met. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.04.180: SHARED YARD SPACE:
No required yard or open space around a building or structure or on a lot or

17.04.190: PRESERVATION OF LOT SPACE:
No space needed to meet requirements for lot width, yard or open space, lot
area, building coverage, parking, landscaping, public street frontage or other
requirements of this title for a lot or building may be transferred, sold,
bequeathed, or leased apart from such lot or building unless other space is
provided which will achieve compliance. No land may be sold or transferred
which will result in a lot that does not comply with the provisions of this
title. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.04.200: FRONT AND REAR YARD MODIFICATION; DEVELOPED AREAS:
In residential subdivisions or developments which were approved with front and
rear yard requirements which are now nonconforming and which have dwellings on
more than seventy five percent (75%) of the lots or parcels within the
subdivision or development, the minimum front and rear yard requirements for
new construction shall be equal to the average of the front or rear yards for
the buildings within the subdivision or development. However, this section
shall not be interpreted to require a larger front or rear yard for new
construction than the minimum front and rear yard requirements of the zoning
district in which said subdivision or development is located. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-
16-2007)
17.04.210: CLEAR VISION AREAS:

are located in the clear vision zone shall be pruned to a height of at least
seven feet (7') above the established sidewalk or street elevation. (Ord. 2007-

17.04.220: BUILDING HEIGHT:
Heights of buildings, fences, signs and other structures shall be determined by
the current regulations of the International Building Code and the individual
zones and chapters of this title. All buildings shall be constructed with at
least one story above grade. Building height shall be measured from the average
finished ground elevation to the peak of a pitched roof or to the coping of a
flat roof and need not include structures extending above the roof not intended
for occupancy. The height of communications antennas shall be regulated by
provisions of chapter 17.112 of this title. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.04.230: TEMPORARY USES:
"Temporary uses" shall be defined as uses which do not exceed sixty (60) days
in duration and which do not require permanent structures or improvements which
are not already established with an approved permanent use. Such uses may
include, but are not limited to, shaved ice kiosks, Christmas tree lots,
fireworks stands, revivals and carnivals. A temporary use shall not cause or
create a nuisance or hazard and shall conform to all requirements of this
title. Uses which exceed sixty (60) days in duration or are not similar to
those listed above may only be authorized with a conditional use permit which
need not be renewed in the future; provided, that all conditions continue to be
met and no hazards or nuisances have been created as a result of the use. All

that nominee shall be appointed as the alternate member to the Planning
Commission by a majority vote of the City Council. The alternate member of the
Planning Commission shall attend the Planning Commission meetings and
participate in the proceedings, but shall not vote in the meetings unless at
least one voting member is not present for the meeting or if at least one
voting member is recused. Members of the Planning Commission shall be appointed
for the same term, or remainder of a term, as the term of the Mayor or member
of City Council who nominated him or her. The City Council may remove any
member of the Planning Commission for any reason by majority vote of the City
Council. Any vacancy occurring on the Planning Commission by reason of death,
resignation, removal, or disqualification shall promptly be filled by the City
Council for the unexpired term of such member, according to the nominating and
appointment procedure set forth herein. A member of the Planning Commission
whose term has expired shall continue to serve until a successor has been
appointed unless otherwise directed by the City Council. Each member of the
Planning Commission, including the alternate member, shall be paid fifty
dollars ($50.00) per day for attending each regular Planning Commission
meeting. Members of the Planning Commission shall be appointed, including
appointments to fill vacancies, and removed by resolution of the City Council.
   A.   Commission Organization And Meetings: At the first regular Planning
Commission meeting held in each calendar year, the members shall select from
their number a Chairperson and other such officers as they deem necessary in
carrying out the functions of the Planning Commission and shall adopt such
rules and regulations for the conduct of business before the Planning
Commission as they deem appropriate, which rules and regulations may be
modified and/or amended at any time by the Planning Commission at any of its
regular meetings. The City Council may remove, replace, or appoint the
Chairperson of the Planning Commission by a majority vote of the City Council.
Planning Commission meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson and
at such other times as the Planning Commission may determine in accordance with
the law. Planning Commission meetings shall be open to the public, unless
closed in accordance with law. Three (3) members of the Planning Commission
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of the
majority of those Planning Commission members in attendance, but no less than
three (3) members, shall be required to pass any motion before the Planning
Commission. Minutes shall be taken at the Planning Commission meetings and
minutes containing the official act and recommendations of the Planning
Commission shall constitute public records and shall be available for
inspection upon reasonable notice at reasonable times and places. Reports of
official acts of the Planning Commission shall be made in writing and shall
indicate how each member of the Planning Commission voted with respect to such
acts or recommendations as the Planning Commission may from time to time make.
(Ord. 2016-09, 3-15-2016)
   B.   Functions And Duties: It shall be the function and duty of the Planning
Commission, after holding public hearings, to make and adopt and certify to the
legislative body, a general plan for the physical development of the
Municipality, including the areas outside of its boundaries which, in the
commission's judgment, bear relation to the planning of the Municipality. Where
the plan involves territory outside the boundaries of the City, action shall be
taken with the concurrence of the County or other municipal legislative body
concerned. The general plan, with the accompanying maps, plats, charts and
descriptive and explanatory matter, shall show the Planning Commission's
recommendations for the said physical development, and may include, among other
things, the general location and extent of streets. The Planning Commission may
from time to time amend, extend or add to the plan or carry any part or subject
matter into greater detail. It shall be the function and the duty of the
Planning Commission and it shall have the power to make, adopt and certify to
the City Council a zoning plan, including the text of the land use ordinance
and maps representing the Planning Commission's recommendations for the
regulation by districts or zones of the location, height, bulk, number of
stories, size of building and other structures, the percentage of the lot which
may be occupied, the size of the yard, courts and other spaces, the density and
distribution of population and the use of buildings, structures and land for
trade, industry, residence, recreation, commercial business, or other purposes
from and after the time when a land use ordinance has been enacted by the City
Council and the official map has been recorded in the Office of the City
Recorder. No permit shall be issued by the building official or any building or
structure or part thereof on any land located within the boundaries of the
zoning map which would be in violation of the recommendations of the Planning
Commission as shown on such official map. Any person aggrieved by his or her
inability to obtain any permit may appeal to an Appeal and Variance Hearing
Officer. The foregoing list of functions and duties of the commission shall not
be construed as all inclusive and the Planning Commission shall have such
additional powers and duties as are duly authorized under the laws of the State
for Planning Commissions. (Ord. 2014-05, 2-2-2014; amd. Ord. 2016-19, 8-2-2016)
   C.   Changes And Amendments: Land use ordinances, except for those contained
in this chapter, including the maps, may from time to time be amended by the
City Council after giving ten (10) days' notice of a public hearing, but all
such proposed changes and amendments, except for those in this chapter shall
first be proposed by the Planning Commission or shall be submitted to that
commission for its consideration prior to action by the City Council. With
respect to any proposed amendments, the Planning Commission shall, within
thirty (30) days' time after which the proposed amendment is referred to such
commission, report its approval or disapproval or recommendations with regard
to such proposed amendment to the City Council. The Planning Commission may
request that the City Council grant an extension of time for an in depth study
of the proposed amendment that must show cause why such additional study is
necessary on making such request. Failure of the Planning Commission to submit
a report or to request an extension of time within the prescribed time shall be
deemed approval by the Planning Commission of such proposed change or
amendment. The City Council may adopt, reject or accept in part the
recommendations of the Planning Commission by a majority vote of the members of
the City Council. (Ord. 2014-05, 2-2-2014)
   D.   Street Plan: From and after the time when the Planning Commission shall
have adopted a major street plan, the City Council may establish an official
map of the whole or part of the Municipality theretofore existing and
established by law as public streets. Such official map may also show the
location of the lines of streets from plats of subdivisions which shall have
been approved by the Planning Commission. The City Council may make, from time
to time, other additions to or modifications of the official street extensions,
widenings, narrowings or vacations which have been accurately surveyed and
definitely located, provided that before taking any such action, the City
Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, and that such proposed addition to
or modification of the official map shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for its approval. In the event of Planning Commission disapproval,
such additions or modifications shall require a favorable vote of not less than
a majority of the membership of the City Council. The placing of any street or
street lines upon the official map shall not in and of itself constitute or be
deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street or taking or
accepting of any land for street purposes. In order to preserve the integrity
of the official map, no permit shall be issued for any kind of building or
structure or part thereof on any land located between the mapped lines of any
street as shown on the official map. Any person aggrieved by his inability to
obtain such permit may appeal to an Appeal and Variance Hearing Officer. (Ord.
2014-05, 2-2-2014; amd. Ord. 2016-19, 8-2-2016)
   E.   Subdivision Control: From and after the time when the Planning
Commission shall have adopted a major street plan and shall have certified the
same to the City Council, no plat of a subdivision of land lying within the
City shall be filed or recorded in the County Recorder's Office until it shall
have been submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission and such
approval entered in writing on the plat by the City Attorney, the City
Engineer, the Planning Director and the Mayor. The filing or recording of a
plat of a subdivision without such approval shall be void. The Planning
Commission shall prepare regulations covering the subdivision of land within
the City. The City Council shall hold a public hearing on the subdivision
regulations and thereafter may adopt said regulations for the City. Whoever
being the owner of or agent of the owner of land located in the subdivision
within any area of the City for which a major street plan has been adopted by
the Planning Commission and the City Council, except for land located in a
recorded subdivision, transfers and sells such land without first preparing a
subdivision plat and having such plat approved by the City and recorded in the
Office of the County Recorder, shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor for
each lot so transferred or sold; and the description by metes and bounds in the
instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or
transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties, except that
in subdivisions of less than ten (10) lots, land may be sold by metes and
bounds, without the necessity of recording of plat if all of the following
conditions are met: (Ord. 2014-05, 2-2-2014; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
      1.   The subdivision layout shall have been first approved in writing by
the Planning Commission;
      2.   The subdivision is not traversed by the map lines of a proposed
street as shown on the official map or maps of the City, and does not require
the dedication of any land for street or other public purposes; and (Ord. 2014-
05, 2-2-2014)
      3.   If the subdivision is located in a zoned area, each lot in the
subdivision meets the frontage, width, density and area requirements of the
land use ordinance or has been granted a variance from such requirements by an
Appeal and Variance Hearing Officer. The City may enjoin such transfer or sale
by action for injunction or may recover the said penalty by civil action. (Ord.
2014-05, 2-2-2014; amd. Ord. 2016-19, 8-2-2016)

Department that includes:
      1.   A completed application form provided by the Planning Department;
(Ord. 2016-19, 8-2-2016; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)

   F.   Standard Of Review:
      1.   Variance: A Hearing Officer may grant a variance from a land use
requirement only if:
         a.   Literal enforcement of the requirement would cause an
unreasonable hardship for the applicant that is not necessary to carry out the
general purpose of the land use ordinance;
         b.   There are special circumstances attached to the property that do
not generally apply to other properties in the same zone;
         c.   Granting the variance is essential to the enjoyment of a
substantial property right possessed by other property in the same zone;
         d.   The variance will not substantially affect the general plan and
will not be contrary to the public interest; and
         e.   The spirit of the land use ordinance is observed and substantial
justice done.
      2.   Determination Of Hardship: In determining whether or not enforcement
of the land use requirement would cause unreasonable hardship under subsection
F1a of this section, a Hearing Officer may not find an unreasonable hardship
unless the alleged hardship:
         a.   Is located on or associated with the property for which the
variance is sought; and
         b.   Comes from circumstances peculiar to the property, not from
conditions that are general to the neighborhood.
      3.   Self-Imposed Or Economic Hardship: In determining whether or not
enforcement of the land use requirement would cause unreasonable hardship under
subsection F1a of this section, a Hearing Officer may not find an unreasonable
hardship if the hardship is self-imposed or economic.
      4.   Determination Of Special Circumstances: In determining whether or
not there are special circumstances attached to the property under subsection
F2b of this section, a Hearing Officer may find that special circumstances
exist only if the special circumstances:
         a.   Relate to the hardship complained of; and
         b.   Deprive the property of privileges granted to other properties in
the same zone.
      5.   Additional Requirements: In granting a variance, a Hearing Officer
may impose additional requirements on the applicant that will:
         a.   Mitigate any harmful effects of the variance; or
         b.   Serve the purpose of the standard or requirement that is waived
or modified.
      6.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant bears the burden of proving that all
of the conditions justifying a variance have been met.
      7.   Prohibited: A Hearing Officer shall not grant:
         a.   A variance that is greater than the minimum variation necessary
to relieve the unreasonable hardship the applicant can demonstrate;
         b.   A temporary variance; or
         c.   A use variance.
   G.   Variance Provisions: Variances run with the land.
   H.   Judicial Review Of Hearing Officer's Decision: The City or any person
adversely affected by any Hearing Officer decision may appeal to the District
Court of competent jurisdiction by filing a plenary action for relief;
provided, petition for such relief is presented to the court within thirty (30)
days after the filing of such decision with the City Recorder.
   I.   Stay Of Decision: A Hearing Officer may stay his or her decision for
thirty (30) days or until the District Court decides any appeal of the Hearing
Officer's decision. (Ord. 2016-19, 8-2-2016)
17.16.030: LAND USE ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT:

shall enforce all of the provisions of this title. The Planning Director shall
inspect or cause to be inspected all buildings in course of construction,
alteration or repair, and any change in the use of land. If, in the course of

such construction, alteration or repair, or that any use or contemplated use of
land is in violation of the provisions of this title, he or she shall issue a
written stop order to the person responsible therefor, ordering and directing
such person to cease and desist such construction, alteration, repair or use.

      2.   Accessory uses that involve significant quantities of hazardous
materials.
   F.   Additional Notice: The purpose of the additional notice control measure
is to ensure that property owners are notified of uses and projects with a
greater likelihood for negative impacts on properties beyond the immediate
vicinity. Uses and projects requiring additional notice according to this
section shall provide notice to all property owners of record within six
hundred feet (600') of the boundary of the subject property for any statutorily
required public hearing, in addition to other noticing requirements of this
Code and State law. The additional notice requirement shall apply to the
following uses and projects:
      1.   Initial establishment of uses identified in the required impact
control measures table in this section.
      2.   New construction projects that exceed ten (10) acres.
   G.   Residential Protection Area:
      1.   The purpose of a residential protection area is to minimize the
impact of a use on existing residential areas that are planned to remain
residential and areas that are planned to become residential in the future. A
residential protection area minimizes impacts on residential areas by applying
additional restrictions to a use or prohibiting a use with the protection area
as outlined below.
      2.   A residential protection area is the area within a distance
prescribed by the required impact control measure table in subsection H of this
section. A residential protection area is measured from the boundary of a
residential land use designation into the adjoining non-residential land use
designation on the future land use map.
      3.   Uses or buildings that were compliant when initially established are
not nonconforming uses or buildings, according to the requirements of this
chapter, due to subsequent rezoning and development of a residential use within
the residential protection area.
      4.   Residential protection areas shall be applied according to the
following:
         a.   Prohibited: Uses are prohibited, except for associated parking or
open space, within the distance identified in the required impact control
measures table in this section.
         b.   Stadium/Theater/Auditorium: The residential protection area
identified in the required impact control measures table of this section may be
reduced to one hundred feet (100') when the activities associated with the use
are conducted within completely enclosed structures and the floor area of the
structure is less than one thousand (1,000) square feet.
         c.   Gas Station: Underground fuel storage tanks are prohibited within
the residential protection area for the gas station use as identified in the
required impact control measures table in this section. The following
exceptions to the residential protection area are allowed:
            (1)   The residential protection area is reduced to one hundred
feet (100') from the property line of properties with a residential land use
designation that do not have an existing residential dwelling unit.
            (2)   The residential protection area shall not apply to properties
located on the opposite side of a minor collector road or greater, as
classified by the City's master transportation plan, from the gas station use.
         d.   Aircraft Transportation: Aircraft transportation landing and
takeoff facilities shall be located no closer than one thousand feet (1,000')
from the property line of a residential zone, except for rotor craft used by
emergency services in temporary situations.
         e.   P-O Zone: Drive-through facilities are prohibited.

or City Council in conformance with the requirements of this section and other
pertinent laws and ordinances. Unless amended, revoked, or otherwise specified
by the Planning Commission or City Council, a conditional use permit shall be

of this Code, unless the proposed conditional use is temporary and/or does not
require building or permanent site improvements or alterations. (Ord. 2016-02,
4-19-2016)
   D.   Permit Application Review:
      1.   All documents required to be submitted with a conditional use
application shall be delivered to the Planning Department for review. The
Planning Department shall review each application for completeness and
conformance to this section, the general plan, and this Code.
      2.   The Planning Department may provide the application to other City
departments for review and comment as may be required by this Code, as
necessary for complete review of the application, or as necessary to identify
and understand the potential detrimental effects of the proposed conditional
use.
      3.   In addition to the application for a conditional use permit, the
Planning Department may require other information or studies to address
potential detrimental effects of the proposed conditional use that have been
reasonably anticipated by the City during its review of the application.
   E.   Notice And Public Hearing: After a complete and accurate conditional
use permit application has been submitted to and reviewed by the Planning
Department, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing. Notice of the
public hearing shall be given as required by the Utah Open and Public Meetings
Act and section
17.04.060, "Public Notices", of this title. (Ord. 2016-02, 4-19-2016; amd. Ord.
2019-01, 3-5-2019)
   F.   Planning Commission Review And Action:
      1.   The Planning Commission shall approve a conditional use permit
application if reasonable conditions are proposed, or can be imposed, to
mitigate the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of the proposed
conditional use in accordance with applicable standards.
      2.   The Planning Commission may deny a conditional use permit
application if the reasonably anticipated detrimental effects of a proposed
conditional use cannot be substantially mitigated by the proposal or the
imposition of reasonable conditions to achieve compliance with applicable
standards. (Ord. 2016-02, 4-19-2016)
   G.   Appeals:
      1.   The City or any person aggrieved by a final decision, determination,
or requirement of the Planning Commission regarding the approval, approval with
conditions, or denial of a conditional use permit application may appeal the
Planning Commission's final action to the City's Appeal and Variance Hearing
Officer pursuant to section
17.16.020.020, "Appeals", of this title. (Ord. 2018-26, 12-4-2018)
   H.   Timely Commencement:
      1.   The holder of a conditional use permit shall substantially comply
with all conditions of the permit and an approved site plan, if one is required
pursuant to subsection C of this section, within one year of final permit
approval by the Planning Commission or City Council. If an approved site plan
is required, substantial compliance shall include obtaining a current building
permit, paying all application and impact fees, and by completing the
foundation of at least one principal building. If an approved site plan is not
required, substantial compliance shall include obtaining a business license.
(Ord. 2016-02, 4-19-2016)
      2.   If a conditional use permit is to expire pursuant to subsection H1
of this section, a request for an extension may be filed with the Planning
Department not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date. The
Planning Commission may, after evaluating the permittee's progress in the
previous year and considering the recommendation of the Planning Department,
grant an extension for the conditional use permit of up to one additional year.
(Ord. 2016-02, 4-19-2016; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
         a.   Failure to request the extension in a timely manner shall cause a
conditional use permit to automatically expire without further notice.
         b.   The original conditional use permit shall remain valid until the
request for extension is acted upon by the Planning Commission.
         c.   Once a conditional use permit has expired, the permittee must
obtain approval of a new permit prior to any reinstatement of the use.
         d.   Only one extension may be granted.
      3.   If an approved conditional use ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of one year or more, the conditional use permit shall
automatically expire without further notice. Once a permit has expired, the
permittee must obtain approval of a new permit prior to any reinstatement of
the conditional use.
   I.   Compliance And Revocation:
      1.   A conditional use may be commenced and operated only upon:
         a.   Compliance with all conditions of an applicable conditional use
permit;
         b.   Observance of all requirements of this Code relating to
maintenance of improvements and conduct of the use or business as approved; and
         c.   Compliance with all applicable local, State, and Federal laws.
      2.   A conditional use permit may be revoked by the City Council at any
time due to the permittee's failure to commence or operate the conditional use
in accordance with the requirements of subsection I1 of this section.
      3.   No conditional use permit shall be revoked until after a public
hearing is held before the City Council. The permittee shall be notified in
writing of such hearing. The notification shall state the grounds for
complaint, or reasons for revocation, and the time and location of the hearing.
At the hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be heard and may
call witnesses and present evidence on his or her behalf. Upon conclusion of
the hearing, the City Council shall determine whether or not the permit should
be revoked. (Ord. 2016-02, 4-19-2016)

The Redwood Road mixed use (MU) zones are established to implement the land use
element of the general plan and the Redwood Road centers map, as amended, which
is included for reference in this chapter. The purpose of the MU zones is to
establish unique and distinct districts in a succession of nodes along the
Redwood Road corridor. These districts are defined by separate classes of uses
and development standards which identify the character of the individual
districts. The allowed uses and standards applicable to each district are set
forth in this chapter and are intended to create a distinctive identity
representative of the City's quality of life. The MU zones will encourage
orderly, aesthetically pleasing development and a balance of uses while
discouraging strip commercial with its attendant congestion, pollution and

This chapter is established to provide standards and regulations, consistent
with the city's general plan and the purposes and provisions of this title, for
commercial areas in the city. This chapter shall apply to the following
commercial zones established in chapter 17.20, "Zone Establishment", of this
title: C-N, C-C, and C-F zones. Uses may only be conducted in commercial zones
in accordance with the regulations of this code. Allowed use (permitted and
conditional), accessory use, temporary use, and other associated use
regulations are found in chapter 17.18, "Uses", of this title.
   A.   C-N Zone: The purpose of the C-N zone is to provide areas where small
scale commercial retail and service uses may be located to accommodate the
daily needs of local residents and passing motorists. Uses should be
harmoniously integrated with surrounding neighborhoods and impose minimal
detriment resulting from traffic, lighting, noise, or other negative effects.
   B.   C-C Zone: The purpose of the C-C zone is to provide areas for large
scale community or regional retail and service uses. These areas will generally
be located near major transportation hubs but should be designed to buffer
neighboring residential areas. Coordinated circulation, architecture and
landscaping and a balance of uses should be incorporated in developments.
   C.   C-F Zone: The purpose of the C-F zone is to provide areas along the
interstate freeway for major commercial uses that are both compatible with and
dependent on freeway visibility and access. Developments should be generally
upscale with attention given to coordination of traffic circulation and
building placement. Developments should provide a pleasing and functional
environment that represents the quality of life in the city and also enhances
employment opportunities and the retail tax base of the city. (Ord. 2015-09,

17.70.010: PURPOSE:
The Bangerter Highway mixed use zone may be cited as the "BH-MU zone" and may
be established along the east side of Bangerter Highway to provide areas for
higher density, mixed use development. Such development will be compatible with
a major arterial highway corridor and should discourage low density single-
family residential development near the highway.
It is intended that a variety of retail, office, entertainment and residential
uses be combined to create a self-contained environment for workers, shoppers,
residents and visitors in a pedestrian oriented unified manner while
accommodating automobile traffic to regional services dependent upon a major
transportation facility.
The BH-MU zone will encourage orderly, aesthetically pleasing development and a
balance of uses while discouraging strip commercial with its attendant
congestion, pollution and visual blight. Buildings shall be designed to have
architectural and access orientation to the street. (Ord. 2010-04, 5-18-2010)
17.70.020: ZONE ESTABLISHMENT:
Each proposed BH-MU zone shall be contiguous to the Bangerter Highway right of
way. Each proposed BH-MU zone shall be accompanied by a master development plan
("MDP") which specifies land use areas and residential densities including the
total number of residential units. Retail, office, residential, mixed use, open
space and public/quasi-public land use areas will be shown on the MDP. The MDP
shall be adopted as an exhibit to the ordinance establishing the BH-MU zone in
which it is proposed. The MDP shall be adopted by the city council after the
establishment of the BH-MU zone by following standard rezoning procedures of
chapter 17.22 of this title. The city council shall review and may approve
necessary amendments to the MDP based upon appropriate changes to the land use
mix and market conditions. (Ord. 2010-04, 5-18-2010; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-

17.72.010: PURPOSE:
   A.   The Planned Community (P-C) Zone is established to promote the
following:
      1.   High quality, innovative and creative development that includes a
mixture of uses, heights and setbacks, varying densities and lot sizes and
sufficient diversity of housing types to meet the full life cycle of housing
needs of City residents.
      2.   Preservation of open space.
      3.   Retail, employment and recreational uses that meet or exceed the
needs of the residents of the P-C Zone.
      4.   A pedestrian environment which encourages transit and bicycle usage.
      5.   A desirable living and working environment with unique identity and
character.
   B.   The P-C Zone will be designed to include neighborhoods, villages,
towns, business and research parkways and open space with convenient pedestrian
access among residential, commercial, office, retail and recreational areas.
Individual structures within neighborhoods, villages, towns, and business and
research parkways may contain mixed uses. Permitted densities and intensity of
land use in villages and towns may be higher than those permitted in
neighborhoods. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.72.020: LAND USE DESIGNATIONS:
All land use designations, adopted or amended, are incorporated in this Code
and referenced in the City Recorder's Office or on file with the City Recorder.
The P-C Zone shall consist of the following land uses, which shall be
identified in the community structure plan as provided in this chapter. Land
uses so identified are described in the land use element of the general plan.
Various uses proposed in the P-C Zone may only be established in conformance
with provisions of this chapter.
   A.   Neighborhood: This category is designed for comparatively low density
mixed use development that emphasizes residential (single- and multi-family)
use, but also includes office, commercial, industrial, public/semipublic and
recreation/open space uses. This category may accommodate gross residential
density of five (5) units per acre.
   B.   Village: This category is designed for medium density mixed use
development that includes residential (single- and multi- family), office,
commercial, industrial, public/semipublic and recreation/open space uses,
without a predetermined emphasis on any single use. This category may
accommodate gross residential density of twenty five (25) units per acre.
   C.   Town: This category is designed for high density mixed use development
that emphasizes office, commercial and recreational uses, but also includes
residential (single- and multi-family), public/semipublic, industrial and open
space uses. This category may accommodate gross residential density of fifty
(50) units per acre.
   D.   Business And Research Parkway: This category is designed to accommodate
(but not require) a mixture of all uses: residential (single- and multi-
family), office, commercial, industrial, recreational and public/semipublic
uses. The principal land use in this category should be office, commercial and
industrial.
   E.   Open Space: Landscaped or natural area or farmland which is established
to provide and preserve outdoor recreational, agricultural or other similar
uses. (Ord. 2007-04, 5-15-2007)
17.72.030: PERMITTED USES:
The following uses may be conducted anywhere within the P-C Zone:
Daycare facilities.
Healthcare facilities.
Home based occupations according to title 5, chapter 5.38 of this Code.
Industrial and manufacturing uses.
Mix of permitted uses (including, without limitation, office/commercial,
office/residential, retail/residential) within individual structures.
Open space, including landscaped areas and areas in natural vegetation, golf
courses, parks, recreational areas.
Public facilities, such as schools, playgrounds and trails.
Religious activities.
Residential uses of all types on a range of lot sizes including, without
limitation, single-family detached; single-family attached; multi-family
residential; townhomes; loft apartments; residential units above ground floor
retail, commercial or office uses and condominiums.
Retail, service, office, hotel, restaurant, entertainment and all other
commercial uses of any type except as otherwise identified in this chapter as a
conditional or prohibited use.
Other accessory uses which are ancillary to, and designed to serve, any of the
foregoing uses. (Ord. 2014-10, 6-3-2014)
17.72.040: CONDITIONAL USES:
A conditional use permit may be issued for the following uses in the P-C Zone:
Pawnbrokers, secondhand merchandise dealers, secondary metals dealers and
recyclers and similar businesses. (Ord. 2014-10, 6-3-2014)
17.72.045: CREATION OR APPROVAL OF P-C ZONE PLANS OR PLATS:
Each developer requesting the creation of a P-C Zone or approval of a P-C Zone
plan, community structure plan, master subdivision plat or project plan/
preliminary subdivision plat may propose, in the applicable P-C Zone plan,
community structure plan, master subdivision plat or project plan/preliminary
subdivision plat, the inclusion of: a) land use categories in addition to those
set forth in section
17.72.020 of this chapter; b) specific uses within each land use category in
addition to the permitted uses set forth in section
17.72.030 of this chapter; and c) land uses that the Planning Director deems to
be substantially or materially inconsistent with the purpose and function of
the P-C Zone and the land use categories as described in this chapter and in
the land use element of the general plan. Such decisions of the Planning
Director can be appealed to the City Council. The inclusion of any proposed
additional land use category or any additional permitted use must be approved
by the City Council as a conditional use. Design standards for such conditional
use shall be included in the applicable master subdivision plat or project
plan/preliminary subdivision plat. (Ord. 2014-10, 6-3-2014; amd. Ord. 2019-01,
3-5-2019)
17.72.050: USE REGULATIONS:
Uses may be conducted in the P-C Zone only in accordance with the following
regulations:
   A.   Only permitted, conditional or accessory uses as set forth in this
chapter may be conducted in the P-C Zone. A conditional use permit must be
obtained prior to the establishment of a conditional use. Sexually oriented
businesses are prohibited in the P-C Zone.
   B.   All uses in the P-C Zone shall be conducted within fully enclosed
buildings, except those uses customarily conducted in the outdoors, including
outdoor eating establishments, Christmas tree lots, golf courses, gardens,
nurseries and parks.
   C.   Accessory uses may be conducted in the P-C Zone only in conjunction
with allowed permitted and conditional uses. Accessory uses include, but are
not limited to, caretakers, nurses, nannies, maids, home occupations,
recreational facilities, swimming pools, gardens, garages, sheds, parking lots
and terraces, properly screened utility and loading areas, satellite dishes and
other structures and activities which are incidental and subordinate to the
principal permitted or conditional use on the premises.
   D.   There shall be no open storage of trash, debris, used materials or
commercial goods or wrecked or neglected materials, equipment or vehicles in
the P-C Zone. No commercial materials, inventory or equipment may be stored in
the open, except as otherwise approved by this chapter or by the City Council.
   E.   It shall be unlawful to park, store or leave, or to permit the parking,
storing or leaving of any vehicle of any kind, or parts thereof, which is in a
wrecked, junked, dismantled, inoperative or abandoned condition, whether
attended or not, upon any private or public property within the P-C Zone for
longer than seventy two (72) hours, except that up to two (2) such vehicles or
parts thereof may be stored completely within an enclosed building.
   F.   No commercial vehicle or commercial earthmoving or material handling
equipment shall be parked or stored on any lot or parcel in the P-C Zone,
except in conjunction with temporary development or construction activities on
the lot. Commercial vehicles shall include semitrucks and trailers, trucks and
trailers equaling or exceeding eight thousand (8,000) pounds' curb weight,
delivery vehicles, dump trucks, backhoes, graders, loaders, farm implements,
cement trucks, bulldozers, belly dumps and scrapers, forklifts or any similar
vehicle or apparatus.
   G.   Watercraft, trailers, campers, motor homes and other utility or
recreational vehicles shall be stored within completely enclosed, lawfully
constructed buildings or within opaque fence enclosures at least six feet (6')
behind the front line and the street side line of the main building on the lot
or parcel in a P-C Zone, except that said vehicles may be stored temporarily in
front or side yards for no longer than twenty four (24) hours. Travel trailers,
campers and motor homes may not be occupied as living quarters in the P-C Zone,
except that a vehicle owned by a guest of the resident may be stored and
occupied in the required front yard or side yard of the permanent dwelling for
no more than seven (7) days per calendar year. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.72.060: ZONE AREA:
Each Planned Community Zone shall contain a minimum of five hundred (500)
acres. If the P-C Zone contains multiple owners, the owners may, if necessary
to reach the five hundred (500) acre threshold, or if such owners otherwise
desire, combine their properties for planning and development purposes. (Ord.
2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.72.070: PLANNING AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR P-C ZONE:
Development within the P-C Zone will require a series of plans to be prepared
and submitted for approval. The purpose of this process is to clearly establish
the development plans for property within P-C Zones while recognizing the large
scale nature of the development and the need for integrated planning. The first
step is the preparation and approval of a P-C Zone plan that establishes the
development program for the P-C Zone and, upon approval, vests the entitlement
to build up to the number of dwelling units and up to the square footage of
nonresidential uses reflected in the P-C Zone plan. The second step is the
creation and approval of the community structure plan that establishes the
major infrastructure systems, the unifying systems for the development such as
open space and transportation corridors, and provides locations of the more
specific land uses (neighborhoods, villages, towns and business and research
parkways). The third step is a recorded master subdivision plat that provides
more detailed information regarding the proposed development of a multi-phased
portion of the property and, when recorded, subdivides portions of the property
into logical development units. Prior to commencing development, the developer
must submit a project plan/preliminary subdivision plat providing sufficient
detail for the creation of lots, dedication of roads, layout of specific land
uses and the engineering of requisite infrastructure and a final subdivision
plat. If the project includes condominiums, a condominium map is required as
per State law. (Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)

(Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
Development within a P-C Zone will also be governed by design guidelines. This
chapter provides for at least two (2) levels of design guidelines to be
prepared and recorded as covenants that will establish the design standards for
public and private improvements. At the time that the master subdivision plat
is approved, guidelines that govern the design and maintenance of major public
infrastructure improvements (including, without limitation, sidewalks, street
lighting, paving, street furniture, etc.), and general building placement,
massing and design criteria will be recorded. The second set of guidelines will
be created at the time of the project plan/preliminary subdivision plat
application. These guidelines will establish in much greater detail the
character and nature of the design of public and private improvements within
the area covered by the project plan/preliminary subdivision plat. The project
plan/preliminary subdivision plat will be a fully integrated development plan
and may simultaneously address subdivision, site plan and condominium mapping
considerations. If all of these considerations are addressed, this case, the
design guidelines shall meet the design guideline requirements of site plans,
subdivisions and condominium maps. The design guidelines developed for the
final project plan/subdivision plat shall be consistent with those submitted at
the project plan/preliminary subdivision plat stage as such submittals may be
modified based on the comments of City staff. To the extent that any portion of
the development is not covered by the final project plan/subdivision plat,
design guidelines may be prepared and presented for approval as part of
individual subdivision plat, condominium map or site plan applications.
In acting on requests for approval of a P-C Zone plan, community structure
plan, master subdivision plat, project plan/preliminary subdivision plat, or
final subdivision plat (including the site plan or condominium map components,
if applicable), neither City staff, the Planning Commission nor the City
Council shall be bound by limitations on density or intensity of use, use
restrictions and limitations, design standards or similar limitations on
development or construction contained in other portions of this title.
Decisions with respect to such matters (including, without limitation,
appropriate densities and intensity of use) will be made by the City staff,
Planning Commission and City Council, as applicable, in connection with each
request for approval of a P-C Zone plan, community structure plan, master
subdivision plat, project plan/preliminary subdivision plat, or final
subdivision plat (including the site plan or condominium map components, if
applicable), taking into account the purpose of the P-C Zone and the densities,
intensity of use, uses and mix of uses permitted herein. In addition, in the
event of any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and other portions
of this title, the provisions of this chapter shall control. Neither the City
staff, the Planning Commission nor the City Council shall have the discretion
to disapprove a P-C plan, community structure plan, master subdivision plat or
final subdivision plat (including the site plan or condominium map components,
if applicable) on the basis of types of uses proposed, mixture of uses,
location of uses, densities or intensities of use so long as the proposed uses,
densities and intensities of use are permitted under this chapter. (Ord. 2007-
02, 1-16-2007)
17.72.080: P-C ZONE PLAN:
   A.   The P-C Zone may only be established in an area designated as "large

CHAPTER 17.73
VILLAGE MIXED RESIDENTIAL (VMR) ZONE
(Rep. by Ord. 2014-06, 3-4-2014)
CHAPTER 17.74
MIXED USE (MU) ZONE
SECTION:
17.74.010: Objectives And Characteristics Of Zone
17.74.020: Zone Establishment
17.74.030: Development Review
17.74.040: Special Provisions
17.74.050: Area Requirements
17.74.060: Development Standards Applicable To Mixed Use (MU) Zones/
Subdistricts
17.74.010: OBJECTIVES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ZONE:
The Mixed Use (MU) Zone is established to provide a zone to be used in specific
locations near City transportation nodes and corridors with the intent of
allowing a mix of specific land uses that are typically found separately in
"mutually exclusive" zoning districts. Mixed use represents a departure from
characteristic zoning to the extent that it encourages a combination of land
uses which may be compatible, but have traditionally been separated.
The intent of this zone is to create self-sustaining developments that become
walkable areas that provide convenient pedestrian access to mass transit,
commercial services and employment opportunities. Proposed developments shall
include design standards that incorporate "walkable" elements, such as a mix of
uses, "build-to" lines, compact building design, preservation of open space,
pedestrian friendly streets, streetscape, parking concealment, architectural
control, and maintenance.
   A.   MU-TOD Subdistrict: The purpose of this subdistrict is to encourage the
development of high intensity regional mixed land uses with maximum building
height and bulk standards conducive to transit oriented development. The focus
of such uses would be in appropriate areas along Jordan Gateway and I-15 in
proximity to the FrontRunner Commuter Rail Station.
   B.   MU-TC Subdistrict: The purpose of this subdistrict is to encourage the
development of medium intensity community and town center mixed uses that are
built at a human scale, and are pedestrian friendly and architecturally
diverse. The location of such uses would be in appropriate areas along portions
of Redwood Road and South Jordan Parkway, with a focus on the area around City
Hall and the South Jordan Towne Plaza. (Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
17.74.020: ZONE ESTABLISHMENT:
   A.   Each proposed MU Zone, or subdistrict thereof, may be established by
following standard rezoning procedures of
chapter 17.22 of this title and shall be accompanied by a master development
plan (MDP) prepared by the applicant, in consultation with City staff and area
property owners, which specifies land use areas. Retail, office, vertical mixed
use (containing different upper floor uses), open space and public/quasi-public
land use areas will be shown on the MDP. The MDP must show all stages of the
development (including any phasing plans), street connections, and both
existing and reasonable projected development on adjoining properties,
determined as needed. Phased developments and approved individual plats and
site plans shall conform to the master development plan. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-
2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
   B.   The intent of the above is to achieve a consistent overall mixed use
neighborhood with uniform and compatible site standards when the project area
is completely built out. Remnant parcels left from old developments, rebuilds
on existing parcels, or pads within existing center developments, are required
to make reasonable compliance with mixed use development standards through
consultation with the Planning Director. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord.
2017-05, 3-7-2017; Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
   C.   The MDP shall be adopted as an exhibit to the ordinance establishing
the MU Zone subdistrict, in which it is proposed. The MDP, or portions thereof,
may be amended only after review by the Planning Commission and upon approval
of the City Council with public input after the establishment of the MU Zone,
as may be needed. A development agreement between the City and the applicant
may be required by the City Council and executed before the zoning designation
shall be effective. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
17.74.030: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW:
All development and uses in MU zones may only be established in conformance
with development review procedures of the city as set forth in title 16,
chapter 16.24 of this code and in conformance with the approved master
development plan (MDP), or as the plan may be amended and approved.
Applicants shall follow the procedures and requirements of this code regarding
development review in the preparation and review of development proposals in MU
zones. All uses shall be conducted according to the approved plan or plat and
any conditions of approval. Applicants are encouraged to consult with city
staff and/or the development review committee (DRC) prior to submitting a site
plan application. The following procedure shall be used for site plan review of
projects in the MU zone:
   A.   The developer shall prepare and submit a site plan and submit a design
book containing typical renderings, cross sections, and plan views of the
following:
      1.   Existing and proposed public street curb, gutter, sidewalk, park
strip, landscaping, streetlights and pavement.
      2.   Yard areas between buildings and public streets, including trees,
grass, shrubs, ground cover, signs and screen walls.
      3.   Parking areas, walkways, driveways, landscaped areas and storm
detention/retention areas.
      4.   Architectural features, including materials and colors, of
buildings, freestanding and wall mounted signs and light fixtures, trash
enclosures, utility and loading area screen walls, pedestrian furniture and
artwork.
      5.   Other improvements as required by city staff.
   B.   The city staff shall review the site plan and design book for
compliance with the master development plan and shall provide comments to the
developer for needed revisions to the documents. Upon final review and approval
of city staff, the site plan and design book for the development will be
scheduled on the planning commission agenda for a public hearing.
   C.   Upon approval of the site plan and design book by the planning
commission, the subdivision or condominium plats for all or portions of the MU
zone may be prepared and submitted in accordance with title 16,
chapter 16.10 of this code and other applicable sections of title 16,
"Subdivision And Development Code", of this code.
   D.   Building permits shall only be approved upon prior approval of the site
plan, design book, and, if necessary, the subdivision or condominium plat
(including improvements). (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
17.74.040: SPECIAL PROVISIONS:
When reviewing a proposed development in the MU zone, the planning commission
shall consider the following special provisions in order to protect the
intended characteristics of the zone:
   A.   Location: Mixed use developments shall be located at transportation
nodes and along transportation corridors and other locations where "walkable"
components (i.e., convenience commercial, employment, community facilities,
transportation linkages, park or other open space, schools, churches) are
already present, planned, or where the size and scale of development is such
that said components can be provided within the project itself. As a guiding
principle, mixed use components should be within a five (5) minute (or 1/
4 mile) walking distance, approximately one-fourth (1/4) mile, of the above.
   B.   Traffic: The developer shall demonstrate that all potential traffic
concerns regarding existing intersections, substandard streets, inadequate
improvements, and access are mitigated.
   C.   Surrounding Properties: The developer shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the planning commission, that sufficient measures have been
incorporated into the development plan to assure that adjacent properties will
not experience significant impacts as a result of the proposed development.
   D.   Use Composition: Each MU zone shall contain a combination of more than
one use. The actual blend of "vertical" and/or "horizontal" mixed use
development shall be determined depending upon the size, scale, and location of
the development.
   E.   Pedestrian Realm: In order to achieve an overall "walkable"
development, appropriate land uses, pedestrian connections, cross easements,
common driveways, consistent site standards, etc., must be coordinated within
the respective MU zone subdistrict, even though properties may be individually
owned. In order to promote pedestrian activity and to improve air quality,
drive- through windows are discouraged in conjunction with uses such as fast
food restaurants, dry cleaners, banks, etc. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord.
2017-05, 3-7-2017)
17.74.050: AREA REQUIREMENTS:
The following area requirements shall apply in any MU zone:
   A.   Minimum Zone Area: The minimum area of an MU zone/MDP shall be four (4)
acres.
   B.   Minimum Project Area: Any development in any MU zone for which a
preliminary plat or site plan has been proposed or approved. The minimum area
of any project within an MU zoned area shall be two (2) acres. Approved
projects may be built in phases based upon an overall approved phasing plan.
   C.   Minimum Lot Area: There shall be no minimum lot area in any MU zone,
except as established with development approval. Parcels shall be of sufficient
size to assure compliance with building setbacks, landscaping, access, parking,
and walkability standards. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-
2017)
17.74.060: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO MIXED USE (MU) ZONES/
SUBDISTRICTS:
The following standards are to be considered as applying specifically to
development in mixed use (MU) subdistricts in addition to general standards
provided elsewhere in this code:
   A.   Building Placement And Massing:
      1.   Setbacks: Building facades shall comprise at least seventy percent
(70%) of each street edge identified as "build-to lines". To meet this
requirement, building facades adjacent to streets must be zero feet (0') to
five feet (5') from the street side (typically inside edge of sidewalk)
property lines where build-to lines are drawn. Awnings and architectural
features may project beyond build-to lines, as approved by the planning
commission. Street side setback variations may be used when an activity related
to pedestrian use is maintained, i.e., special landscaping, outside restaurant
seating. Recessed plazas, courtyards, and trellises are encouraged.
      Zero lot line side setbacks with attached structures, in compliance with
the international building code (IBC) may be required except for necessary
driveway access, pedestrian access, open space, and landscape areas. Unless
otherwise approved by the planning commission, rear yards and the rear of
buildings shall not directly abut streets.
      2.   Building Orientation And Access: The entrances of all retail, civic,
and office buildings shall front onto streets (or approved private driveways
designed as streets), with the exception of anchor stores greater than forty
thousand (40,000) square feet in size, which may be considered for "side
fronting" design.

Secondary entries are encouraged and may be required at the rear of street
facing buildings. Where possible, "like land uses" shall face "like land uses"
or open space, i.e., retail across the street from retail, etc. Loading docks
and service areas must be screened from streets and adjacent properties through
architectural design and landscaping. Anchor store entrances must be connected
to adjacent streets via landscaped, publicly accessible walkways. Access from
parking areas may be via midblock passageways or "paseos" connected to the
street. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
      3.   Building Height: Buildings shall have a minimum and maximum number
of stories as indicated by building type and mixed use subdistrict in the table
below, with height measured according to the city's adopted ordinances and
standards. The planning commission may approve greater building heights than
shown in the table below if it identifies site or design characteristics that
are unique to the development such as size, scale, topography, or development
amenities (e.g., rooftop gardens), that justify allowing greater building
heights. Approved structures with additional height may be required to employ
suitable "step back" architecture and other architectural features that create
a development that is built at the human scale, and is pedestrian friendly and
architecturally diverse.

Notes:
   1.    Vertical architectural elements that make the buildings appear greater
than 1 story.
   2.       "Step back" architecture may be required so that building heights
adjacent to public streets are limited to enhance pedestrian design.
(Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
      4.   CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design): Where
practically possible, CPTED principles shall be used in the design and layout
of buildings, streets, accesses and open space areas. Design shall promote
natural surveillance, access control, territorial reinforcement, sense of
ownership, proper management and maintenance. CPTED landscaping guidelines
shall be used, including planting shrubs with a maximum height of two feet (2')
to three feet (3') and trees with a proper ground clearance of six feet (6') to
eight feet (8') above walkways and sidewalks and eight feet (8') to ten feet
(10') above vehicular travel and parking lanes.
In order to encourage public safety through natural surveillance, natural
access control, and territorial reinforcement, blank walls are not permitted
adjacent to streets, pedestrian corridors, parking areas, and open space
amenities. Symbolic barriers, such as low lying fences/wall, landscaping and
signage may be used, as appropriate, to discourage crime and to promote safety
through natural access control. Developments shall have street side building
entrances and extensive windows, with balconies, decks or landscape terraces,
and other architectural features being encouraged to promote "eyes on the
street".
   B.   Land Use Impact And Buffering: Landscape buffers are preferred over
fences and walls where separation is desirable. A visually open look is
encouraged between compatible uses. The planning commission may require special
treatment of such areas. Fences or walls, if determined to be necessary or
desirable, must be reviewed for their effectiveness in protecting private space
while not creating isolated uses or dead space void of natural surveillance.
When approved, fences or walls shall be compatible in color, texture, and
design in relationship to building materials.
   C.   Architectural Design And Materials: The treatment of building mass,
materials and exterior appurtenances shall create an aesthetically pleasing
building and site that is in character with and in proportion to other
surrounding buildings, while still providing diversity in design. The city's
architectural review committee (ARC) shall review such and make recommendations
to the planning commission. Requirements applicable to all buildings are stated
below:
      1.   All sides of buildings shall receive equal design consideration,
particularly where exposed to pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic and adjacent
properties.
      2.   Building materials for structures, including garages, shall use
brick, stone, or cement fiber products (i.e., hardie board) in combinations
that create aesthetically pleasing architecture. Stucco products, if used,
shall clearly be used in minimal amounts and as a contrast or accent to other
building materials, i.e., gables. Both vertical and horizontal elements should
be used, as appropriate, to enrich and give variety to the architectural theme.
Individual buildings shall have enough architectural variation to appear as
separately recognizable structures. The use of exposed concrete (architectural
concrete excepted), or plastic for storefront facades is not permitted.
      3.   A consistent architectural theme with colors from the natural
environment is encouraged to help buildings blend with surrounding
developments. Building styles shall be compatible with existing buildings
within the respective MU zone.
      4.   Buildings shall be designed to relate to grade conditions with a
minimum of grading and exposed foundation walls, creating easy pedestrian
access from sidewalks, parking areas, etc. Commercial or mixed use buildings
shall be designed with contrasting ground floor architectural articulation in
order to enhance street activity and walkability. All buildings shall have
expansive windows, balconies, terraces, or other design features which are
oriented to the street, or other people spaces, in order to maximize interface
connection. Windows, display windows, doors, and arcades must make up at least
seventy percent (70%) of street facing facades on the first story of commercial
developments. Window shapes and sizes shall be so designed to be compatible
from building to building. Tinted windows or windows with reflective film or
glass are not permitted at street level.

(Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
      5.   Mechanical equipment shall be located or screened so as not to be
visible from streets, pedestrian areas, and adjacent developments. Screens
shall be aesthetically incorporated into the design of the building whether
located on the ground or on the roof. Exterior trash receptacles shall be
enclosed by masonry walls that are at least as tall as the top of the
receptacle itself, but not less than six feet (6') tall, and solid steel access
doors. The color of trash receptacle enclosures (masonry walls and access
doors) shall be consistent with colors used in the associated buildings. (Ord.
2017-22, 7-18-2017)
      6.   Plans for significant exterior modifications to any existing
structures must be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval and must
meet the same requirements as all other structures within the MU development.
   D.   Signage: Proper design and placement of signs and their lighting shall
be compatible with structures and uses. Mixed use developments shall have a
sign theme which promotes mixed use compatibility. Permitted signs within the
MU Zone shall be in compliance with title 16, chapter 16.36 of this Code,
except that freestanding and off premises signs or billboards shall not be
permitted. Wall signs, blade signs, and window signs, approved as part of an
overall sign theme, are encouraged. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05,
3-7-2017)
Monument signs and directional signs are discouraged. Where approved, a
monument sign must comply with the following limitations: The sign shall have
as the prominent feature the name of the development (i.e., "Jordan Village",
"Jordan Plaza"). All other lettering shall be no taller than four inches (4")
in height. The maximum height of the sign shall be four feet (4') for the
portion containing general copy, with an overall maximum height of six feet
(6') above sidewalk grade. It is intended that the top two feet (2') be
utilized to identify the name of the development. The lettering font style for
tenant identification shall be the same for all tenants. Monument signs shall
be constructed with the materials similar to that of the main building.
Monument signs may not extend into the required sight visibility triangle,
unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd.
Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017; Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
   E.   Open Space: Significant usable open space shall be provided within the
mixed use development, depending upon size, scale, nature, and proximity of
other accessible open space amenities in the area of the development. Approved
open space may include, but is not limited to: commons, pocket parks, plazas,
outdoor dining, courtyards, natural or manmade landscape features or focal
points, fountains, waterfalls, other water features, greenbelts, trail
connections, playgrounds, pavilions, and picnic areas. A "village green", as a
commons area, may be required adjacent to mass transit connections or other
significant activity.
Construction materials used within open space areas shall be related to the
materials of adjacent buildings and shall be a nonskid finish. Design and
texture shall encourage comfortable and safe pedestrian use, including
landscaping, seating areas, and lighting as appropriate.
Areas of environmental concern or interest may be required to be preserved,
i.e., drainages, steep slopes, connections to trail systems, and water
features. Unless otherwise specified through special agreement or understanding
with the City, all open space areas shall be maintained by property owners or
property associations.
   F.   Landscaping: Landscaping guidelines are established to improve and
maintain site qualities while minimizing alteration, removal, or degradation of
approved landscaping. Landscaping, in general, shall follow CPTED (crime
prevention through environmental design) principles.
      1.   Submittal Of Landscape And Streetscape Plans: No plans for any
building, structure or other improvements shall be approved by the City unless
there shall also have been submitted landscape and streetscape plans
satisfactory to the Planning Commission or to the staff, if so designated.
      2.   Installation At Time Of Occupancy: Landscaping in accordance with
the plans submitted must be installed at the time of occupancy or as otherwise
approved by the planning staff as seasonal conditions may dictate.
      3.   Condition Free Of Weeds: Future development areas or land area not
occupied by buildings, structures, hard surfacing, vehicular driveways or
pedestrian walkways shall be kept in a weed free condition or landscaped, as
approved by the Planning Commission.
      4.   Bond For Landscape Improvements: The developer shall bond for
landscape improvements to ensure that installations are completed as submitted
and approved. Performance assurance requirements for landscape improvements
shall be the same as required by the City for street improvements.
      5.   Planting Specifications:
         a.   Sixty percent (60%) medium size trees; deciduous trees with a
caliper of two inches (2") and evergreen trees with a minimum height of seven
feet (7'). Forty percent (40%) small size trees and shrubs in a combination
with deciduous trees with a caliper of one and one-half inches (11/2") to two
inches (2") and evergreen trees with a minimum height of four feet (4').
Depending on site conditions, a 50/50 mix of deciduous and evergreen trees and
shrubs should be used for on site landscaping.
         b.   Street trees with a minimum two inch (2") caliper shall be
installed along all public rights-of-way by the developer. The species type,
location, and spacing of trees shall be as shown on the approved landscape
plan, in compliance with designated streets within the City's streetscape plan.
         c.   Parking lot landscaping shall include planters at the ends of
parking rows with shade trees and ground covers. Planters shall be at least
five feet (5') wide. Shade trees and ground covers shall be installed in
planters at minimum intervals, or groups with a ratio of at least one tree per
six (6) parking stalls for double parking rows and one tree per three (3)
parking stalls for single parking rows. Planter areas may also include rocks
(minimum of 3 inches) or bark mulch provided that a commercial grade weed
barrier or fabric is used.
         d.   Landscaping for plazas shall include at least one tree per seven
hundred fifty (750) square feet. At least forty percent (40%) of the plaza area
shall be covered with trees or planted canopy structures. One linear foot of
seating shall be provided for every one foot (1') of perimeter of the plaza
area.
         e.   The landscaping of other open space shall include trees and
ground covers, with a requirement of at least one tree per five hundred (500)
square feet. Trees should be clustered together, where possible, to allow
larger open areas for seating and activities.
      6.   Installation: It shall be the responsibility of the developer to
grade, place topsoil, seed, sod, install sprinkler irrigation systems, and
properly plant trees, shrubs, and other approved plant materials.
      7.   Maintenance: It shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or
property association to properly maintain landscaped areas including watering,
mowing, pruning, fertilizing, and the removal and replacement of dead plant
materials in a timely manner.
      8.   Vegetation Modification/Removal: Pruning vegetation for "exposure",
which results in unnatural plant specimens, is prohibited. Necessary vegetation
removal shall be replaced with equal or better quality plant materials. Trees
that are necessarily removed shall be replaced with a mix of trees with
comparable total caliper. Street tree replacement shall be in compliance with
the City's streetscape plan, unless otherwise approved by the planning staff.
(Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)
      9.   Utility Connections: When disturbances are made to existing
landscaped areas, the existing landscaping must be replaced to its previous
condition. Other modification of landscaped areas shall require approval by the
Planning Director. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017; Ord.
2019-01, 3-5-2019)
   G.   Outdoor Lighting: The lighting of streets, pedestrian areas, parking
lots, and open space is required. Streetlights shall conform to an approved
theme and shall encourage a "village" feel and walking safety. Indirect
lighting, bollard lighting, and landscape lighting is encouraged.
Lighting will be judged as to how adequately it meets its intended purpose.
Design and location of standards and fixtures shall be specified on the site
development drawings. Intensities shall be controlled so that "safety" lighting
is provided while neighboring areas are protected from glare or excessive
direct light. Streetlight design fixtures shall be pedestrian in scale, shall
evoke a "village" feel and be installed and maintained as required.
   H.   Streets And Pedestrianways:
      1.   Streets: All accesses within a mixed use development shall have
connectivity with existing and future street patterns. A grid street pattern or
modified grid pattern is required where practically possible. Cul-de-sac
streets will not be approved unless it can be demonstrated that no other
practical way exists to make connectivity. Private streets are discouraged and
gated communities are prohibited in mixed use developments.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/323f2cbec608bdccc5691f332b6a2969023fb984/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3060.png]
 
      2.   Widths: Street widths shall be determined during site plan review
and approved by the Planning Commission. In general, streets shall be designed
to implement "complete streets" concept as recommended in the document:
"Context Sensitive Solutions in Designing Major Urban Thoroughfares for
Walkable Communities". The level of travel and service should be considered,
while incorporating principles of traffic calming and pedestrian compatibility,
i.e., tree lined streets with pedestrianways and linkages, decreasing the need
for pavement width by spreading traffic through a grid or modified grid street
system.
      3.   Sidewalks And Walkways: The design of pedestrianways may include a
solitary meandering pathway or trail, a "pedestrian street", and the many
possible designs in between. Walkways and connections to trail systems shall be
incorporated into the project. Choice of appropriate pedestrian access will be
made based upon scale, the type of mixed use project being proposed, and by the
way uses are integrated. A standard eleven foot (11') cross section, with a six
foot (6') park strip and a five foot (5') sidewalk, is a minimum, while wider
park strips and/or sidewalks may be required depending upon the land uses and
the desired effect. All streets shall have sidewalks and curbside streetscape.
Pavers, borders, and other sidewalk design materials with compatible colors
shall be used as needed in order to break up expanses of hard surfacing and to
encourage pedestrian interest and activity. In "vertical mixed use" and other
more urban areas, sidewalk adjustments may be required in order to enhance
street and land use connectivity. Portions of the park strip may be paved to
accommodate street furniture, leaving appropriately sized tree wells for street
trees.
Street furniture, including, but not limited to, benches, trash receptacles,
artwork, drinking fountains, bike racks, and newspaper racks, may be required
depending upon the nature of the block face and specific land uses. Street
furniture requirements shall include an overall design theme for compatibility.
      4.   Crosswalks: Extensive use of crosswalks shall be incorporated within
the project, at intersections, midblocks as needed, within parking lots, or
other desirable pedestrian connections. A "pedestrian inconvenience distance"
of one hundred fifty feet (150') shall be used as a guideline. Crosswalks shall
be so configured to be a design feature of the development, i.e., multiple
painted lines, pavers, edges, and other methods of emphasizing pedestrian use
versus auto use. Crosswalk paving materials matching sidewalk materials are
encouraged to further enhance the pedestrian realm. Bulb outs and other
pedestrian design features shall be used to shorten walking distances across
open pavement. Gaps in planted medians shall be used in appropriate areas to
encourage walking and to act as a "refuge" for crossing pedestrians.
   I.   Other Forms Of Transportation: All forms of transportation shall be
considered within and without the mixed use development with the intent to
improve convenience and reduce vehicle trips ("complete streets"). All forms of
transportation should be encouraged, including train, auto, bus, bicycle, and
pedestrian. Access connections shall be required where deemed essential to
provide circulation or access to churches, schools, playgrounds, open space,
shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities.
Appropriate bus turnouts, shelters, stops and other transit options shall be
coordinated and planned as part of the development review process. Based upon
land use and the level of demand, bicycle parking shall be provided in
appropriate locations, i.e., visible from storefronts and entrances to office
buildings.
   J.   Parking Areas: Parking areas shall be considered as structures since
they present a three-dimensional appearance when occupied. Parking areas shall
be designed as follows:
      1.   Location of parking shall be determined not only from its visual
relationship to the building and site, but also as it relates to safe,
convenient pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns. The placing of
building and parking elements on a site shall be evaluated by the Planning
Commission based on the following factors:
         a.   Type of land use and structure.
         b.   Building height and configuration.
         c.   Relationship to other buildings both horizontally and vertically.
         d.   Natural land features such as slopes and vegetation.
         e.   Physical features such as rail lines, canals, and controlled
ingress and egress.
         f.   Visibility from vehicular approaches and distant highways.
         g.   Safe pedestrian connections to buildings, walkways, open space,
and streets.
      2.   Where possible, parking lots shall be broken up and planned as
"outdoor rooms" through the use of buildings, walkways, open space, and
landscape design. When approved, large parking lots shall be broken up with
substantial tree and ground cover plantings. Parking lots should be broken up
into "rooms" of no more than one hundred (100) parking stalls through the use
of connecting walkways.
      3.   Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, parking lots
are prohibited between streets and buildings.
      4.   Underground parking, deck or terrace parking, and parking garages
are encouraged and may be required in conjunction with structures of three (3)
stories or more. Said structures shall have architectural treatments compatible
with area buildings. Parking structures with ground level parking immediately
adjacent to the frontage of a street are prohibited. Parking structures shall
be designed around natural light with "safety" lighting added as needed.
Landscaping, within and without, may be required to enhance compatibility and
safety.
      5.   Developments are not allowed to be "over parked" without
justification. Developments may be approved by the Planning Commission with
less than required parking if evidence can be shown that the nature of the land
uses proposed will not generate the number of stalls as recommended in the
City's parking ordinance. Developments may also be "under parked" if justified
with a walkable design that demonstrates such, and/or where local multimodal
transit systems exist or are immediately planned, which would help reduce the
number of needed parking stalls and/or automobile trips. Shared parking
arrangements may be required in order to reduce unnecessary parking areas and
to encourage pedestrian activity. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05,
3-7-2017)
      6.   Where possible, on street parking shall be provided adjacent to
developments, and a prorated share of such, may be used to satisfy overall
parking requirements. Parallel or angle parking may be approved based upon the
overall design and width of the street, as recommended by the City Engineer and
approved by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-
05, 3-7-2017; Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
   K.   Environmental Concerns:
      1.   Building, landscape, and solar access should be adjusted, where
possible, to be compatible with the local climate. Such design should include,
but not be limited to, window placement, building recesses, overhangs,
trellises, awnings, porches, and landscape placement, planned in such a way to
enhance livability and reduce energy costs.
      2.   The use of lighter colored building materials (i.e., rooftops),
fences/walls, and extensive deciduous and evergreen tree cover shall be
incorporated into developments in order to reduce the urban heat island effect.
Where possible, streets, driveways, parking lots, etc., should use concrete or
other materials which absorb less sunlight.
      3.   Where possible, drought resistant ground covers, shrubs, and trees
shall be incorporated into the landscape to reduce water usage and storm
runoff. Water gardens, landscape swales or other on site drainage design should
be designed into the project. Extensive areas of grass or other high water use
plants without a public purpose are discouraged.
   L.   Service Areas: Loading and refuse collection areas must be screened
from public view. These areas are not permitted between buildings and streets
unless they can be adequately screened through landscaping and architectural
design. Buildings and site improvements must be designed to properly
accommodate loading, unloading and refuse collection, with such being
discouraged on public streets. Screen walls and enclosures shall be constructed
with materials compatible with the structures they serve. Loading and refuse
collection areas shall be properly maintained in a debris free condition.
Except for approved and screened recreational vehicle storage lots associated
with storage areas, including the storage of materials, merchandise, pallets,
etc., shall be within buildings.
   M.   Utilities: Utility companies shall coordinate utility infrastructure
location and grouping to create minimal impact on site design. All utility
lines shall be placed underground in designated easements. No pipe, conduit,
cable, line for water, gas, sewage, drainage, steam, electricity or any other
energy or service shall be installed, and no pole or other support structure
therefor shall be erected, altered or replaced, upon any lot (outside of any
building) above the surface of the ground except for hoses, movable pipes used
for irrigation or other purpose during construction.
      1.   Utility boxes shall be grouped together where possible and screened
with vegetation or other appropriate method. Such facilities shall be
sensitively placed so as to not detract from street aesthetics and pedestrian
design. Gas meters and electric service meters and panels shall be located on
the sides of buildings.
      2.   Where overhead utility poles exist, service lines to new
developments must be placed underground from the nearest overhead service pole.
      3.   This section does not require removal of any existing electrical
transmission facilities and electrical distribution lines nor does it restrict
the repair, minor relocation, and maintenance of any such existing facilities.
However, the developer shall be responsible for the removing or relocating of
utility poles out of the public right-of-way and/or away from the frontage of
the development. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2017-05, 3-7-2017)

CHAPTER 17.90
INDUSTRIAL ZONES
SECTION:
17.90.010: Purpose
17.90.020: Development And Design Standards
17.90.030: Other Requirements
17.90.010: PURPOSE:
This chapter is established to provide standards and regulations, consistent
with the city's general plan and the purposes and provisions of this title, for
industrial areas in the city. This chapter shall apply to the following
industrial zones established in
chapter 17.20, "Zone Establishment", of this title: I-F and C-I zones. Uses may
only be conducted in industrial zones in accordance with the regulations of
this code. Allowed use (permitted and conditional), accessory use, temporary
use, and other associated use regulations may be found in
chapter 17.18, "Uses", of this title.
   A.   I-F Zone: The purpose of the I-F (light industrial-freeway) zone is to
provide areas along the interstate freeway for major commercial uses that are
compatible with the freeway and dependent on freeway visibility and access. The
I-F zone will provide areas for a variety of uses to promote economic diversity
and stability and provide broad employment opportunities. Developments in the
I-F zone should be upscale with attention given to coordination of traffic
circulation and building placement. High architectural standards will maintain
an appropriate introduction and gateway image for the city. The I-F zone should
provide a pleasing and functional environment that represents the quality of
life in the city but also enhances the commercial tax base of the city.
   B.   C-I Zone: The purpose of the C-I (commercial-industrial) zone is to
provide areas where research and development, light manufacturing, assembling,
processing, packaging, warehousing, distribution, and related activities can be
located and preserved without creating significant negative impacts on
surrounding commercial, office, and residential uses. The C-I zone is also
intended to prevent the introduction of more sensitive land uses that may
undermine the industrial or business park nature of the zone. Buffering and
harmonious integration of neighboring uses should provide for compatibility and
continuity in aesthetic design and quality of life in and around the C-I zone.
(Ord. 2015-09, 12-1-2015)
17.90.020: DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Development Review: Uses proposed in industrial zones may only be
established in conformance with the city's development review procedures of the
city. Applicants shall follow the procedures and requirements of this code
regarding development review in the preparation and review of development
proposals in industrial zones. All uses shall be conducted according to the
approved plan or plat and any conditions of approval. Plans or plats may not be
altered without prior approval of the city, except as allowed under state law.
   B.   Area Requirements: Industrial zones shall comply with the requirements
in the area requirements table below:
 
Zone Minimum Zone Area 1  Maximum Zone Area1  Minimum Project Minimum Lot Area

alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant
historic features. "Major alterations" that would destroy the historic
integrity include, but are not limited to, changes in pitch of the main roof,
enlargement or enclosure of windows on the principal facades, addition of upper
stories or the removal of original upper stories, covering the exterior walls
(except adobe) with nonhistoric materials, moving the resource from its
original location to one that is dissimilar to the original, or additions which
significantly detract from or obscure the original form and appearance of the
house when viewed from the public way; or
         b.   It is directly associated with events of historic significance
within the community, it is closely associated with the lives of persons who
were of historic significance in the community, or it exhibits significant
methods of construction or materials that were used within the historic period;
      4.   It has been documented according to the state historic preservation
office standards for intensive level surveys. Copies of such documentation must
have been placed in the local and state historic preservation files.
   D.   Designation Procedures: Any person, group or governmental agency may
nominate a property for listing on the South Jordan historic sites list. The
nomination and listing procedures are as follows:
      1.   Completed intensive level survey documentation for each nominated
property must be submitted in duplicate to the historic preservation committee;
      2.   The committee will review and consider properly submitted
nominations at its next scheduled meeting. The committee will notify the
nominating party, either orally or in writing, one week prior to that meeting
that the nomination will be considered and will place that item on the agenda
posted for the meeting. The one week notification may be waived at the
nominating party's option in order to accommodate "last minute" submittals,
though no nomination will be reviewed if it is submitted to the committee less
than forty eight (48) hours prior to the committee's next scheduled meeting;
      3.   The historic preservation committee will review the documentation
completeness, accuracy and compliance with the criteria for designating
historic properties to the South Jordan historic sites list;
      4.   If the committee determines that the property meets the applicable
requirements, the committee shall submit a recommendation to the city council
that the property be added to the historic sites list. If the committee
determines that the property does not meet the applicable requirements, the
committee shall recommend to the city council that the property not be added to
the historic sites list;
      5.   Upon receipt of a recommendation from the historic preservation
committee, the city council shall schedule a hearing on the matter within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the committee's recommendation. The council
shall notify the nominating party, either orally or in writing, at least one
week prior to the meeting that the nomination will be considered and shall
place the item on the agenda posted for the meeting. At the meeting, the
council shall consider the recommendation from the historic preservation
committee and any other appropriate information from interested parties, and
shall render a decision within seven (7) days of the meeting on the nomination;
      6.   If an application for a demolition permit is submitted for an
existing structure which is at least fifty (50) years old but which has not
been nominated for or received designation as a historic structure under the
provisions of this chapter, the city manager or his designee shall delay
issuance of the demolition permit for up to thirty (30) calendar days. City
staff will notify the historic preservation committee, which may make an
assessment of the historical integrity and significance of the structure and
its property within the context of city history. If the committee determines
that the structure is historically significant, they may meet with the property
owner and discuss possible preservation alternatives. If preservation is not
possible, the historic preservation committee may, with the consent of the
building's owner, document the structure by taking photographs and measurements
of the building to create accurate measured drawings and to preserve a record
of the building. The city manager or his/her designee shall issue the
demolition permit when notified in writing by the committee that either the
building is not historically significant or that documentation has been
completed, but not later than thirty (30) days from the date of application.
   E.   Results Of Designation:

obtain a historic site certificate from the historic preservation committee.
The certificate contains the historic name of the property, the date of
designation, and signatures of the mayor and the historic preservation
committee chairperson.
      2.   Demolition: If a historic site is to be demolished or extensively
altered, efforts will be made to document its physical appearance before that
action takes place.
         a.   The city may delay issuing a demolition permit for a maximum of
ten (10) days and will notify a member of the historic preservation committee,
which will take responsibility for the documentation;
         b.   Documentation will include, at a minimum, exterior photographs
(both black and white and color slides) of all elevations of the historic
building. When possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the
building will be made in order to provide an accurate floor plan drawing of the
building;
         c.   The demolition permit will be issued after ten (10) days of the
initial application whether or not the committee has documented the building.
The permit may be issued earlier if the committee completes its documentation
before the ten (10) day deadline;
         d.   The documentation will be kept in the committee's historic sites
files, which are open to the public in accordance with the city government
records access and management ordinance.
   F.   Removal Of Properties: Properties which, in the opinion of the historic
preservation committee, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility may be
removed from the historic sites list after review and consideration by the
historic preservation committee, and upon approval of the city council. (Ord.
2007-02, 1-16-2007)

record the designation with the county recorder's office to indicate such
designation on the official title of the designated property.
   E.   Result Of Designation:
      1.   Properties designated to the South Jordan historic landmark register
may receive special consideration in the granting of conditional use permits in
order to encourage their preservation.
      2.   Owners of historic landmarks may seek assistance from the historic
preservation committee in applying for grants or tax credits for rehabilitating
their properties.
      3.   Proposed repairs, alterations or additions to historic landmarks are
subject to the review of the historic preservation committee and the subsequent
review and approval of the city council. The purpose of this review is to
ensure the preservation of historic materials and features to the greatest
degree possible:

committee shall review the applications and proposed work for compliance with
the secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation, hereinafter
referred to as the "standards" set forth in section
17.124.050 of this chapter;
         c.   The historic preservation committee's recommendation shall be
forwarded within three (3) days to the city council for their consideration in
reviewing the applications. The recommendations must indicate which of the
standards the committee's decision was based on and, where appropriate, a brief
explanation. Copies of the recommendation shall be sent to the building
inspector and the property owner at the same time;
         d.   The city council shall schedule the matter for its next meeting
and, upon review of the historic preservation committee's recommendations and
other comments given at the meeting, make a decision regarding the
appropriateness of the proposed action. Approved projects will be issued a
"certificate of historical appropriateness" which authorizes the building
permit to be issued.
   F.   Enforcement: Failure to follow standards as required by the city
council may result in the removal of the property from the South Jordan
historic landmark register and the National Register of Historic Places, thus
jeopardizing federal tax credits, grants and conditional approvals. (Ord. 2007-
02, 1-16-2007)
17.124.050: STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION:
The following standards for rehabilitation shall be used by the historic
preservation committee and the city council when determining the historic
appropriateness of any application pertaining to historic landmark properties:
   A.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible purpose
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment.
   B.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should
be avoided when possible.
   C.   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historic basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   D.   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired historic significance in their own
right, and shall be recognized and respected.
   E.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   F.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repairs or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
   G.   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   H.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any rehabilitation project.
   I.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   J.   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were removed in the
future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.
(Ord. 2007-02, 1-16-2007)
17.124.060: ENFORCEMENT OF STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION LAWS:
The city council shall support the enforcement of all state laws relating to
historic preservation. These include, but are not limited to: Utah Code
Annotated sections 17A-3-1301 through 1306, "the historic district act"; Utah
Code Annotated sections 9-8-305, 307 and 308 regarding the protection of Utah
antiquities; and Utah Code Annotated section 9-8-404 regarding notification of
the state historic preservation office of any known proposed action which will
destroy or affect a site, building or object by the state and included on or
eligible for the state or national registers. The city council and/or the
historic preservation committee may elect to review any proposed construction
activity affecting or potentially affecting historic preservation. (Ord. 2007-

17.130.010: DEFINITION AND PURPOSE:
An Overlay Zone represents a geographical area or district where additional
standards, conditions, and/or uses are superimposed upon the underlying zones
within that area or district. A Floating Zone may allow for additional uses and
modification of use regulations and the zoning provisions of the existing base
zone. A Floating Zone is not automatically applicable to a predetermined
location, as with an Overlay Zone, but may be applied to a specific location
after specific standards and conditions are met and after legislative approval
by the City Council. Floating Zones provide greater flexibility for land owners
that own unique properties or who agree to build projects that include high
quality and unique elements not otherwise required by the underlying zone. The
purpose of Overlay Zones and Floating Zones is to provide a zoning tool for the
accomplishment of community goals and policies in the pursuit of the public
health, safety, and welfare in ways not available through typical zoning. (Ord.
2016-05, 5-3-2016)
17.130.020: RESIDENTIAL CHICKENS FLOATING ZONE:
The Residential Chickens Floating Zone is established to provide regulations
and standards for the raising of chickens and egg production in certain
Residential Zones in the City. The Floating Zone is intended to encourage
sustainable local and family food production, while establishing regulations
that control the appropriateness of chickens in a semirural environment as
needed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community. Except for
standards herein allowed under the "Residential Chickens Floating Zone", land
use and development standards shall meet the requirements of the underlying
zone. (Ord. 2012-02, 2-21-2012)
17.130.020.005: STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL CHICKENS:
The Planning Department may approve requests for the raising of residential
chickens and egg production for family food production based upon the following
standards being met: (Ord. 2013-20, 12-17-2013; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
   A.   Residential Land Use Requirement: The raising of chickens in
Residentially zoned areas is permitted, subject to the regulations established
herein, for minimum ten thousand (10,000) square foot residential lots within
the P-C and Single-Family Residential R Zones. Standards for raising chickens
on Agriculturally zoned properties are regulated based upon animal requirements
under the A-1 and A-5 Zones set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 2017-01, 1-3-2017)
   B.   Number And Type Of Chickens Allowed: Up to six (6) chickens per
residential lot may be kept for the purpose of family food production. The
keeping of roosters in Residential Zones is expressly prohibited. Roosters, as
part of pullet stock, may be kept temporarily until such stock is four (4)
months old.
   C.   Coop Size And Location: The size, height, and location of chicken coops
shall be adequate to house the number of chickens on the property and shall
meet the requirements for accessory buildings in the underlying zone, including
setbacks and rear lot coverage. In addition to said requirements, chicken coops
(or the portion of a larger accessory structure used for the raising of
chickens) shall be located at least ten feet (10') from the on site dwelling,
five feet (5') from the property line of an adjoining neighbor, and forty feet
(40') from a dwelling on an adjoining property.
   D.   Chicken Care And Maintenance Guidelines: The raising of residential
chickens and egg production shall be done in such a way that the use is clearly
subordinate to the residential character of the property with no significant
impacts or nuisances being created for the residential neighborhood in general
and adjoining property owners in particular.
      1.   Education And Awareness: Residents interested in residential
chickens and egg production are strongly encouraged to educate themselves as to
appropriate chicken raising methods, Salt Lake County Board of Health
requirements, and City ordinances before purchasing chickens and equipment,
constructing facilities, and obtaining applicable City permits. Residents are
also encouraged to discuss their family food production plans with adjoining
neighbors. Regardless of approvals by the City, the keeping of residential
chickens may be further restricted civilly by homeowners' associations and
recorded restrictive covenants.
      2.   Slaughtering: The slaughtering or processing of chickens outdoors
for food production is expressly prohibited in Residential Zones.
      3.   Feed Containers: The storage and accessibility of chicken feed shall
be so handled to discourage rodents, other vermin, and predators.
      4.   Nuisance: Property owners will ensure that the raising of
residential chickens and egg production is properly conducted and monitored to
not create impacts to neighbors. Approval to raise residential chickens shall
include the construction and maintenance of adequate and comely coops, pens,
enclosures, and property fencing that will confine chickens to the property and
that do not adversely affect neighborhood property values. The maintenance and
cleanliness of facilities and equipment shall be the ongoing responsibility of
the property owner. If and when nuisance issues arise, property owners will
work with neighbors, and City staff as necessary, to amicably resolve concerns.
Complaints shall be considered prima facie nuisances with the burden upon
property owners to resolve the same. (Ord. 2013-20, 12-17-2013)
17.130.020.010: PLOT PLAN, PERMITS, FEES, INSPECTIONS, AND POTENTIAL
REVOCATION:
A onetime residential chicken permit and fee (as established by the City
Council) shall be required for the keeping of residential chickens in approved
Residential Zones. In order to determine compliance with the requirements
herein, two (2) copies of a plot plan shall be submitted to the Planning
Department, drawn to scale, clearly showing the location of all existing and
proposed structures, coops, pens, enclosures, and property fencing as may be
needed depending on the proposed type of residential chicken setup. The plot
plan shall also show building structures on adjoining residential lots.
Distances to on site and off site structures as well as property lines shall be
indicated to facilitate review and compliance. (Ord. 2012-02, 2-21-2012; amd.
Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
Before any required building permits may be issued, appropriate building
construction plans shall be submitted to the City for review and compliance
with Building Codes, along with any applicable building permit fees. Periodic
property inspections may be necessary to determine compliance with residential
chicken standards, as may be deemed appropriate by City staff. Residential
chicken permits may be revoked for noncompliance with the standards stated
herein. (Ord. 2012-02, 2-21-2012)
17.130.020.015: TRANSFERABILITY:
Residential chickens and egg production in Residential Zones is not
transferable. Upon sale of the home or the change of primary occupant, the
approval for residential chickens shall expire, unless otherwise renewed by the
new owner or tenant. A renewed application and permit shall be required if
previously approved residential chickens and egg production is discontinued for
more than one year by the property occupant. (Ord. 2012-02, 2-21-2012)

17.130.050.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Planned Development Floating Zone (PD) is to allow for
flexibility in the application of zoning regulations and development provisions
of this title to advance a public interest through prescriptive requirements of
a development plan and development agreement approved by the City Council. The
PD may be applied to specific geographical areas ("districts") in circumstances
that address a unique situation, confer a substantial benefit to the City, or
incorporate design elements or a mixture of uses that represent a significant
improvement in quality over what could otherwise be accomplished by standard
zoning and development provisions. Such circumstances may include, but are not
limited to: improvements in open space and amenities, environmental and
resource preservation, tree and vegetation protection, slope accommodations,
improved infrastructure efficiency, exceptional and innovative site or building
design, increased public benefits, and complementary integrated land uses. The
City Council shall consider the purpose of the base zone and the impacts on and
from surrounding properties when approving a PD District. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-
2016)

uses, shall be submitted for City Council review. Applicants are encouraged to
work with staff prior to application to achieve an understanding of the
surrounding area, the purpose of the base zone, and the goals and policies of
the City's general plan. The Council shall provide advisory comments and
recommendation regarding the concept plan to assist in the preparation of the
development plan according to subsection B of this section. No action will be
taken by the Council, and comments and recommendations will not obligate,
compel, or constrain future action by the Council.
      2.   Rezone: A PD District shall only be established upon approval by the
City Council as a rezone according to the provisions of
chapter 17.22, "Zoning Amendments", of this title and as may be required
elsewhere in this title, except that the requirement for a conceptual plan in
subsection
17.22.030D of this title shall be replaced with a development plan according to
subsection B of this section. The development plan shall be approved by
development agreement in conjunction with the rezoning approval. (Ord. 2016-05,
5-3-2016)
      3.   Concurrent Site Plan Or Preliminary Subdivision (Optional): At the
applicant's option and with the approval of the Planning Director, the
applicant may submit a site plan application and/or preliminary subdivision
application to be processed concurrently with a PD rezone. In the case of
concurrent applications, Planning Commission approval of a concurrent site plan
and/or preliminary subdivision shall be contingent on the City Council's
approval of the PD rezone. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-
2019)

designation after the designation of the base zone district.
      3.   No permits for development within an approved PD District shall be
issued by the City unless the development complies with the approved
development plan. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016)
      4.   The Planning Director may authorize minor deviations from an
approved development plan to resolve conflicting provisions or when necessary
for technical or engineering considerations. Such minor deviations shall not
affect the vested rights of the PD District and shall not impose increased
impacts on surrounding properties. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2019-01,
3-5-2019)

three (3) years only if approved by the City Council through an approved PD
District. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016)
      2.   Substantial commencement shall be the installation of
infrastructure, a building having started construction, or as determined by the
Planning Director based on significant progress otherwise demonstrated by the
applicant. A project that has not substantially commenced may, at the
discretion of the property owner, develop according to the base zone. A project
that has substantially commenced shall not deviate, in whole or in part, from
the approved PD District, unless amended per section
17.130.050.030 of this section
17.130.050. (Ord. 2016-05, 5-3-2016; amd. Ord. 2019-01, 3-5-2019)
17.130.050.030: AMENDMENTS:
Any application to amend an approved PD District shall be processed as a zone
text amendment, except that an application to extend the district boundaries
shall be processed as a rezone. Any amendment to an approved PD District
requires that the corresponding development agreement also be amended. (Ord.
2016-05, 5-3-2016)
