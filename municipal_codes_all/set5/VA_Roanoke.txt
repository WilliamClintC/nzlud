§ 1.1. - The city and its boundaries. 
    The inhabitants of the territory comprised within the present limits of the city of Roanoke, as hereinafter described, or as the same may be hereafter altered and as provided by law, shall continue to be a body politic and corporate, to be known and designated as the city of Roanoke, and as such shall have and may exercise all powers which are now, or hereafter may be, conferred upon, or delegated to, cities under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, as fully and completely as though such powers were specifically enumerated herein, and no enumeration of particular powers by this charter shall be held to be exclusive; and the city of Roanoke as such shall have perpetual succession, may sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with, and may have a corporate seal which it may alter, renew, or amend at its pleasure. 
    The present boundaries of the city shall be as described in Chapter 216, Acts of Assembly, nineteen hundred fifty-two, as enlarged by orders of the Circuit Court of Roanoke County, Virginia, as follows:

(1)  To raise annually by taxes and assessments in the city such sums of money as the council hereinafter provided for shall deem necessary for the purposes of the city and in such manner as the council shall deem expedient, in accordance with the Constitution and laws of this Commonwealth and of the United States; provided, however, that it shall impose no tax on the bonds of said city. 
(2)  To impose special or local assessments for local improvements and enforce payment thereof, subject, however, to such limitations prescribed by the Constitution of Virginia as may be in force at the time of the imposition of such special or local assessments. 
(3)  Subject to the provisions of the Constitution of Virginia and of §§ 47, 48 and 49 of this charter, to contract debts, borrow money and make and issue evidence of indebtedness. 
(4)  To expend the money of the city for all lawful purposes. 
(5)  To acquire by purchase, lease, lease purchase, gift, bequest, devise, condemnation or otherwise, property, real or personal, or any estate or interest therein, within or without the city or Commonwealth and for any of the purposes of the city; and to hold, improve, sell, lease, mortgage, pledge or otherwise dispose of the same or any other part thereof.

Such encouragement may, without limitations as to other permissible activities, include the expenditure of city funds to promote such activities and to bring notice to the public of entertainments at such public facilities, engaging persons to bring entertainments thereto from which the city may derive income, and the payment of funds to such persons in advance or out of proceeds derived therefrom in connection therewith; and may include entering into agreements with such other persons guaranteeing minimum sums to be payable to such persons for future performances, provided that at no time shall the aggregate amount of all outstanding guarantees be more than such sum as may be fixed by the council. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this charter, the council may appropriate funds to a special or revolving account in order to engage, advertise and promote any such entertainment and to operate any of the foregoing facilities, and when such fund is created such person or persons as may be designated by ordinance of the council, after providing fidelity bond with corporate surety payable to the city in a penalty not less than the authorized amount of such special or revolving fund, may sign checks against said fund and expend cash therefrom for any of the foregoing purposes. 
(8)  To furnish all local public service, to purchase, hire, construct, own, lease, maintain and operate local public utilities, [and] to acquire by condemnation or otherwise, within or without the corporate limits, lands and property necessary for any such purpose. 
(9)  To acquire in any lawful manner in any county of the state, or without the state such water lands, and lands under water as the council of said city may deem necessary for the purpose of providing an adequate water supply for said city and of piping or conducting the same; to lay all necessary mains; to erect and maintain all necessary dams, pumping stations and other works in connection therewith; to process, filter, or purify such water supply and to add thereto mineral or other substances to make the water more potable or more healthful, or to promote the public welfare; to make reasonable rules and regulations for promoting the purity of its said water supply and for protecting the same from pollution; and for this purpose to exercise full police powers and sanitary patrol over all lands comprised within the limits of the watershed tributary to any such water supply wherever such lands may be located in this state; to impose and enforce adequate penalties for the violation of any such rules and regulations; and to prevent by injunction any pollution or threatened pollution of such water supply and any and all acts likely to impair the purity thereof; and to acquire lands or material for any such use. For any of the purposes aforesaid said city may, if the council shall so determine, acquire by condemnation, purchase or otherwise, any estate or interest in such lands or any of them, or any right or easement therein, or may acquire such lands or any of them in fee, reserving to the owner or owners thereof such rights or easements therein as may be prescribed in the ordinance providing for such condemnation or purchase. The said city may sell or supply to persons, firms or industries residing or located outside of the city limits any surplus of water it may have over and above the amount required to supply its own inhabitants. 
(10)  To establish and enforce water rates and rates and charges for public utilities, or other service products, or conveniences, operated, rendered or furnished by the city; to employ necessary competent inspectors to inspect the reservoirs, watersheds, filtering plants, pumps and pumping machinery and all other equipment of and all sources of water supply of every water company furnishing such water for domestic purposes, or use in the homes, of the inhabitants of the city, to compel any such water company, which owns or operates such reservoirs, watersheds, filtering plants, pumps and pumping machinery or other equipment or source or sources of said water supply to pay the reasonable cost of such inspectors; to give reasonable notice to any such water company of any condition disclosed by any such inspection which, in the opinion of said inspector and of a majority of the city council renders, or unless remedied probably will render the said water or water supply of the city or its inhabitants or any part thereof dangerous or unfit to be used for drinking purposes or general domestic purposes and to require any such water company to remedy any such condition within a reasonable time to be stated in said notice; to specify in said notice the particular acts or things which are required to be done by any such water company to remedy or prevent any such condition of said water or water supply; and if said condition be not remedied by said water company and the acts and things specified in said notice to said water company to be done by it, be not done within the time specified in said notice, and if a majority of said city council shall by resolution, at a meeting of the said council, at which said water company has had reasonable notice and opportunity to produce evidence and be heard, declared that an emergency exists requiring the doing of said acts or things, so specified in said notice or any part of them, to remedy or prevent such unfit or improper water or water supply being provided for or furnished to the inhabitants of the city or any of them, then the city council is hereby empowered and it shall be its duty immediately to do the acts or things so specified in said notice to said water company, and in said emergency resolution, and said city council shall have the power and it shall be its duty, either by withholding the water rentals which may thereafter become due from the city to said water company, to reimburse the city for any amount expended in the doing of said acts or things, or to recover said amount from said water company by any appropriate action at law or suit in equity; provided, however, that the maximum amount which the said city may so expend in any calendar half-year period, between January first and June thirtieth, or between July first and December thirty-first, shall not exceed the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars; and provided, further, that any such water company shall have the right by proper legal proceedings to have determined whether or not any such expenditure which may have been so made by said city was made through abuse of discretion or without probable cause to believe said expenditure a necessary one for the protection of the city's water supply; and if in any such proceeding it shall be finally determined that said expenditure was one not necessary for said purpose, said water company shall recover from the city any water rentals which may have been retained as a reimbursement for said expenditure; and provided, further, that if said expenditure be found not a necessary one the city shall be entitled to receive from said water company by reason of said expenditure only such amount as under a quantum meruit it may be determined the said water company has received actual benefit of and in justice ought to pay value received for. Permitting the growth of algae in an amount which materially affects the purity, taste or smell of such water, so as to render the same unfit for drinking purposes or general domestic use, in the reservoirs or sources of water supply is hereby declared a condition which it is the duty of the city council to prevent or remedy under the powers granted in this subsection. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as in anywise limiting, altering, affecting or impairing the existing duties, jurisdiction or powers of the State Corporation Commission or of the State Board of Health or any other agency of the Commonwealth over water companies in the City of Roanoke or elsewhere, but any existing powers, duties or jurisdiction of the State Corporation Commission, State Board of Health or other agency of the Commonwealth which are hereby conferred or imposed upon the city council, shall be deemed to be concurrent.

The city clerk shall assign every ordinance and resolution adopted by the council a permanent serial number. 
    A record of entry made by the city clerk or a copy of such record or entry duly certified by the city clerk shall be prima facie evidence of the terms of the ordinance or any amendment thereof and its due publication, or its receipt in quantity as a printed code of ordinances.

(a)  The council may, in the name and for the use of the city, cause to be issued bonds for any one or more of the following purposes: To provide for parks and other recreational purposes, water supply, water works, electric lights or other lighting system, suitable equipment against fire, or for erecting or improving bridges, viaducts, school buildings, jails, city halls, fire houses, libraries, museums, and other public buildings, incinerators, auditoriums, armories, airports and equipment and furnishings for same; to provide for hospitals and clinics, a local bus transportation system to operate on regular schedules; grading, paving, repaving, curbing, or otherwise improving any one or more of the streets or alleys, or widening existing ones; or to provide for locating, instituting and maintaining sewers, drains and culverts or any other permanent public improvement; to provide for the acquisition of automobiles, trucks and other automotive and movable equipment or a revolving fund for the establishment of a pool of automobiles, trucks and other automotive and movable equipment. No such bonds shall be issued under this charter except by an ordinance or a resolution adopted by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of all members elected to council. Any bonds issued under this charter may be dated, may mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, may be subject to redemption or repurchase at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions and may contain such other provisions, all as determined before their issuance by the council or in such manner as the council shall provide. Any such bonds may bear interest payable at such time or times and at such rate or rates as determined by the council or in such manner as the council may provide, including the determination by reference to indices or formulas or by agents designated by the council under guidelines established by it. The council may fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment. Any such bonds may be issued in registered or book entry form, or in any combination of such forms, as the council may determine. The council may sell any bonds authorized under the provisions of this charter in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as the council may determine. All proceeds received by the city from the sale of bonds issued under this charter shall be deposited and invested in accordance with the provisions of the Public Finance Act of 1991, as from time to time amended. 
(b)  The council, in its discretion, may require that an ordinance adopted by the council authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds, as defined by the Public Finance Act of 1991, as may from time to time be amended, be approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the qualified voters of the city voting on the question at an election for such purpose to be called, held and conducted in accordance with an ordinance or a resolution adopted by the council providing for such election. 
(c)  In no case shall the city issue any bonds or other interest-bearing obligations which, including existing indebtedness, shall at any time exceed ten percent of the assessed valuation of the real estate in the city subject to taxation, as shown by the last preceding assessment for taxes. In determining the limitation for the city there shall not be included the classes of indebtedness described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of Section 10 of Article VII of the Constitution of Virginia. 
(d)  The said council shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds. Any bonds issued under the provisions of this charter may bear or be executed with the facsimile signature of any official authorized to sign or to execute such bonds. If any law shall provide for the sealing of bonds with the official or corporate seal of the city, a facsimile of such seal may be imprinted on the bonds, and it shall not be necessary in such case to impress such seal physically upon such bonds. 
    In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. Any such bond may bear the facsimile signature of, or may be signed by, any person who at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be the proper officer to sign such bond although at the date of such bond such person may not have been such officer. When all signatures on bonds are facsimiles, the bonds must be authenticated by an agent appointed by the council or in such manner as the council may provide. 
(e)  In anticipation of the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this section or under the provisions of the Public Finance Act of 1991, as from time to time amended, and of the receipt of the proceeds of sale of such bonds, the council may, in the name and for the use of the city, by an ordinance or a resolution adopted by the council, cause to be borrowed money for the purpose for which such bonds have been authorized and within the maximum authorized amount of the bond issue. Negotiable notes shall be issued for all moneys borrowed in anticipation of the issuance of bonds under this section or of the Public Finance Act of 1991, as from time to time amended. The ordinance or resolution authorizing any such borrowing shall specify the maximum rate of interest to be paid by the city on such notes, and such notes shall mature and be paid within five years from the date of their original issuance. Any such notes may be extended or refinanced from time to time, provided that no note issued upon any such extension or refinancing shall mature later than five years from the date of the original issuance of such notes. The city may, in its discretion, retire any such loans by means of current revenues, special assessments, or other funds, in lieu of retiring them by means of bonds, and may, thereafter, provide for the issuance of the maximum amount of bonds that has been authorized without reduction by the amount of such loans retired in such manner. The issuance of such notes and other details thereof shall be governed by provisions of the ordinance or the resolution of the council authorizing such borrowing, not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this section. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the council is authorized and required to levy and collect annually, at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes of the city are assessed, levied and collected, a tax upon all taxable property within the city, over and above all other taxes, authorized or limited by law and without limitation as to rate or amount, sufficient to pay when due the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on any general obligation bonds or notes of the city issued under the provisions of this charter to the extent other funds of the city are not lawfully available and appropriated for such purpose. 
(g)  All such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of the Commonwealth and are made securities in which public officers and bodies of the Commonwealth, counties, cities and towns and municipal subdivisions of the Commonwealth, insurance companies and associations, savings banks, savings institutions, savings and loan associations, trust companies, beneficial and benevolent associations, administrators, guardians, executors, trustees and other fiduciaries in the Commonwealth may properly and legally invest funds under their control.

The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
(e)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of zoning appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.

(h)  In exercising the above-mentioned powers such board may, in conformity with the provisions of this act, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.

(j)  Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning appeals, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality, may present to a court of record of the city a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board.

(m)  If, upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or appoint a commissioner to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceeding upon which the determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. 
(n)  Costs shall not be allowed against the board, unless it shall appear to the court that it acted with gross negligence or in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from.

    The council shall appoint an Architectural Review Board. Such board may be authorized to delegate to an agent its authority to issue any certificate of appropriateness. The agent, pursuant to such delegation, shall act only upon an application completed pursuant to the applicable city ordinance, and shall apply the same guidelines and review standards applicable to the board. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the agent made pursuant to this delegation may appeal to the board within a reasonable time as provided by city ordinance by filing with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.

The penalty established by the ordinance shall be imposed on the party deemed by the court to be responsible for the violation and shall not exceed twice the fair market value of the building or structure, as determined by the city real estate tax assessment at the time of the demolition. 
(b)  An action seeking the imposition of such a penalty shall be instituted by petition filed by the city in circuit court, which shall be tried in the same manner as any action at law. It shall be the burden of the city to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission of liability or finding of liability shall not be a criminal conviction for any purpose. The filing of any action pursuant to this section shall preclude a criminal prosecution for the same offense, except where the demolition, razing or moving has resulted in personal injury. 
(c)  The defendant, within twenty-one days after the filing of the petition, may file an answer and, without admitting liability, agree to restore the building or structure as it existed prior to demolition. If the restoration is completed within the time agreed upon by the parties, or as established by the court, the petition shall be dismissed from the court's docket. 
(d)  Nothing in this section shall preclude any other action by the zoning administrator or by the city, as authorized by law, either by separate action or as a part of the petition seeking a civil penalty.

    All general laws of the State applicable to municipal corporations now in existence or hereafter enacted and which are not in conflict with the provisions of this charter or with ordinances or resolutions whereafter enacted by the council pursuant to authority conferred by this charter shall be applicable to the city; provided, however, that nothing contained in this charter shall be construed as limiting the power of the council to enact any ordinance or resolution not in conflict with the Constitution of the State or with the express provisions of this charter.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-279. - Statement of policy. 
(a)  With the ever-increasing scope of operations of the government of the city, it is obvious that the level and quality of service by the city to its people cannot be of the quality and quantity which is both expected and deserved by the people without the active support of many of its qualified and concerned citizens. One (1) of the best ways of involving such persons in the promotion of the best interests of the city and its citizens is to invite them to share some of the responsibilities and opportunities by serving on one (1) or more of the several authorities, boards, commissions and committees appointed by the city council. 
(b)  In order to obtain the best qualified and dedicated people to serve on such bodies, it is incumbent upon the council to maintain a close relationship with them and to give careful and thoughtful consideration to advice and recommendations coming to it from such bodies. There is no surer way to destroy the effectiveness of such a body than to receive, file with thanks and neglect a recommendation from it. 
(Ord. No. 23073, 7-6-76) 
Sec. 2-280. - Establishment generally. 
    The council has in the past established, and may in the future establish, by provisions in this Code, certain authorities, boards and commissions.

All such nominations shall be on a form approved by the council. In making such nomination, it shall be stated that the nominee has been consulted and is willing to serve, if elected. If so requested by any one (1) member of the council, any such appointment shall be made only after the appointee has been interviewed by the council. 
(b)  Membership on boards, authorities, commissions and committees shall, except where required for a specific reason or an unusual circumstance, be restricted to residents of the city. Appointments by the council to authorities, boards, commissions and committees shall be based upon qualifications acquired through experience, training and education, interest, willingness to serve and dedication to promoting the best interests of the city and its residents. Membership shall not be restricted by race, creed, color, sex or religion. It is the intent of council to have a membership balance among the various interests in the city, and, it being the further intent of council to achieve balanced representation of the various neighborhoods and sections of the city on permanent boards, authorities, commissions and committees to which council makes appointments, council shall, in making appointments, give due consideration to the geographic location of the proposed appointee's residence and existing geographic representation on the board, authority, commission or committee to which appointment is proposed.

Chapter 11.3 - STORMWATER DISCHARGE REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 11.3-1. - In general. 
    The City of Roanoke finds that the uncontrolled discharge of pollutants to the city's storm sewer system has an adverse impact on the water quality of the receiving waters. Illicit discharges of substances other than stormwater could result in a significant source of pollutants to the city's storm sewer system. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program, which requires permits for discharges from municipal storm sewer systems into the waters of the United States. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations implementing the NPDES program. Moreover, the EPA has authorized the Commonwealth of Virginia to issue NPDES permits under the Virginia Pollutant Discharge and Elimination System (VPDES) permit system. The VPDES regulations for stormwater discharges require certain municipalities, including the City of Roanoke, to control the contribution of pollutants to its storm sewer system, to prohibit illicit discharges to its storm sewer system, and to inspect, monitor, and enforce the prohibitions of illicit discharges to its storm sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 37151, § 1, 8-15-05) 
Sec. 11.3-2. - Intent and purpose. 
    The intent and purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare of persons in the city through the regulation of stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system and to prohibit the illicit discharge of nonstormwater to the city's storm sewer system, subject to certain exceptions. This chapter is also intended to prohibit illicit connections and illicit discharges to the city's storm sewer system, and to establish inspections and monitoring procedures to ensure compliance with this chapter.

Chapter 11.5 - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 11.5-1. - Authority and effective date. 
    The city is authorized by the provisions of section 15.2-2114, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, to establish a utility to support stormwater management activities consistent with the Virginia Stormwater Management Act, section 10.1-603.1 et seq., Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, and other state and federal stormwater regulations. 
    This Chapter shall be effective July 1, 2014, with the initial stormwater utility fee bill due and payable on or before October 5, 2014 in the same manner prescribed in section 32-16 et seq. of this Code, Real Estate Taxes. Notwithstanding, the city manager is authorized to develop policies, procedures, and manuals necessary to implement this chapter in accordance with section 11.5-2 and to accept applications for credits in accordance with section 11.5-7 prior to July 1, 2014. 
(Ord. No. 39808, § 1, 11-18-13, eff. 7-1-14) 
Sec. 11.5-2. - Purpose and organization. 
    City council finds that an adequate, sustainable source of revenue for stormwater management activities is necessary to protect the general health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city. Further, council finds that parcels, as that term is defined in Appendix A to the city's zoning ordinance, section 36.2-100 et seq. of this Code, with higher amounts of impervious surfaces contribute greater amounts of stormwater and pollutants to the city's stormwater management system and that the owners of such parcels should carry a proportionate burden of the cost of such system. Therefore, council determines that a stormwater utility (utility) based on a parcel's impervious surface cover is in the best interest of the public. 
    The utility shall be operated under the direction of the city manager, who shall organize, direct, and manage the utility, including the development of necessary policies, procedures, and manuals as authorized by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 39808, § 1, 11-18-13) 
Sec. 11.5-3. - Stormwater utility fee. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility fee (fee) imposed on all improved parcels in the city that exist on January 1 of each year regardless of whether the parcel is subject to taxation under section 32-16 et seq. of this Code, Real Estate Taxes. All revenue from the fee shall be deposited into a stormwater utility enterprise fund for the sole purpose of funding the activities described in section 11.5-5. 
(b)  The monthly utility fee rate for each billing unit as defined in section 11.5-10 shall be set by city council by separate ordinance or with the adoption of the city budget. Each improved parcel in the city shall be charged in accordance with section 11.5-6. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the impervious surface of a parcel shall be determined by the city using one (1) or more of the following, at the discretion of the city manager: aerial photography; as-built drawings; final approved site plans; building permits; field surveys; or other appropriate engineering and mapping analysis tools. 
(Ord. No. 39808, § 1, 11-18-13; Ord. No. 39977, 6-16-14, eff. 7-1-14) 
Sec. 11.5-4. - Exemptions. 
    Notwithstanding section 11.5-3 above, the following parcels shall be exempt from the stormwater utility fee: 
(a)  Unimproved parcels as defined in section 11.5-10; 
(b)  Parcels owned by a federal, state, or local government, or public entity, that holds a permit to discharge stormwater from a municipal separate storm sewer system, except that this exemption shall apply only to parcels or portions of parcels covered by any such permit and shall not apply to parcels owned and maintained by the City of Roanoke that are not otherwise exempt under subsection (c) below; and, 
(c)  Public roads and street rights-of-way that are owned and maintained by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of Roanoke, or a local agency, including property rights-of-way acquired through the acquisitions process. 
(Ord. No. 39808, § 1, 11-18-13) 
Sec. 11.5-5. - Stormwater utility enterprise fund. 
    There shall be established a stormwater utility enterprise fund (fund) from the deposit of all fees, charges, and other revenue collected by the utility, as well as any other revenue as may be determined by council or the city manager, including but not limited to grants and special appropriations. The fund shall be used exclusively to pay or recover costs for the following: 
(a)  The acquisition by gift, purchase, or condemnation, as authorized by law, of real and personal property, and interest therein, necessary to construct, operate, and maintain stormwater control facilities; 
(b)  The cost of administration of such programs; 
(c)  Planning, design, engineering, construction, and debt retirement for new facilities and enlargement or improvement of existing facilities, including the enlargement or improvement of dams, levees, floodwalls, and pump stations, whether publicly or privately owned, that serve to control stormwater; 
(d)  Facility operation and maintenance, including the maintenance of dams, levees, floodwalls, and pump stations, whether publicly or privately owned, that serve to control stormwater; 
(e)  Monitoring of stormwater control devices and ambient water quality monitoring; and 
(f)  Other activities consistent with the state or federal regulations or permits governing stormwater management, including, but not limited to, public education, watershed planning, inspection and enforcement activities, and pollution prevention planning and implementation. 
(Ord. No. 39808, § 1, 11-18-13) 
Sec. 11.5-6. - Stormwater utility fee calculation. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided, the minimum stormwater utility fee shall be the rate established for one (1) billing unit and shall be calculated for each parcel in the following manner: 
(1)  Determine the impervious surface of the parcel in square feet. 
(2)  Divide the impervious surface of the parcel by the billing unit. 
(3)  Round the resulting calculation to the nearest whole number to determine the number of billing units. 
(4)  Multiply the number of billing units determined in subsection (3) above by the rate established in section 11.5-3 to obtain the stormwater utility fee for the parcel. 
(b)  Where a parcel with impervious surface is held in common ownership, the fee shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (a) above. The city manager may directly bill the entity responsible for the parcel held in common ownership, or distribute the resulting fee equally among those owning an interest in the parcel held in common ownership. In addition, the city manager, in his or her sole discretion, may develop alternative methodologies for billing a parcel held in common ownership on a case-by-case basis. 
(Ord. No. 39808, § 1, 11-18-13) 
Sec. 11.5-7. - Stormwater utility fee credits. 
    Sections 15.2-2114.B, 15.2-2114.D, and 15.2-2114.E, Code of Virginia, as amended, recognize that a continued investment in an on-site stormwater management facility or other best management practice results in a reduced impact on the public stormwater management system or on the receiving surface waters downstream of the parcel. 
    The city manager is authorized to adopt policies, procedures, and manuals necessary to implement, administer, and enforce this section. 
(a)  Credit eligibility. Only on-site stormwater management facilities and other best management practices meeting the following criteria are eligible for a credit against the stormwater utility fee: 
(1)  The parcel owner must submit a credit application form provided by the city in accordance with subsection (c) below. 
(2)  The parcel owner must maintain the structure and function of a stormwater management facility and operate the stormwater management facility, or implement and maintain any such other best management practice set forth in the credit application. 
(3)  The parcel owner must have a properly executed maintenance agreement with the city that has been properly recorded in the land records of the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke. 
(4)  The parcel owner must demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the facility or any such other best management practice is functioning as originally designed. The structure must be maintained to the satisfaction of the city manager in accordance with the properly executed maintenance agreement.

Sec. 11.7-8. - Monitoring, reports, and inspections. 
(a)  The responsible land disturber shall be in charge of and responsible for carrying out the land-disturbing activity and provide for periodic inspections of the land-disturbing activity. The program administrator may require the person responsible for carrying out the plan to monitor the land-disturbing activity. The person responsible for carrying out the plan will maintain records of these inspections and maintenance, to ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. 
(b)  The program administrator shall periodically inspect the land-disturbing activity in accordance with 9VAC25-840-60 of the Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations to ensure compliance with the approved plan and to determine whether the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. The owner, permittee, or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be given notice of the inspection. 
    If the program administrator determines that there is a failure to comply with the plan, notice shall be served upon the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan by mailing with confirmation of delivery to the address specified in the permit application or in the plan certification, or by delivery at the site of the land-disturbing activities to the agent or employee supervising such activities. 
    The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. Upon failure to comply within the specified time, the permit may be revoked and the permittee or person responsible for carrying out the plan shall be subject to the penalties provided by this chapter. 
(c)  Upon issuance of an inspection report denoting a violation of sections 62.1-44.15:55 and 62.1-44.15:56 of the Code of Virginia, the program administrator may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in this ordinance, issue an order requiring that all or part of the land-disturbing activities permitted on the site be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken. 
    If land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan, the program administrator may issue an order requiring that all of the land-disturbing activities be stopped until an approved plan or any required permits are obtained. 
    Where the alleged noncompliance is causing or is in imminent danger of causing harmful erosion of lands or sediment deposition in waters within the watersheds of the commonwealth, or where the land-disturbing activities have commenced without an approved plan or any required permits, such an order may be issued without regard to whether the alleged violator has been issued a notice to comply as specified in this ordinance. Otherwise, such an order may be issued only after the alleged violator has failed to comply with such a notice to comply. 
    The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven (7) days from the date of service pending application by the city or permit holder for appropriate relief to the Roanoke City Circuit Court. The city shall serve such order for disturbance without an approved plan or permits upon the owner by mailing with confirmation of delivery to the address specified in the land records. Said order shall be posted on the site where the disturbance is occurring, and shall remain in effect until permits and plan approvals are secured, except in such situations where an agricultural exemption applies. 
    If the alleged violator has not obtained an approved plan or any required permits within seven (7) days from the date of service of the order, the program administrator may issue an order to the owner requiring that all construction and other work on the site, other than corrective measures, be stopped until an approved plan and any required permits have been obtained. Such an order shall be served upon the owner by mailing with confirmation of delivery to the address specified in the permit application or the land records of the city. 
    The owner may appeal the issuance of an order to the Roanoke City Circuit Court. 
    Any person violating or failing, neglecting or refusing to obey an order issued by the program administrator may be compelled in a proceeding instituted in the Roanoke City Circuit Court to obey same and to comply therewith by injunction, mandamus or other appropriate remedy. 
    Upon completion and approval of corrective action or obtaining an approved plan or any required permits, the order shall immediately be lifted. 
    Nothing in this section shall prevent the program administrator from taking any other action authorized by this chapter.

Any such civil penalties shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions and shall preclude the prosecution of such violation as a misdemeanor under subsection A of section 62.1-44.15:63 of the Code of Virginia. 
(c)  The program administrator, or the owner or property which has sustained damage or which is in imminent danger of being damaged, may apply to the Roanoke City Circuit Court to enjoin a violation or a threatened violation of Sections 62.1-44.15:55 or 62.1-44.15:56 of the Code of Virginia, without the necessity of showing that an adequate remedy at law does not exist. 
    However, an owner of property shall not apply for injunctive relief unless such owner has notified in writing the person who has violated the local program, and the program administrator, that a violation of the local program has caused, or creates a probability of causing, damage to such owner's property, and neither the person who has violated the local program nor the program authority has taken corrective action within fifteen (15) days to eliminate the conditions which have caused, or create the probability of causing, damage to his property. 
(d)  In addition to any criminal or civil penalties provided under this ordinance, any person who violates any provision of sections 62.1-44.15:55 through 62.1-44.15:65 of the Code of Virginia may be liable to the city in a civil action for damages.

A civil action for such violation or failure may be brought by the city. 
    Any civil penalties assessed by a court shall be paid into the treasury of the city, except that where the violator is the locality itself, or its agent, the court shall direct the penalty to be paid into the state treasury. 
(f)  With the consent of any person who has violated or failed, neglected or refused to obey any regulation or condition of a permit or any provision of this ordinance, or order of the program administrator, the city may provide for the payment of civil charges for violations in specific sums, not to exceed the limit specified in subsection e of this section. Such civil charges shall be instead of any appropriate civil penalty which could be imposed under subsections b or e of this section. 
(g)  The commonwealth's attorney shall, upon request of the city, take legal action to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
(h)  Compliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall be prima facie evidence in any legal or equitable proceeding for damages caused by erosion, siltation or sedimentation that all requirements of law have been met, and the complaining party must show negligence in order to recover any damages. 
(Ord. No. 41142, § 2, 5-21-18) 
Sec. 11.7-10. - Appeals and judicial review. 
(a)  Final decisions of the program administrator under this chapter shall be subject to review by the Roanoke City Circuit Court, provided an appeal is filed within thirty (30) days from the date of any written decision adversely affecting the rights, duties, or privileges of the person engaging in or proposing to engage in land-disturbing activities.

(a)  The dumping, casting, leaving or otherwise disposing of solid waste or other unsightly matter on a public highway, street or right-of-way, park or other public property, or on private property, without the written consent of the owner thereof, is prohibited. 
(b)  When any person is arrested for a violation of this section, and the solid waste alleged to have been dumped, cast, left or otherwise disposed of on a public highway, street or right-of-way, park, or other public property, or on private property without the written consent of the owner thereof, has been ejected from a motor vehicle, the arresting officer may comply with the provisions of section 20-2 of this Code in making such arrest.

(d)  Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. 
(e)  Upon conviction of any person for a violation of this section, the court may suspend the imposition of any sentence on condition that the defendant volunteer his services for such period of time as the court may designate to remove litter from any public highway, street or right-of-way or other public property. 
(f)  The above subsections notwithstanding, the city manager may order, in writing, either the owner or, if a property is not occupied by an owner, the occupant of such property, to remove solid waste found lying or located on the city right-of-way placed there by either of such persons in violation of any provision of this chapter. The order shall be personally served on such owner or occupant by the city manager, who shall note the time, place and manner of such service on a duplicate copy of the notice to be retained by the city manager. In lieu of such personal service, such notice may be posted on the owner's property in a conspicuous location and a copy of such notice sent through the United States Postal Service by mail postage prepaid, addressed to such owner at his or her last-known address as set forth in the city's real estate valuation records. The notice shall state the time within which the action or work ordered to be done must be completed, and such time shall not be less than twenty-four (24) hours before such person shall have received notice of the work ordered to be done. The notice shall further state that if such person does not complete such work within such time period, the city may abate such violation or hire a private contractor to perform the work and bill the owner for such abatement costs. If the owner does not pay such costs, the notice shall further advise that the unpaid costs of the abatement, together with the administrative fee and any interest, may constitute a lien against the property in favor of the city. Any person receiving such notice shall immediately proceed to remove such solid waste and provide proof of proper disposal acceptable to the city manager, such as a disposal receipt from the transfer station. 
(g)  Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any person upon whom notice has been served pursuant to subsection 14.1-3(f) of the City Code to comply with such order, the city manager may have the removal performed by city personnel or a private contractor. The city manager shall keep an account of the cost for such removal and shall bill the owner responsible for placing the solid waste within the right-of-way plus an administrative processing fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition to the actual cost and fees incurred in the removal and disposal of such solid waste. If such bill is not paid within thirty (30) days, the city may charge and collect the cost thereof from the responsible owner in any manner provided by law for the collection of state or local taxes. Every charge in excess of two hundred dollars ($200.00) which has been assessed against the owner of property affected by this section and which remains unpaid shall constitute a lien against such property. Prosecution for failure, neglect or refusal of such person to remove such solid waste shall not be barred by the city proceeding to have the work done in accordance with this section. 
(h)  The city manager shall cause a notice of the lien of the special assessment prepared by the city attorney to be recorded in the clerk's office of the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke, Virginia. The city attorney may take appropriate steps, including a personal or in rem suit or action in the appropriate court, to enforce the lien to satisfy the special assessment. 
(i)  The director of finance and the city treasurer, when in their discretion it is just and proper to do so, may waive liens imposed pursuant to this section whenever doing so will facilitate the sale of the property and encourage its productive reuse. Such liens may be waived only as to a purchaser who is unrelated by blood or marriage to the owner and who has no business association with the owner. All such liens shall remain a personal obligation of the owner of the property at the time the liens were imposed.

Different fees may be charged based upon the use of the parcel as (i) single family dwelling unit on one (1) parcel; (ii) multiple dwelling units on one (1) parcel; or (iii) business, commercial establishment, institution, or other location uses, other than dwelling unit purposes. The city may exempt, defer, or provide discounts to parcel owners who receive an exemption pursuant to section 32-84 of the city code with respect to the payment of real estate taxes by certain elderly or disabled persons. 
    For condominium developments where the owner of each condominium unit receives solid waste services directly from the city, each condominium unit shall be assessed the solid waste collection fee as a single family dwelling unit. For condominium developments where the city provides solid waste services solely to the condominium association, the condominium development shall be considered a multiple dwelling unit and the condominium association shall be assessed one (1) solid waste collection fee as a multiple dwelling unit. 
(b)  The parcel owner of any parcel, or contiguous parcels all under ownership by the same parcel owner and which contiguous parcels are being used for one unified purpose, shall be responsible for payment of all fees pertaining to the removal and disposal of solid waste. For purposes of this Section 14.1-5, (i) except as provided in Section 14.1-5(c)(1), the parcel owner shall be the person or persons identified in the real estate tax records of the city as owner of the parcel or contiguous parcels as of July 1 in each fiscal year; and (ii) parcel shall mean a parcel of real estate identified by the city with an Official Tax Map Number. 
(c)  (1)  For the July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 fiscal year, the fees pertaining to removal and disposal of solid waste for parcel owners eligible for any of such services, and not exempted by the city from the receipt of all of such services by virtue of using a trash compactor in the Central Business District or using a private solid waste removal company, shall commence as of January 1, 2018, and shall be billed for the period of January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018, by the city treasurer to the parcel owner identified in the real estate tax records of the city as of January 1, 2018, in one (l) installment due on March 30, 2018. Such solid waste fees may be billed separately or may be combined with other billings, and, when combined, payment will be applied first to the solid waste collection fees then due and payable, then to other amounts identified and due in such billing. Provided, however, where any such account has one or more delinquent amounts past due, payment will be applied first to such fee or tax, together with any cumulative interest and penalties thereon, that is the most delinquent before the payment will be applied to any current amounts due. 
(2)  Commencing with the July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 fiscal year, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the fees pertaining to removal and disposal of solid waste for parcel owners eligible for any such services, and not exempted by the city from the receipt of such services by virtue of using a trash compactor in the Central Business District, arranging for paid collection service in the portion of the Central Business District that is outside of the Sealed Compactor Zone, or using a private solid waste removal company, shall be billed and payable on the same schedule as prescribed in Section 32-18, when due and payable, of Article II, Real Estate Taxes, Generally, of Chapter 32, Taxation, of the City Code. Such solid waste collection fees shall be combined with the real estate tax billings and other billings included thereon, and, when combined, payment will be applied first to the solid waste collection fees, then to any applicable stormwater utility fee, and then to all other taxes and fees, as determined by the city treasurer. Provided, however, where any such account has one or more delinquent amounts past due, payment will be applied first to such fee or tax, together with cumulative interest and penalties thereon, that is the most delinquent before the payment will be applied to any current amounts due. 
(d)  Pursuant to section 15.2-105, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, the failure to pay the full amount of the solid waste collection fee when due will be assessed a penalty of ten (10) percent and incur interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum.

    It is hereby declared to be the intent of this chapter that, in order to distribute the tax burden of the city, any business, employment or profession located or conducted in the city, and the persons, firms, associations and corporations engaged therein and the agents thereof, shall, except as otherwise specifically provided, be subject to an annual license issuance fee or an annual license tax under this chapter. 
    When the gross receipts of a business, employment or profession are one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) or less, there is hereby levied and there shall be assessed and collected a fifty dollar ($50.00) fee for issuing each license required by this chapter for each and every license year, except as otherwise specifically provided. When the gross receipts of a business, employment or profession exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), there is hereby levied and there shall be assessed and collected the license taxes as set forth in this chapter for each and every license year. These license fees and license taxes shall be for the support of the city government, the payment of city debts, and interest thereon and other municipal purposes. 
    Any business, employment or profession required to obtain a license pursuant to sections 19-71, 19-72, 19-73, 19-74, 19-74.1, 19-75, 19-76, 19-77, 19-78, 19-78.1, 19-79, 19-80, or 19-81.1 of this Code shall not be assessed the fifty dollar ($50.00) issuance fee.

Sec. 19-1.2. - License required; requiring evidence of payment of business license, business personal property, meals and admissions taxes. 
(a)  Whenever a license is required by this chapter, it shall be unlawful to engage in any business, employment or profession for which a license issuance fee or license tax is imposed by this chapter, without first obtaining the required license. 
(b)  No business license under this chapter shall be issued until the applicant has produced satisfactory evidence that all delinquent business license, personal property, meals, transient occupancy, severance and admissions taxes owed by the business to the city have been paid. Provided, however, such business license may not be denied solely on the basis of delinquent taxes, penalties or interest when the taxpayer has one (1) of the following bona fide appeals pending (all references are to the Code of Virginia (1950) as amended): 
(1)  Application for correction of an assessment of taxes pursuant to § 58.1-3980; 
(2)  Appeal of a local license tax pursuant to § 58.1-3703.1; 
(3)  Appeal by a political subdivision pursuant to § 58.1-3982 of a correction of assessment of local taxes;

(c)  Any person who engages in a business without obtaining the required license, or after being refused a license, shall not be relieved of the license issuance fee or license tax imposed by the chapter. 
(d)  If any person shall commence to engage in any business, employment or profession licensable under this chapter without first obtaining such license, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, unless otherwise specifically provided by this chapter, shall on conviction thereof, be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such conviction thereof shall not relieve any such person from the payment of the license issuance fee or license tax prescribed by this chapter. If such violation is continued for one (1) month, such person shall moreover be subject to a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the license tax which was due and payable at the beginning of such month, in addition to the license tax imposed by this chapter, and such penalty shall be assessed and paid along with the license tax and shall become a part of the license tax and shall be enforced in the manner provided by the law for the enforcement of the collection of other taxes. 
(e)  If the commissioner of revenue has knowledge of a violation of this section, it shall be his duty to cause the person in violation to be summoned before him to obtain the required license, or to cause such person to be summoned before the general district court to be tried for the violation, or both. The duty herein imposed on the commissioner shall not relieve the police force of the city from the general duty of enforcing the provisions of this chapter or any other ordinance of the city.

(10)  On or measured by receipts or purchases by a corporation which is a member of an affiliated group of corporations from other members of the same affiliated group; this exclusion shall not exempt affiliated corporations from such license or other tax measured by receipts or purchases from outside the affiliated group; this exclusion also shall not preclude the city from levying a wholesale merchant's license issuance fee or license tax on an affiliated corporation on those sales by the affiliated corporation to a nonaffiliated person, company, or corporation, notwithstanding the fact that the wholesale merchant's license tax would be based upon purchases from an affiliated corporation; such tax shall be based on the purchase price of the goods sold to the nonaffiliated person, company, or corporation. As used in this subsection the term "sales by the affiliated corporation to a nonaffiliated person, company or corporation" shall mean sales by the affiliated corporation to a nonaffiliated person, company or corporation where goods sold by the affiliated corporation or its agent are manufactured or stored in the commonwealth prior to their delivery to the nonaffiliated person, company or corporation;

(Ord. No. 32959, § 1, 6-3-96) 
Sec. 19-2. - Definitions. 
    The following words and terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section for the purpose of this chapter: 
    Affiliated group shall mean: 
(1)  One (1) or more chains of corporations subject to inclusion connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is a corporation subject to inclusion if: 
a.  Stock possessing at least eighty (80) percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least eighty (80) percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of each of the corporations subject to inclusion, except the common parent corporation, is owned directly by one (1) or more of the other corporations subject to inclusion; and 
b.  The common parent corporation directly owns stock possessing at least eighty (80) percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least eighty (80) percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of at least one (1) of the other subject to inclusion corporations. As used in this subsection, the term "stock" does not include nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends; the phrase "corporation subject to inclusion" means any corporation within the affiliated group irrespective of the state or country of its incorporation; and the term "receipts" includes gross receipts and gross income. 
(2)  Two (2) or more corporations if five (5) or fewer persons who are individuals, estates or trusts own stock possessing: 
a.  At least eighty (80) percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least eighty (80) percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation; and 
b.  More than fifty (50) percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than fifty (50) percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation. 
When one (1) or more of the corporations subject to inclusion, including the common parent corporation, is a nonstock corporation, the term "stock" as used in this subsection shall refer to the nonstock corporation membership or membership voting rights, as is appropriate to the context. 
    Assessment shall mean a determination as to the proper rate of tax, the measure to which the tax rate is applied, and ultimately the amount of tax, including additional or omitted tax, that is due. An assessment shall include a written assessment made pursuant to notice by the assessing official or a self-assessment made by a taxpayer upon the filing of a return or otherwise not pursuant to notice. Assessments shall be deemed made by an assessing official when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by the assessing official or an employee of the assessing official, or mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed, or if no return is required, when the tax is paid. A return filed or tax paid before the last day prescribed by ordinance for the filing or payment thereof shall be deemed to be filed or paid on the last day specified for the filing of a return or the payment of tax, as the case may be. 
    Base year shall mean the calendar year preceding the license year, except for contractors subject to the provisions of section 58.1-3715[, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended,] or unless the local ordinance provides for a different period for measuring the gross receipts of a business, such as for beginning businesses or to allow an option to use the same fiscal year as for federal income tax purposes. 
    Business shall mean a course of dealing which requires the time, attention and labor of the person so engaged for the purpose of earning a livelihood or profit. It implies a continuous and regular course of dealing, rather than an irregular or isolated transaction. A person may be engaged in more than one (1) business. The following acts shall create a rebuttable presumption that a person is engaged in a business: (i) advertising or otherwise holding oneself out to the public as being engaged in a particular business or (ii) filing tax returns, schedules and documents that are required only of persons engaged in a trade or business. 
    Commissioner shall mean the commissioner of the revenue of the city. 
    Definite place of business shall mean an office or a location at which occurs a regular and continuous course of dealing for thirty (30) consecutive days or more. A definite place of business for a person engaged in business may include a location leased or otherwise obtained from another person on a temporary or seasonal basis and real property leased to another. A person's residence shall be deemed to be a definite place of business if there is no definite place of business maintained elsewhere and the person is not subject to licensure as a peddler or itinerant merchant. 
    Director of finance shall mean the director of finance of the city. 
    Financial services shall mean the buying, selling, handling, managing, investing, and providing of advice regarding money, credit, securities, or other investments. 
    Gross receipts shall mean the whole, entire, total receipts, without deduction. Gross receipts shall not include any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business. The following items are excluded from gross receipts: 
(1)  Amounts received and paid to the United States, the commonwealth or any county, city or town for the Virginia retail sales or use tax, for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on cigarettes, for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels. 
(2)  Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business). 
(3)  Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the business to its customer. 
(4)  Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the obligor. 
(5)  Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon the sale of a capital asset. 
(6)  Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by the licensee. A rebate or other incentive offered to induce the recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a person other than the offeror, and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration of the sale goods and services shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the licensee, but shall be included in the licensee's gross receipts together with any handling or other fees related to the incentive. 
(7)  Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution and for which no consideration is received and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory whether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. 
(8)  Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a business subject to licensure not classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to interest on bank accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the licensed privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, late fees and similar income attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular course of business. 
    The following shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases that would otherwise be taxable: 
(1)  Any amount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to a United States federal or state government entity provided that such property was purchased within two (2) years of the sale to said entity by the original purchaser who shall have been contractually obligated at the time of purchase to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This deduction shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply to only the original cost of the property and not to its resale price, and the deduction shall not apply to any of the tangible personal property which was the subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or federal government entity in accordance with the original contract obligation. 
(2)  Any receipts attributable to business conducted in another state or foreign country in which the taxpayer is liable for an income or other tax based upon income. 
    License year shall mean the calendar year for which a license is issued for the privilege of engaging in business. 
    Merchant shall mean any person whose business, or any part of it, consists of buying, or otherwise acquiring, and selling, leasing or otherwise disposing of goods, wares, merchandise, commodities, supplies, machinery, equipment or any other article of personal property. 
    Professional services shall mean services performed by architects, attorneys-at-law, certified public accountants, dentists, engineers, surveyors, surgeons, veterinarians, and practitioners of the healing arts (the arts and sciences dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure or alleviation of human physical or mental ailments, conditions, diseases, pain or infirmities) and such occupations, and no others, as the department of taxation may list in the BPOL guidelines promulgated pursuant to section 58.1-3701[, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended]. The department shall identify and list each occupation or vocation in which a professed knowledge of some department of science or learning, gained by a prolonged course of specialized instruction and study, is used in its practical application to the affairs of others, either advising, guiding, or teaching them and in serving their interests or welfare in the practice of an art or science founded on it. The word "profession" implies attainments in professional knowledge as distinguished from mere skill, and the application of knowledge to uses for others rather than for personal profit. 
    Purchases shall mean all goods, wares and merchandise received for sale at each definite place of business of a wholesale merchant. The term shall also include the cost of manufacture of all goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by any wholesale merchant and sold or offered for sale. A wholesale merchant may elect to report the gross receipts from the sale of manufactured goods, wares and merchandise if it cannot determine the cost of manufacture or chooses not to disclose the cost of manufacture. 
    Real estate services means providing a service with respect to the purchase, sale, lease, rental, or appraisal of real property. 
    Treasurer shall mean the treasurer of the city.

Sec. 19-19. - Tax for beginners, etc. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided, for the purpose of ascertaining the license tax to be paid by a person beginning business, if the license tax is based in whole or in part on sales, purchases, commissions, contracts, orders, receipts or fair value of articles or commodities manufactured, processed or produced, such person shall estimate what they will be between the date of the issuance of his license and December 31 following. Every overestimate and every underestimate shall be subject to revision by the commissioner and it shall be the duty of the commissioner to assess such person with such additional taxes as may be found to be due at any time after the issuance of such license, and on, or prior to, December 31 following. It shall be the further duty of the commissioner, upon proper application of the licensee, to abate or refund such portion of such tax as may be found to be attributable to an overestimation of the business so licensed, provided such application is made within one (1) year from the thirty-first day of December in the year in which such assessment was made. The commissioner may, at his discretion and at such times after the issuance of such license as he may deem expedient, investigate and ascertain whether any such beginner has underestimated such business. If upon any such investigation the commissioner shall determine that such beginner has, in fact, underestimated such business, the tax payable on the estimate, as revised by the commissioner, shall be immediately due and payable, and if not immediately paid by the beginner, such license shall be forthwith revoked. Every such license shall be so revised and the additional tax, if any, found to be due paid before such license shall be renewed or transferred. 
(b)  Except as otherwise expressly provided, the license tax of every person who was licensed at a definite place of business for only a part of the next preceding license year, and whose license is measured by purchases, sales, commissions, contracts, costs, orders, receipts or fair value, shall be computed for the then current license year on the basis of an estimate of such measure for the then current license year. Every underestimate made under this subsection shall be corrected by the commissioner, whose duty it shall be to assess such person with such additional tax as may be found to be due at the end of the tax year on the basis of the true measure of such license tax. It shall be the further duty of the commissioner, upon proper application of the licensee, to abate or refund such portion of such tax as may be found to be attributable to an overestimation of the business so licensed, provided such application is made within one (1) year from the thirty-first day of December in the year in which such assessment was made. 
(Code 1956, Tit. VI, Ch. 8, §§ 18, 19) 
Sec. 19-20. - When application due; when tax payable; extensions; penalty and interest for late payment; report and collection of delinquencies. 
(a)  Each person subject to a license issuance fee or license tax shall apply for a license prior to beginning business if he was not subject to licensure in the city on or before January 1 of the license year, or no later than March 1 of the license year if he had been issued a license for the preceding year. The application shall be on forms prescribed by the commissioner. 
(b)  The commissioner may grant an extension of time in which to file an application for a license, for reasonable cause. Any such extension shall be conditioned upon the timely payment of a reasonable estimate of the appropriate tax; the tax is then subject to adjustment to the correct tax at the end of the extension, together with interest from the due date until the date paid and, if the estimate submitted with the extension is found to be unreasonable under the circumstances, with a penalty of ten (10) percent of the portion paid after the due date. 
(c)  All license issuance fees and license taxes imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable on or before March 1 of each license year, unless otherwise expressly provided. 
(d)  If the tax is not paid by the appropriate due date as set forth above, a penalty of ten (10) percent of the tax shall be imposed. In the case of an assessment of additional tax made by the assessing official, if the application was made in good faith and the understatement of the tax was not due to any fraud, reckless or intentional disregard of the law by the taxpayer, there shall be no late payment penalty assessed with the additional tax. If any assessment of tax by the assessing official is not paid within thirty (30) days, the treasurer shall impose a ten (10) percent late payment penalty. If the failure to pay was not the fault of the taxpayer, the penalties shall not be imposed, or if imposed shall be abated by the treasurer. In order to demonstrate lack of fault, the taxpayer must show that he acted responsibly and that the failure was due to events beyond his control. 
(e)  When used in the subsection "acted responsibly" means that: (i) the taxpayer exercised the level of reasonable care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in determining the filing obligations for the business and (ii) the taxpayer undertook significant steps to avoid or mitigate the failure, such as requesting appropriate extensions (where applicable), attempting to prevent a foreseeable impediment, acting to remove an impediment once it occurred, and promptly rectifying a failure once the impediment was removed or the failure discovered. 
(f)  When used in the subsection "events beyond the taxpayer's control" include, but are not limited to, the unavailability of records due to fire or other casualty; the unavoidable absence (e.g., due to death or serious illness) of the person with the sole responsibility for tax compliance; or the taxpayer's reasonable reliance in good faith upon erroneous written information from the commissioner who was aware of the relevant facts relating to the taxpayer's business when he provided the erroneous information. 
(g)  Interest shall be charged on the late payment of the tax from the due date until the date paid without regard to fault or other reason for the late payment. Whenever an assessment of additional or omitted tax by the assessing official is found to be erroneous, all interest and penalty charged and collected on the amount of the assessment found to be erroneous shall be refunded together with interest on the refund from the date of payment or the due date, whichever is later. Interest shall be paid on the refund of any license tax from the date of payment or due date, whichever is later, whether attributable to an amended return or other reason. Interest on any refund shall be paid at the same rate charged under section 58.1-3916, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. 
(h)  No interest shall accrue on an adjustment of estimated tax liability to actual liability at the conclusion of a base year. No interest shall be paid on a refund or charged on a late payment, provided the refund or the late payment is made not more than thirty (30) days from the date of the payment that created the refund or the due date of the tax, whichever is later. 
(i)  The city treasurer shall collect each unpaid license issuance fee and license tax, and any interest and penalty thereon. 
(j)  The provisions of this section relating to penalties and interest shall be applicable to assessments made on and after January 1, 1997 even if for an earlier license year.

The form of every license issuable by the commissioner shall be prescribed by the city treasurer. The application and statement under oath required by section 19-11 shall form a part of the license issued.

(a)  Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed for the assessment of any license tax imposed pursuant to this chapter, both the commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
(b)  If the commissioner ascertains that any license issuance fee or license tax has not been assessed for the current license year or any of the three (3) preceding license years or that the same has been assessed at less than the law requires, the commissioner shall assess the license issuance fee or license tax for such year or years at the rate or rates prescribed for that tax year or years. 
(c)  On and after January 1, 2003, pursuant to section 58.1-3703.1 A.4.b. and B.2., Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, if the commissioner ascertains that because of fraud or failure to apply for a license any license issuance fee or license tax has not been assessed for the current license year or any of the six (6) preceding license years or that the same has been assessed at less than the law requires, the commissioner shall assess the license issuance fee and license tax for such year or years at the rate or rates prescribed for that tax year or years. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to limit the commissioner's authority or duty to assess taxes which have not been assessed or have been assessed at less than the law requires as set forth in subsection (b) above. 
(d)  The period for collecting any local license issuance fee and license tax shall not expire prior to the period specified in section 58.1-3940, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended; two (2) years after the date of assessment if the period for assessment has been extended pursuant to this section; two (2) years after the final determination of an appeal for which collection has been stayed pursuant to section 19-32.1(b) or (d) of this chapter; or two (2) years after the final decision in a court application pursuant to section 58.1-3984[, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended,] or similar law for which collection has been stayed; whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 32959, § 1, 6-3-96) 
Sec. 19-23. - Validity of license dependent on payment of tax. 
    No license issued by the commissioner shall be valid or have any legal effect, except as an assessment, unless the tax prescribed by this chapter and shown on such license is paid to the treasurer, and the fact of such payment shall appear on the face of the license; provided, however, that an election to pay such tax in installments pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed, of itself, to invalidate such license. 
(Code 1956, Tit. VI, Ch. 8, § 11) 
Sec. 19-24. - Term of license; proration of tax. 
    Unless otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, all licenses shall be deemed to be issued for the current license year. No license issuance fee and license tax imposed by this chapter shall, upon issuance, be subject to proration for any portion of a license year, unless it be herein provided to the contrary, or unless such proration is required of localities by the general law. 
(Code 1956, Tit. VI, Ch. 8, § 20; Ord. No. 32959, § 2, 6-3-96) 
Sec. 19-25. - Refund of tax when business discontinued. 
(a)  When, subsequent to the issuance of any license under this chapter, the tax on which is measured by gross receipts, purchases, sales or any other basis set out and provided for in this chapter, the business, trade, profession, pursuit, vocation or calling so licensed is permanently, for any reason, discontinued upon surrender of the license so issued and upon timely written application made therefor, the amount of the license tax assessed on such license shall be apportioned and prorated by the commissioner on an annual basis, as of the date upon which such business permanently discontinued, and that part of the license tax apportioned to the part of the year following such discontinuance shall be abated and, if previously paid to the city, shall be refunded to the licensee or other party entitled thereto, provided: 
(1)  The licensee or his authorized agent or representative surrenders to the commissioner the business license issued and applicable to the location, business, trade, occupation, profession, pursuit or calling so discontinued; 
(2)  Written application by or on behalf of the licensee is made to the commissioner no later than the thirty-first (31st) day of January of the year next following the tax year for which any such license was issued, on forms prescribed by the city treasurer; and 
(3)  The licensee or his authorized agent or representative affirms, under oath, that the business, trade, occupation, profession, pursuit or calling shall not be prosecuted again during the then current tax year in any manner whatsoever, whether as a new business or as an outgrowth or continuation of such business under a new name, or as a result of corporate, partnership or other type of reorganization. 
(b)  No refund of any part of a license tax previously assessed shall be made under this section if, upon proration as provided for above, less than ten dollars ($10.00) of such license tax would be subject to abatement. 
(c)  Proration of license taxes as provided in this section shall be computed by the commissioner according to the ratio which the number of months, or parts thereof, such business, trade, occupation, profession or calling was not prosecuted during the current tax year bears to twelve (12) months.

Sec. 19-26. - Continuing business after expiration of license without obtaining new license. 
(a)  If any person shall continue a business, employment or profession after the expiration of a license previously issued therefor, without obtaining a new license, such person shall, if such failure to obtain a new license is continued for one (1) month, be subject to a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax assessable on such new license, in addition to the license tax imposed by this chapter, and such penalty shall be assessed and paid along with the license tax, or with the first installment thereof, if the same is paid in installments, and shall become a part of the license tax. Such penalty shall, in no case, be less than two dollars ($2.00). If such failure to obtain a new license is continued longer than one (1) month, such person shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than five dollars ($5.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  The taxes and penalty provided in this section shall be assessed against such person and collection thereof enforced in the manner provided by the law for the enforcement of the collection of other taxes. In such case, if such person shall, on demand, fail or refuse to file with the commissioner the information necessary to enable him to assess a license tax according to the basis provided by this chapter, the commissioner shall assess such license tax upon the best information he can obtain, adding thereto the prescribed penalty.

Sec. 19-30. - Taxpayer's records and audits. 
(a)  Every person who is assessable with a local license issuance fee and license tax shall keep sufficient records to enable the commissioner to verify the correctness of the tax paid for the license years assessable and to enable the commissioner to ascertain what is the correct amount of tax that was assessable for each of those years. These records shall include, but not be limited to, all invoices, records of all purchases and from whom made, records of all sales, records of all commissions, gross receipts, contracts and orders accepted and from whom received and with whom made, records of all sales, commissions, costs, receipts, contracts or orders accepted, and general books of account. All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be open to inspection and examination by the commissioner, license inspector, and deputy license inspector, to ascertain what is the correct amount of the tax that was assessable for each of those years. All such records, books of accounts and other information shall be open to inspection and examination by the commissioner in order to allow the commissioner to establish whether a particular receipt is directly attributable to the taxable privilege exercised within the city. These records shall also be open to inspection and examination by the director of finance, city treasurer, and any officer of the city charged in any manner with the duty of collecting license taxes. 
(b)  The commissioner shall provide the taxpayer with the option to conduct the audit in the taxpayer's local business office, if the records are maintained there. In the event the records are maintained outside the city, copies of the appropriate books and records shall be sent to the commissioner's office upon demand. 
(c)  Whenever it comes to the knowledge of the commissioner that a person liable for a license issuance fee or license tax has not kept, or is not keeping and preserving the records herein provided for. The commissioner shall proceed to estimate the probable business of such person to the best of his ability and assess such person with the license issuance fee and license tax provided by this chapter upon the business so estimated and, in addition, shall assess the penalty hereinafter provided for. 
(d)  Every person who shall fail or refuse to keep the records required by this section shall be assessed with and pay a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00), in addition to the license issuance fee and license tax imposed. Any person who shall continue to violate the provisions of this section requiring such records to be kept, after written notice from the commissioner, shall be subject to a further penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each month such violation shall continue after the giving of such notice, both of which penalties shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes are assessed and collected. 
(Code 1956, Tit. VI, Ch. 8, § 17; Ord. No. 32959, § 2, 6-3-96; Ord. No. 39658, § 1, 5-13-13) 
Sec. 19-31. - Commissioner's records and reports. 
    It shall be the duty of the commissioner to keep a record in which he shall classify all the branches of businesses and occupations upon which a license tax is imposed by this chapter, and show the amount of assessment made upon each license, the name of the person assessed and the period for which such license was issued. At the close of each month, he shall deliver to the director of finance and the city treasurer, a statement reporting the number of licenses issued and the amount of taxes paid under each classification, together with accumulative totals for the fiscal year ending June 30, comparative with the previous year, within fifteen (15) days of the end of the month.

Cross reference- Authority of director of finance to reduce or waive penalty and interest on delinquent taxes, § 2-238. 
Sec. 19-32.1. - Appeals and rulings. 
(a)  Any person assessed with a license tax as a result of an audit may apply within ninety (90) days from the date of such assessment to the commissioner for a correction of the assessment. The application must be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, audit period, remedy sought, each alleged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayer's contention. The commissioner may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and documents, a further audit, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the application. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. The commissioner shall undertake a full review of the taxpayer's claims and issue a determination to the taxpayer setting forth its position. Every assessment pursuant to an audit shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the taxpayer's right to seek correction and the specific procedure to be followed. This written explanation shall include the name and address to which such an application should be directed. 
(b)  Provided a timely and complete application is made, collection activity shall be suspended until a final determination is issued by the commissioner, unless the commissioner determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 19-20(g) of this chapter, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" includes a finding that the application is frivolous, or that a taxpayer desires to (i) depart quickly from the city, (ii) remove his property therefrom, (iii) conceal himself or his property therein, or (iv) do any other act tending to prejudice, or to render wholly or partially ineffectual, proceedings to collect the tax for the period in question. 
(c)  Any person assessed with a local license tax as a result of an audit may apply within ninety (90) days of the determination by the assessing official on an application pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to the tax commissioner for a correction of such assessment. The tax commissioner shall issue a determination to the taxpayer within ninety (90) days of receipt of the taxpayer's application, unless the taxpayer and the assessing official are notified that a longer period will be required. The application shall be treated as an application pursuant to section 58.1-1821, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, and the tax commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment pursuant to section 58.1-1822, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. Following such an order, either the taxpayer or the assessing official may apply to the appropriate circuit court pursuant to section 58.1-3984, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. However, the burden shall be on the party making the application to show that the ruling of the tax commissioner is erroneous. Neither the tax commissioner nor the department of taxation shall be made a party to an application to correct an assessment merely because the tax commissioner has ruled on it. 
(d)  On receipt of a notice of intent to file an appeal to the tax commissioner under subsection (c) of this section, the assessing official shall notify the treasurer and the city manager, or the city manager's designee of appeal. The treasurer shall suspend collection activity until a final determination is issued by the tax commissioner, unless the commissioner determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay or that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time. Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of section 19-20(g) of this chapter, but no further penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The term "jeopardized by delay" shall have the same meaning as set forth in subsection (b) above. 
(e)  Any taxpayer may request a written ruling regarding the application of a local license tax to a specific situation from the commissioner. Any person requesting such a ruling must provide all the relevant facts for the situation and may present a rationale for the basis of an interpretation of the law most favorable to the taxpayer. Any misrepresentation or change in the applicable law or the factual situation as presented in the ruling request shall invalidate any such ruling issued. A written ruling may be revoked or amended prospectively if (i) there is a change in the law, a court decision, or the guidelines issued by the department of taxation upon which the ruling was based or (ii) the commissioner notifies the taxpayer of a change in the policy or interpretation upon which the ruling was based. However, any person who acts on a written ruling which later becomes invalid shall be deemed to have acted in good faith during the period in which such ruling was in effect. 
(f)  The provision of this section relating to administrative and judicial review of an assessment shall be applicable to assessments made on and after January 1, 1997, even if for an earlier license year. 
(Ord. No. 32959, § 1, 6-3-96; Ord. No. 39658, § 1, 5-13-13; Ord. No. 40389, § 5, 11-16-15) 
Sec. 19-32.2. - Situs of gross receipts; general rule. 
(a)  Whenever the tax imposed by this chapter is measured by gross receipts, the gross receipts included in the taxable measure shall be only those gross receipts attributed to the exercise of a privilege subject to license at a definite place of business within the city. In the case of activities conducted outside of a definite place of business, such as during a visit to a customer location, the gross receipts shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which such activities are initiated, directed or controlled. The situs of gross receipts for different classifications of business shall be attributed to one (1) or more definite places of business or offices as follows: 
(1)  The gross receipts of a contractor shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which his services are performed, or if his services are not performed at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which his services are directed or controlled, unless the contractor is subject to the provisions of section 58.1-3715, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended; 
(2)  The gross receipts of a retailer or wholesaler shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which sales solicitation activities occur, or if sales solicitation activities do not occur at any definite place of business, then the definite place of business from which sales solicitation activities are directed or controlled; however, a wholesaler or distribution house subject to a license tax measured by purchases shall determine the situs of its purchases by the definite place of business at which or from which deliveries of the purchased goods, wares and merchandise are made to customers. Any wholesaler who is subject to license tax in the city and in another locality or other localities and who is subject to multiple taxation because the localities use different measures, may apply to the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Taxation for a determination as to the proper measure of purchases and gross receipts subject to license tax in each locality; 
(3)  The gross receipts of a business renting tangible personal property shall be attributed to the definite place of business from which the tangible personal property is rented or, if the property is not rented from any definite place of business, then to the definite place of business at which the rental of such property is managed; and 
(4)  The gross receipts from the performance of services shall be attributed to the definite place of business at which the services are performed or, if not performed at any definite place of business, then to the definite place of business from which the services are directed or controlled. 
(Ord. No. 32959, § 1, 6-3-96) 
Sec. 19-32.3. - Apportionment of gross receipts and agreements. 
(a)  If a licensee has more than one (1) definite place of business and it is impractical or impossible to determine to which definite place of business gross receipts should be attributed under the general rule, the gross receipts of the business shall be apportioned between the definite places of businesses on the basis of payroll. Gross receipts shall not be apportioned to a definite place of business unless some activities under the applicable general rule occurred at, or were controlled from such definite place of business. Gross receipts attributable to a definite place of business outside of the city shall not be attributed to the city solely because the other jurisdiction does not impose a tax on the gross receipts attributable to the definite place of business in such other jurisdiction. 
(b)  The commissioner may enter into agreements with any other political subsection of Virginia concerning the manner in which gross receipts shall be apportioned among definite places of business. However, the sum of the gross receipts apportioned by the agreement shall not exceed the total gross receipts attributable to all of the definite places of business affected by the agreement. Upon being notified by a taxpayer that its method of attributing gross receipts is fundamentally inconsistent with the method of one (1) or more political subsections in which the taxpayer is licensed to engage in business and that the difference has, or is likely to, result in taxes on more than one hundred (100) percent of its gross receipts from all locations in the affected jurisdictions, the commissioner shall make a good faith effort to reach an apportionment agreement with the other political subsections involved. If an agreement cannot be reached either the commissioner or taxpayer may seek an advisory opinion from the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Taxation pursuant to section 58.1-3701, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. Notice of the request shall be given to the other party. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 58.1-3993, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, when a taxpayer has demonstrated to a court that two (2) or more political subdivisions of Virginia have assessed taxes on gross receipts that may create a double assessment within the meaning of section 58.1-3986, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, the court shall enter such orders pending resolution of the litigation as may be necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is not required to pay multiple assessments even though it is not then known which assessment is correct and which is erroneous.

(Code 1956, Tit. XVIII, Ch. 1, § 36) 
Sec. 20-28. - Tax imposed. 
    An annual license tax is hereby imposed on the motor vehicles, trailers and semitrailers listed below and operating within the city as follows: 
(a)  Twenty eight dollars ($28.00) for each passenger vehicle and truck under ten thousand (10,000) pounds gross vehicle weight rating, and including motor homes, provided such passenger vehicle or motor home is not kept or used for rent or for hire, or is not operated under a lease without a chauffeur. 
(b)  Thirty dollars ($30.00) for each private passenger vehicle or motor home, that has a gross vehicle weight rating of ten thousand (10,000) pounds or over, if such passenger vehicle or motor home is not used for the transportation of passengers for compensation and is not kept or used for rent or for hire or is not operated under a lease without chauffeur. 
(c)  Twenty dollars ($20.00) for taxicabs and other vehicles kept for rent or hire operated with a chauffeur for the transportation of passengers, which operate, or should operate pursuant to permits issued by the state corporation commission as required by law, if such vehicle weighs under ten thousand (10,000) pounds gross vehicle weight rating. In the event such vehicle weighs ten thousand (10,000) pounds gross vehicle weight rating or above, the tax will be twenty eight dollars ($28.00). This subsection does not apply to vehicles used as common carriers. 
(d)  Twenty dollars ($20.00) for each trailer or semitrailer designed for use as living quarters for human beings, which trailers shall include, but not be limited to, camping trailers. 
(e)  Fifteen dollars ($15.00) for a motorcycle, with or without a sidecar. 
(f)  Twenty dollars ($20.00) for a bus used exclusively for transportation to and from Sunday school or church, for the purpose of divine worship regardless of gross vehicle weight rating. 
(g)  Twenty dollars ($20.00) for all school buses, regardless of gross vehicle weight rating. 
(h)  Thirty dollars ($30.00) for other passenger-carrying vehicles, trailers and semitrailers. This subsection does not apply to vehicles used as common carriers. 
(i)  The gross vehicle weight rating shall be used for computing all taxes required by this article to be based upon the weight of the vehicle. For purposes of this article, the term "gross vehicle weight rating" shall mean the manufacturer's maximum rated capacity of a vehicle, including the weight of the base vehicle, all added equipment, driver and passengers, and cargo. 
(j)  The applicant for a license bears the burden of proof that the vehicle for which the license is sought is entitled by weight, design and use to be licensed at the tax tendered by the applicant. 
(k)  The license taxes required by this Code to be paid for the operation of motor vehicles used for rent or hire shall not be required for the operation of any motor vehicle with a normal seating capacity of not more than twelve (12) adult persons including the driver (i) while used not for profit in transporting persons who, as a common undertaking, bear or agree to bear all or a part of the actual costs of such operation, or (ii) while used by a lessee renting or hiring such vehicle for a period of twelve (12) months or longer under a written lease or agreement. Every other motor vehicle leased under a lease or agreement of twelve (12) months or more shall be treated as a private motor vehicle for which the annual license tax shall be as set forth in subsection 20-28(a) or (b) of this chapter as applicable. (l) The license taxes to be paid by the owners of all motor vehicles not designed and used for the transportation of passengers shall be determined by reference to the gross vehicle weight rating of the vehicle or combination of vehicles of which it is a part, and according to the provisions of this article. 
The tax for a pickup or panel truck shall be twenty eight dollars ($28.00) if the gross vehicle weight rating is under ten thousand (10,000) pounds and thirty dollars ($30.00) if such vehicle is ten thousand (10,000) pounds or more. 
In the case of a combination of a truck or tractor truck and a trailer or semitrailer, each vehicle constituting a part of such combination shall be taxed as a separate vehicle, but, for the purpose of determining the gross vehicle weight rating group into which any such vehicle falls, the combination of vehicles of which such vehicle constitutes a part shall be considered a unit, and the aggregate gross vehicle weight rating of the entire combination shall determine such gross vehicle weight group. 
(m)  The license tax to be paid by the owner of a one-wheel or two-wheel trailer of a cradle, flatbed or open pickup type which has a body width not greater than the width of the motor vehicle to which it is attached at any time of operation, which is pulled or towed by a passenger car or station wagon, or a pickup or panel truck having an actual gross vehicle weight rating not exceeding five thousand (5,000) pounds, and which is used for carrying property not exceeding one thousand five hundred (1,500) pounds at any one (1) time, and for all trailers designed exclusively to transport boats shall be six dollars and fifty cents ($6.50). In the event such trailer has an actual gross vehicle weight rating more than one thousand five hundred (1,500) pounds and less than ten thousand (10,000) pounds, the license tax shall be twenty dollars ($20.00). The license tax shall be thirty dollars ($30.00) if the trailer has an actual gross vehicle weight rating of ten thousand (10,000) pounds and above. Nothing herein shall be construed as applying to the fees for trailers or semitrailers designed for use as living quarters for human beings, or to those trailers or semitrailers operated under lease or rental agreement, or operated for compensation. 
(n)  Notwithstanding the provisions above, upon receipt of an application on a form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue and receipt of written evidence from one (1) of the armed forces that an applicant for the annual motor vehicle license was a prisoner of war and was honorably discharged, if not currently a member of the armed forces, the annual motor vehicle license shall be issued with no tax being assessed. Issuance of such free license shall be limited to passenger vehicles and pickup or panel trucks as defined in Code of Virginia, § 46.2-100. No individual shall be issued a free license under this subsection for more than one (1) vehicle. Any person who is not a person described in this subsection and who willfully and falsely represents himself or herself as having the qualifications to obtain the free annual license shall be guilty of a traffic infraction punishable by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(o)  Notwithstanding the provisions above, the motor vehicle license tax for an antique motor vehicle, as defined in and licensed pursuant to Code of Virginia, Title 46.2, shall be a one-time tax of five dollars ($5.00). In order to qualify for such rate, owners of such vehicles must file an application therefor with the commissioner of revenue upon such forms as prescribed by the commissioner. Such license shall remain in effect for such period of time as the antique motor vehicle is titled in the name of the applicant. 
(p)  Notwithstanding the provisions above, there shall be no license tax for mopeds, autocycles, and vehicles with a gross weight exceeding ten thousand (10,000) pounds owned by museums officially designated by the Commonwealth. 
(q)  No provisions under this section shall be construed as imposing a license tax or fee on any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer in excess of the amounts authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

    The following terms shall, for the purposes of this article, have the meanings set forth below: 
    Inoperable motor vehicle means any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer which is not in operating condition; or does not display valid license plates or does not display an inspection decal that is valid or does display an inspection decal that has been expired for more than sixty (60) days. 
    Motor vehicle, as defined in § 46.2-100, Code of Virginia, means every vehicle which is self-propelled or designed for self-propulsion, unless otherwise provided in Title 46.2, Code of Virginia. Any structure designed, used or maintained primarily to be loaded or affixed to a motor vehicle to provide a mobile dwelling, sleeping place, office, or commercial space shall be considered a part of a motor vehicle. Bicycles and mopeds shall not be deemed to be a motor vehicle. 
    Semitrailer, as defined in § 46.2-100, Code of Virginia, means every vehicle of the trailer type so designed and used in conjunction with a motor vehicle that some of its own weight and that of its own load rests or is carried by another vehicle. 
    Shielded or screened from view means not visible by someone standing at ground level from outside of the property on which a subject vehicle is located. Placing an inoperable vehicle within an area completely enclosed by either a solid, rigid, opaque fence composed of standard fencing materials or a landscaped arrangement of non-deciduous trees, sufficient in height, spacing, density and circumference to ensure precluding visibility of the subject vehicle by someone standing at ground level from outside of the property on which the subject vehicle is located shall constitute shielding or screening from view the inoperable motor vehicle in compliance with the requirements of this article. The placing, draping or securing of a tarpaulin or other nonrigid cover over or around an inoperable vehicle shall not be sufficient to comply with the requirements of this article. 
    Trailer, as defined in § 46.2-100, Code of Virginia, means every vehicle without motive power designed for carrying property or passengers wholly on its own structure and for being drawn by a motor vehicle, including mobile homes.

Therefore, this section shall not apply to any property zoned and used as light industrial (I-1) and heavy industrial (I-2), because all other zoning districts within the city except for light industrial (I-1) and heavy industrial (I-2) permit residential, agricultural or commercial uses by right. 
(b)  The provision of this article shall not apply to a licensed business which is regularly engaged in business as an automobile dealer, salvage dealer or scrap processor.

Sec. 21-56. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section: 
    Gambling device. A gambling device includes: 
(1)  Any device, machine, paraphernalia, equipment or other thing, including books, records and other papers, which are actually used in an illegal gambling operation or activity; and 
(2)  Any machine, apparatus, implement, instrument, contrivance, board or other thing, including but not limited to those dependent upon the insertion of a coin or other object for their operation, which operates, either completely automatically or with the aid of some physical act by the player or operator, in such a manner that, depending upon elements of chance, it may eject something of value or determine the prize or other thing of value to which the player is entitled; provided, that the return to the user of nothing more than additional chances or the right to use such machine is not deemed something of value; and provided further, that machines that only sell or entitle the user to items of merchandise of equivalent value that may differ from each other in composition, size, shape or color shall not be deemed gambling devices. 
    Such devices are no less gambling devices if they indicate beforehand the definite result of one (1) or more operations but not all the operations, nor are they any less gambling devices because, apart from their use or adaptability as such, they may also sell or deliver something of value on a basis other than chance. 
    Illegal gambling. The making, placing or receipt of any bet or wager in this city of money or other thing of value, made in exchange for a chance to win a prize, stake or other consideration or thing of value, dependent upon the result of any game, contest or any other event the outcome of which is uncertain or a matter of chance, whether such game, contest or event occurs or is to occur inside or outside the limits of this city, shall constitute illegal gambling.

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL 

Sec. 22.3-1. - Preamble. 
    On August 30, 1926, the City of Roanoke established its first retirement system covering employees of the fire and police departments (fire and police system). Effective July 1, 1946, another pension plan, the employees' retirement system (ERS), was established to cover employees of the fire and police departments, as well as other employees of the city. The fire and police system covered only those fire and police employees of the city whose date of hire was on or before December 31, 1945. The fire and police system shall exist until such time as all payments promised to its covered retirees and beneficiaries have been made, and no other liabilities for payment exist. Those retirees and beneficiaries of the fire and police system shall remain under the terms and conditions of the fire and police system. 
    The employees' retirement system (ERS) has been amended from time to time in order to increase retirement benefits, eliminate mandatory employee contributions, and voluntarily comply with certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
    By Ordinance No. 27061, adopted on June 18, 1984, city council amended and restated the ERS effective July 1, 1984. The ERS was replaced for certain active members by the employees' supplemental retirement system (ESRS) which covers employees of participating employers (1) who voluntarily elected to cease membership in the ERS and begin participation in the ESRS, and (2) new employees of participating employers whose date of hire or rehire is on or after July 1, 1984. ESRS did not affect the rights of any current beneficiaries as of June 30, 1984. 
    The fire and police system, ERS and ESRS shall share one (1) common trust fund from which all benefits shall be paid without distinction as to the source of the funds and which shall be administered by one (1) board of trustees. 
    By Ordinance No. 35880, adopted on May 20, 2002, city council amended and restated the pensions and retirement chapter generally effective June 1, 2002. Certain provisions had retroactive effective dates as indicated in the text in order to comply with federal tax laws. The purpose of that amendment and restatement was to assure compliance with federal tax laws and to streamline the administration of the benefits provided under this chapter. Nothing in the amendment and restatement of the pensions and retirement chapter decreased creditable service or earnable compensation under the terms of the chapter as it existed prior to its amendment and restatement. 
    By Ordinance No. 39450, adopted on July 16, 2012, city council amends and restates the pensions and retirement chapter generally effective July 16, 2012. Certain provisions have retroactive effective dates as indicated in the text in order to comply with federal tax laws. The purpose of the amendment is to establish an Internal Revenue Code Section 401(h) retirement health savings account within the pension plan, effective July 1, 2013, as well as new tiers of benefits within the employees' supplemental retirement system (ESRS) and a defined contribution plan, effective July 1, 2014. Nothing in this amendment and restatement of the pensions and retirement chapter shall decrease creditable service or earnable compensation under the terms of the chapter as it existed prior to its amendment and restatement. 
    The fire and police system, ERS and ESRS shall hereafter collectively be referred to as the City of Roanoke Pension Plan (city plan).

(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-26.1. - Establishment of 401(h) account, contributions, investment and use. 
(a)  There is hereby established a 401(h) account which shall be a separate account within the trust fund of the plan and which is established pursuant to Section 401(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The system shall separately account for the funds contributed to the 401(h) account by members and by each participating employer and the earnings and expenses relating to the investment and administration of those funds. The trustees shall not be obligated to commingle the 401(h) account assets for investment but instead shall segregate such funds into a subtrust and accounted for such assets on a member account level. Members shall be permitted to direct the investment of the member level account in accordance with procedures and within the parameters established by the board. The authority to contract on behalf of the board with an investment provider to administer the participant level accounts and investment direction is delegated to the defined contribution board. 
(b)  Effective July 1, 2013, each member who is employed by the city or any participating employer that elects pursuant to subsection (j) to participate in the 401(h) account, including a police officer, a firefighter and a hybrid member, shall contribute one (1) percent of his earnable compensation each pay period to the 401(h) account. Such contribution shall be credited to the 401(h) account and accounted for in a separate member level account. The member contributions, although designated as employee contributions hereunder, will be paid by the participating employers and shall be treated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and shall not be included as gross income of the employee until such time as they are distributed or made available to the employee. The city shall "pick-up" the employee contributions by reducing the amount payable to each employee by the amount of his required employee contribution on a salary reduction basis. Any other participating employer shall "pick-up" the employee contributions either in lieu of future salary increases or by reducing the amount payable to each employee by the amount of his required employee contribution on a salary reduction basis, as indicated by such participating employer in the authorization passed by its governing body. 
(c)  Effective July 1, 2013, each participating employer that elects pursuant to subsection (j) to participate in the 401(h) account shall contribute one (1) percent of earnable compensation on behalf of each person who becomes a member after June 30, 2013, and each other member who elects pursuant to section 22.3-61 to forego the supplement described therein. Such contribution shall be credited to the 401(h) account and accounted for in a separate member level account. If the member ceases to be an employee prior to accumulating at least five (5) years of creditable service, the funds held in the member level 401(h) account attributable to the employer contribution and the earnings thereon shall be forfeited. Forfeitures of the employer contributions and the earnings thereon shall be used to pay expenses of the 401(h) account or to reduce future contributions required by the employer, as determined by the defined contribution board. 
(d)  Contributions to the 401(h) account must be subordinated to the contributions to the plan for retirement benefits. Accordingly at all times the aggregate contribution by the participating employer (made after June 30, 2013) to fund the 401(h) account and to furnish any life insurance protections shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total aggregate actual contribution made by the participating employer (made after June 30, 2013) to the plan (excluding any contributions to fund the purchase of past service credited). For this purpose: 1) life insurance protection includes benefits paid under the plan on behalf of members as a result of such member's death to the extent the payment exceeds the amount of the reserve to provide retirement benefits for the member existing at his death; and 2) contributions made by participating employers to the plan include contributions that have been properly picked up under Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. The board shall determine annually whether the twenty-five (25) percent test has been met. If at any time the 401(h) account contributions exceed the limitation that participant employer will be notified immediately and the excess amount not accepted. Any affected participating employer shall immediately give the board direction as to the disposition of the excess contributions. 
(e)  After a member ceases to be an employee, such member may request reimbursement from his separate account in the 401(h) account for medical care expenses as defined in Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code (to the extent such expenses are not otherwise reimbursed by insurance) after proper substantiation has been provided, first from the portion of the member account attributable to the member contributions and the investment earnings thereon and only after that has been exhausted, from the portion of the account attributable to the participating employer's contributions and the investment earnings thereon. 
(f)  Such member's spouse and dependent children may continue to request reimbursement for such medical care expenses after the member's death. 
(g)  Following the death of such member's spouse and after the death of all dependent children of the members or, if earlier, the last dependent ceasing to be a dependent, any remaining funds in the 401(h) account of such member shall be forfeited. The forfeiture shall apply to reduce the future contributions by the participating employer to fund the 401(h) account. 
(h)  The defined contribution board is authorized to contract with a third party to provide recordkeeping services to the plan for the member level 401(h) accounts and to provide claims processing services in connection with the payment of reimbursements for the 401(h) account. 
(i)  The board and defined contribution board shall establish more detailed guidelines for the maintenance and use of the 401(h) account consistent with the requirements of Section 401(h) of the Internal Revenue Code and consistent with the provisions of this section. 
(j)  Prior to July 1, 2013, a participating employer may elect to participate in the 401(h) account by action of its governing body which action shall include the approval of the "pick-up" arrangements and shall be effective as of a July 1, 2013, on a prospective basis.

The city shall "pick-up" the employee contributions by reducing the amount payable to each employee by the amount of his required employee contribution on a salary reduction basis.

(e)  The total amount payable by each participating employer in each year shall be sufficient, when combined with the assets of the system, to provide the benefits payable to members and beneficiaries then current. 
(f)  For valuation purposes the value of the assets must reflect current market value as of June 30 of each year, however, unrealized gains and losses or appreciation/depreciation may be phased in over a period of time at the board's discretion. 
(g)  The actuary shall show separately the cost for each of the systems and, if requested by the board, shall separate the cost of the deputized police officers and firefighters from all other employees within each system, and, if requested by the board, shall show separately the cost for each participating employer. 
(h)  All reasonable administrative expenses shall be paid from the trust. 
(i)  The board shall file with the city manager and the governing body of each additional participating employer its certification of the amount of appropriations necessary to pay the required contribution as certified by the city plan's actuary and such amount shall be included in the participating employer's budget in accordance with budget procedure. 
(j)  All member contributions and interest allowances shall be credited to the member contribution account.

Sec. 22.3-29. - Election of benefit under ERS or ESRS for members of ESRS having forty-two (42) or more years of creditable service. 
    Any member of the ERS on June 30, 1984, who subsequently elected to transfer to ESRS and who thereafter attains forty-two (42) or more years of creditable service shall have his accrued benefit at the time of retirement calculated pursuant to the terms of ERS and ESRS, and such member shall elect to be paid his accrued benefit under either ERS or ESRS prior to the commencement of payment of any benefits under the city plan.

(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-31. - Restoration of beneficiaries to membership. 
(a)  Should a disability beneficiary under normal retirement age be restored to or be in service at a compensation equal to or greater than his average final compensation at retirement (adjusted by any cost of living adjustments granted since his last day of service), or should any other beneficiary be restored to service prior to his normal retirement age, his pension shall cease and he shall become a member of ESRS. Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any prior service certificate on the basis of which his creditable service was computed at the time of his retirement shall be restored to full force and effect and he shall be credited with all creditable service as a member standing to his credit at the time of his retirement; provided, however, that upon his subsequent retirement, the pension shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any pension payments previously paid to him for reasons other than disability retirement; and further provided, that his pension attributable to his creditable service prior to his reemployment upon subsequent retirement shall be no less than the sum of his previous pension plus the amount computed on the basis of his creditable service and earnable compensation for the period after his restoration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such restoration of service occurs after June 30, 2014, he shall be treated as a new member and a person who becomes a member after June 30, 2014; except that prior creditable service shall be restored in accordance with section 22.3-35 and for the limited purpose described therein. 
(b)  Should any beneficiary be restored to service on or after his normal retirement age, the pension shall be discontinued during the period of restoration, and he shall become a member of the ESRS but in the event of his death during such period any payment under an optional benefit, if one (1) has been elected and has become effective with respect to his retirement allowance attributable to his creditable service prior to his reemployment, shall commence. Such a member shall be considered a new member with respect to service rendered subsequent to his restoration; except that his normal retirement age shall be the same as before restoration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such restoration of service occurs after June 30, 2014, he shall be treated as a new member and a person who becomes a member after June 30, 2014; except that prior creditable service shall be restored in accordance with section 22.3-35 and for the limited purpose described therein. 
(c)  If a former employee who is entitled to a deferred early service retirement allowance or a deferred vested allowance returns to service as an eligible employee of a participating employer before such allowance has become payable, he shall become a member of the ESRS upon his return, and his retirement allowance attributable to his creditable service prior to his reemployment and payable on subsequent retirement shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this article in effect at such time on the basis of service standing to his credit at the time of his termination and service credited to him after his return. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such restoration of service occurs after June 30, 2014, he shall be treated as a new member and a person who becomes a member after June 30, 2014; except that prior creditable service shall be restored in accordance with section 22.3-35 and for the limited purpose described therein. 
(d)  Any member who is reemployed by a participating employer shall not have his pension attributable to his creditable service prior to his reemployment reduced below the level he was receiving or was eligible to receive prior to reemployment. This requirement applies both to the creditable service used to determine the amount of pension and eligibility for receiving payment. 
(e)  Should any beneficiary receiving a pension be elected a member of city council, such beneficiary upon his initial election to city council, may make an irrevocable election to: 
(1)  Discontinue receiving such pension pursuant to the provisions of section 22.3-31(b) above, and accrue additional creditable service for serving on city council; or 
(2)  Continue to receive a pension, but forego the accrual of additional creditable service for serving on city council.

    Creditable service means membership service plus prior service. 
    Membership service shall mean service as a member for which credit is allowable as provided in sections 22.3-37 and 22.3-40 and service which is otherwise expressly credited as membership service pursuant to sections 22.3-41, 22.3-33, 22.3-38 and 22.3-39. 
    Prior service shall mean service rendered prior to becoming a member for which credit is allowable as provided in sections 22.3-35, 22.3-74, and 22.3-41. 
    Prior service certificate shall mean a certificate issued by the board of trustees granting prior service. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-33. - Service credit during leaves of absence. 
(a)  No service credit shall be allowed for any period of thirty (30) or more days during which an employee was absent without pay; provided, however, any period of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 shall be treated as membership service for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate (but not for the accrual of additional benefits). 
(b)  Periods for which an eligible employee is receiving workers' compensation shall also be treated as membership service for purposes of vesting and eligibility (but not for the accrual of additional benefits). Such workers' compensation related periods shall be credited upon the eligible employee's return to service. 
(c)  For a member who has unused extended illness leave pursuant to section 2-55 of the City of Roanoke Code, or pursuant to the administrative process set by the Roanoke Valley Regional Airport Commission, seventy-five (75) percent of such member's unused extended illness leave balance upon the date of retirement shall be converted to creditable service not to exceed one (1) year of creditable service; provided no member shall use conversion of extended illness leave to meet vesting requirements of ESRS or ERS; no retirement allowance for any member converting extended illness to creditable service shall exceed sixty-three (63) percent of average final compensation; and such member must begin receiving a retirement allowance immediately upon termination from employment. The service credit described in this section shall not be granted to members who are employees of the city school board or the Roanoke Valley Resource Authority. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-34. - Prorated creditable service for less than full-time work. 
    Effective for creditable service earned after July 1, 2006, in the case of a member whose regular work schedule is less than that of an employee considered to be full-time under the participating employer's personnel policies (other than members of city council), creditable service shall be a fraction of a year based on the number of hours in the member's regular work schedule over the number of hours in the regular work schedule of an employee considered to be full-time under the participating employer's personnel policies. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-35. - Restoration of prior creditable service. 
    If a member is hired by a participating employer, prior creditable service (if any) will be reinstated when the following conditions are met: 
(a)  The member, other than a member of city council, shall work one (1) continuous year after returning as an eligible employee before qualifying for prior creditable service; except when such person dies or becomes disabled after returning to service with a participating employer, in which case he shall become entitled to credit for prior creditable service as of the date of such death or disability without having to meet the requirement of one (1) year of continuous service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the member is hired by a participating employer after June 30, 2014, such prior creditable service shall be applied only for purposes of determining eligibility for the post-retirement supplement described in section 22.3-61.1 and for determining vesting and normal retirement age with respect to benefits attributable to future service. The accrued benefit attributable to pre-July 1, 2014, creditable service shall be determined in accordance with section 22.3-31. If the member did not have a vested allowance attributable to his pre-July 1, 2014, creditable service, his post-June 30, 2014, creditable service shall count toward the years of creditable service required for a vested allowance attributable to pre-July 1, 2014, creditable service. Notwithstanding, however, the retirement allowance based on such pre-July 1, 2014, service shall be determined based on the provisions applicable to a person who becomes a member after June 30, 2014. 
(b)  If the member received a refund of his accumulated contributions or a lump sum distribution for the full value of his pension previously earned and he repays the entire amount of the refund or distribution with interest, at the rate of five (5) percent per annum compounded, within ninety (90) days after reemployment, his prior credited service shall be reinstated for all purposes. Notwithstanding, however, the retirement allowance based on such pre-July 1, 2014, service shall be determined based on the provisions applicable to a person who becomes a member after June 30, 2014. Such repayment may be made by plan-to-plan transfer, rollover or after-tax contribution. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-36. - Service generally. 
    Except as provided in section 22.3-28 and section 22.3-35, a member shall be entitled to creditable service, for purposes of calculating retirement benefits, for all time such member was an eligible employee, as defined in section 22.3-2, whether such service was continuous or not and regardless of breaks or interruptions in such service with any participating employer. No member shall, except as required in section 22.3-74, be allowed creditable service for time during which such member was not an eligible employee of a participating employer.

Sec. 22.3-38. - Portability. 
(a)  The board may enter into an agreement with the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) or another political subdivision of the commonwealth having a defined benefit plan which is not supplemental to the Virginia Retirement System, whereby any vested ESRS member may be granted creditable service, as determined by the board, for service rendered with the VRS or with another political subdivision upon the transfer of assets pursuant to the agreement and in accordance with the procedures established by the board. In no event will creditable service be granted in excess of the actual service rendered with the VRS or other political subdivision. 
(b)  The board may transfer assets on behalf of a vested member to the VRS pursuant to the agreement between the board and the Virginia Retirement System. 
(c)  The board may transfer assets on behalf of a vested member to a defined benefit plan of another political subdivision of the commonwealth which is not supplemental to the VRS pursuant to the agreement between the board and such other political subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12; Ord. No. 39969, § 3, 7-16-14) 
Sec. 22.3-39. - Purchase of service. 
(a)  Creditable service for purposes of this article shall also include service purchased by an ESRS member pursuant to this section and in accordance with the procedures established by the board. Upon completion of a service purchase described herein, the board of trustees, or its delegate, shall issue a prior service certificate relating to the purchased service. 
(b)  Any member in service who has been credited with five (5) or more years of creditable service or who will become vested as a result of the current purchased service may, pursuant to the procedures described in subsections (d) or (e), purchase creditable service for all or part of the following: 
(1)  Certified creditable service with a retirement system with which the city has entered into a portability agreement pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 22.3-38 and section 51.1-801.1, Code of Virginia. 
(2)  Service with the city in a grant position prior to July 1, 2000. 
The member must pay an amount equal to a percentage of the member's present annualized earnable compensation or his average final compensation during his thirty-six (36) or sixty (60) highest consecutive months of creditable service (as determined pursuant to section 22.3-42). The percentage of present earnable compensation or average earnable compensation, whichever is greater, to be charged shall be determined by the city plan's actuary based on reasonable factors and assumptions approved by the board of trustees intended to reflect the actual cost to the city plan of the benefit to be provided as a result of the purchased service. If the member does not pay the entire amount required, the member's actual creditable service shall be prorated on a linear basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the member does not pay the entire amount required due to the member's death while an employee and such member does not have sufficient creditable service to be entitled to a death benefit under section 22.3-67, then the amount paid by the member to purchase service shall be refunded to the member's spouse or if none, to the member's estate as soon as possible following the date of the member's death. 
(c)  No service may be purchased under this section if such service is considered in the calculation of any retirement benefit either under this chapter as a result of portability or by another retirement system. 
(d)  Upon an election by a member to purchase creditable service pursuant to this section and the receipt by the participating employer of a binding and irrevocable salary reduction election executed by the member on a form provided by the board for this purpose, the participating employer shall pay to the city plan an equivalent amount in lieu of the member's contribution required to purchase creditable service pursuant to this section. The member shall not be given the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the participating employer to the city plan. Such election shall not be effective prior to the receipt of the signed election. Contributions made by the participating employers pursuant to this section shall be considered earnable compensation for purposes of this chapter. Such contributions shall be paid to the trust fund by the participating employer from the same source of funds as used in paying the wages to affected members. Creditable service available for purchase that is not purchased using the procedure described in this subsection may be purchased using the procedure described in subsection (e). 
(e)  In lieu of the purchase by salary reduction election as described in subsection (d) or in addition thereto, the city plan shall accept a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer of a lump sum in cash from a plan established pursuant to Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by a governmental employer or a plan or program established pursuant to Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended as payment by a member for the purchase of creditable service described in subsection (b). Creditable service purchased with the lump sum shall be determined by dividing the lump sum by the applicable percentage described in subsection (b) multiplied by the greater of the member's present annualized earnable compensation or his average final compensation during his thirty-six (36) or sixty (60) highest consecutive months of creditable service (as determined pursuant to section 22.3-42). Creditable service available for purchase that is not purchased using the procedure described in this subsection, may be purchased using the procedure described in subsection (d).

Sec. 22.3-41. - Prior service credit generally. 
    Service prior to July 1, 1946, for employees whose date of hire was before July 1, 1946, shall be based upon the prior service certificate, the employee's statement of all service as an employee rendered by him prior to said date for which he claims credit, whether continuous or not, and of such other facts as the board may require for the proper operation of the system. The board shall fix and determine, by appropriate rules and regulations, the amount of service in any year which is equivalent to a year of service, but in no case shall more than one (1) year of service be creditable for all service in one (1) calendar year, nor shall the board allow credit as service for any period of more than one (1) month's duration during which the employee was absent without pay. The board shall verify, as soon as practicable after the filing of such statements of service, the service therein claimed, and shall issue prior service certificates certifying to each member the number of years of prior service with which he is credited. As long as membership continues, a prior service certificate shall be final and conclusive for retirement purposes as to such prior service credit; provided, however, that any member may, within one (1) year after the date of issuance or modification of such certificate, request the board to modify or correct his prior service certificate.

The disability retirement allowance of a hybrid member shall be offset by the actuarial equivalent of his account in the defined contribution plan as of the effective date of his disability. 
(d)  Should the member die while receiving a nonoccupational disability retirement allowance, any excess accumulated contribution as of the effective date of the member's retirement, over the total retirement allowance previously received by him will be paid to the member's beneficiary.

Sec. 22.3-52. - Application for workers' compensation benefits required. 
    As a condition precedent to application for an occupational disability benefit from the city plan, a member must first apply for workers' compensation benefits and be awarded such benefits. Receipt of an award under the Workers' Compensation Act shall not relieve an applicant of the duty to prove his qualification for a benefit under the standards established by this chapter for the city plan. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-53. - Workers' compensation benefits offset against retirement benefits.

(b)  In the case of a member, beneficiary or dependent of a member or beneficiary who elects to receive a lump sum settlement in lieu of periodic payments for temporary disability or death compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, the retirement allowance shall cease or be reduced, as the case may be. The amount of reduction shall be determined by the workers' compensation benefit which such person would have received had the lump sum settlement not been consummated, including all cost of living adjustments permitted by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission, and had such person received periodic payments for disability or death for the maximum amount of time otherwise permitted under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act. The reduction shall continue each month for a period of months, until such time as the total amount of periodic payments for disability or death payable to such person under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act would have been offset had the lump sum settlement not been consummated. 
(c)  The above notwithstanding, no amount paid or payable under the provisions of the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, or any similar law, to any member or beneficiary, or to the dependents of any member or beneficiary, on account of permanent partial disability from any injury, shall be offset against any benefits payable out of funds under the provisions of the city plan.

Such examination shall be made by a medical examiner at the examiner's office during normal business hours. For this purpose, the secretary-treasurer shall select a medical examiner or examiners who are located within a reasonable proximity of the member's place of residence. Should any disability beneficiary refuse to submit to such medical examination, his retirement allowance may be discontinued by the board until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should his refusal continue for one (1) year, all his rights in and to his pension may be revoked by the board. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-56. - Modification of disability retirement allowances. 
(a)  Should the board find that any disability beneficiary is engaged in or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his pension and his average final compensation adjusted pursuant to any applicable amendments to the ranges of the participating employer's pay plan subsequent to the member's retirement, the board shall reduce the amount which, together with the amount earnable by him, shall equal the amount of his average final compensation adjusted as provided above. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary from any gainful occupation be later changed, the amount of his pension may be further modified in a like manner. 
(b)  The board or the secretary-treasurer of the city plan, upon the authority of the board, shall be authorized to make such inquiries of persons who are disability beneficiaries under the city plan as are necessary to determine whether any such person is engaged or is able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his pension and his average final compensation increased by the average cost of living allowances to city employees. Such inquiries shall be answered under oath. Any disability beneficiary may also be required to produce copies of tax returns and tax withholding forms (W-2s) to establish income. If any disability beneficiary should refuse or fail to provide the information required by this section, the board shall be authorized to terminate such person's benefits until compliance is achieved.

    Any such direction shall be filed with the board in such form and at such time as the board may require and shall adequately specify the eligible retirement plan to which the payment shall be made. The board shall make payment as directed only if the proposed transferee plan will accept the payment. Any such plan-to-plan transfer shall be considered a distribution option under this plan and shall be subject to all the usual distribution rules of the city plan (including, but not limited to, the requirement of an advance explanation of the option). The board is authorized in its discretion, on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis, to apply any discretionary de minimis or other discretionary exceptions or limitations provided for under Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in affecting or declining to affect plan-to-plan transfers hereunder. Within a reasonable time (generally not more than ninety (90) nor less than thirty (30) days) before the benefit payment date of a prospective recipient of an eligible rollover distribution from the plan, the board shall provide the prospective recipient with a written explanation of the rollover and tax rules required by Section 402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
    If a refund is paid pursuant to section 22.3-62.1 that exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and the member has not attained the later of his normal retirement age or the age of sixty-two (62), the refund shall be made by the board's paying the distribution directly to an "eligible retirement plan" which is an individual retirement plan in a direct rollover to the individual retirement plan on behalf of the member (an "automatic rollover"), unless the member requests in writing that the distribution be made directly to him (as opposed to a rollover to an "eligible retirement plan") or directs in writing that the distribution be made to a specified "eligible retirement plan" or plans. The automatic rollover shall be made to an individual retirement plan that satisfies the safe harbor, therefore section 51.1-124.30.F, Code of Virginia, and such provisions shall be interpreted and administered in accordance therewith.

DIVISION 2. - ESRS 

Sec. 22.3-62. - Optional spousal allowance. 
    Until the effective date of retirement, any member may elect to convert the retirement allowance otherwise payable to him into an optional spousal allowance of equivalent actuarial value in accordance with one (1) of the optional forms set out below. If an optional spousal allowance is selected and the spouse dies before the member, the member's pension shall, as of the first day of the next month after the death of the member's spouse, be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the pension was reduced at the date of retirement by virtue of the member's election of a spousal allowance. The member's spouse, if any, shall be required to sign the election form designated by the board, when the member applies for retirement. A spouse must be married to the member at retirement and one (1) year prior to death of the member or retired member to be eligible for a spousal allowance. The spousal allowance shall continue until the death of the spouse. Except as provided in section 22.3-60, a member's election of an optional spousal allowance shall be irrevocable. A spousal benefit shall be reduced by any workers' compensation benefit as provided for in section 22.3-53. The optional forms are as follows: 
Option 1: A reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with the provision that upon his death his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued and paid to his spouse as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledgeable and filed with the board at the time of his retirement (the joint and one hundred (100) percent spouse survivor option); or 
Option 2: A reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with the provision that upon his death three-quarters (3/4) of his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued and paid to his spouse as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board at the time of his retirement (the joint and seventy-five (75) percent spouse survivor option); or 
Option 3: A reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with the provision that upon his death one-half (1/2) of his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued and paid to his spouse as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board at the time of his retirement (the joint and fifty (50) percent spouse survivor option). 
    The actuarial factors used to convert normal form of payment (single life annuity payable monthly) to an optional form of payment are set forth in the administrative procedures manual maintained by the board.

Sec. 22.3-63. - Optional or modified retirement allowance. 
    Until the effective date of retirement, any member may elect to convert the retirement allowance otherwise payable to him into a modified retirement allowance of equivalent actuarial value in accordance with one (1) of the optional forms set out below. If a modified retirement allowance is selected and the beneficiary dies before the member, the member's pension allowance shall, as of the first day of the next month after the death of the member's beneficiary, be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which the pension was reduced at the date of retirement by virtue of the member's election of a modified retirement allowance. A modified retirement allowance shall continue until the death of the beneficiary. Except as provided in section 22.3-60, a member's election of a modified retirement allowance shall be irrevocable. The optional forms are as follows: 
Option 1: A reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with the provision that upon his death his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledgeable and filed with the board at the time of his retirement (the joint and one hundred (100) percent survivor option); or 
Option 2: A reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with the provision that upon his death one-half (1/2) of his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board at the time of his retirement (the joint and fifty (50) percent survivor option); or 
Option 3: A reduced retirement allowance payable during the life of the retired member, with the provision that, upon his death, some other benefit shall be payable; provided that the total value of the allowance during his life and the succeeding benefit shall be computed to be of equivalent actuarial value to the retirement allowance which he would receive without optional modification; provided further that the benefit shall be approved by the board (the joint and x percent survivor option). The actuarial factors used to convert to an option form of payment are set forth in the administrative procedures manual maintained by the board. 
    Should such member die within thirty (30) days after retirement, his optional election shall not be effective, he shall be considered a member in service at the time of his death, and the only benefit payable on his account shall be the nonoccupational death benefit provided in section 22.3-70 reduced by any retirement allowance payments received by him prior to his death. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the distribution options available to members shall be limited by the following restrictions: 
(a)  The present value of payments made to the member must be more than fifty (50) percent of the present value of the total payments to be made to the member and his beneficiary (based on the life expectancies as of the date benefits commence). 
(b)  Benefits will be distributed commencing not later than such taxable year: 
(1)  Over the life of such member or over the lives of such member and his spouse; or 
(2)  Over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such member or the life expectancy of such member and his spouse. 
(c)  If a member dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him, or distribution has been commenced in accordance with subsection (b)(2) above to his surviving spouse and such surviving spouse dies before his entire interest has been distributed to such surviving spouse, then his entire interest will be distributed within five (5) years after his death (or the death of his spouse). The preceding sentence shall not apply to term-certain distributions. 
    With respect to distributions beginning in calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and described in this section, in accordance with the regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code that were proposed on January 17, 2001.

ARTICLE X. - DEATH BENEFITS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 

Sec. 22.3-64. - Application for workers' compensation benefits required. 
    As a condition precedent to application for an occupational death benefit from the city plan, a member's beneficiary must first apply for workers' compensation death benefits and be awarded such benefits. Receipt of an award under the Workers' Compensation Act shall not relieve an applicant of the duty to prove his qualification for a benefit under the standards established by this chapter for the city plan. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-65. - Workers' compensation benefits offset against death benefits. 
(a)  Any amounts which may be paid or payable under the provisions of the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act or any similar law to any member or beneficiary, or to the dependents of any member or beneficiary, on account of death shall in such manner as the board shall determine, be offset against and payable in lieu of any benefits payable out of funds provided under the provisions of the city plan. 
(b)  In the case of a member, beneficiary or dependent of a member or beneficiary who elects to receive a lump sum settlement in lieu of periodic payments for temporary disability or death compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, the retirement allowance shall cease or be reduced, as the case may be. The amount of reduction shall be determined by the workers' compensation benefit which such person would have received had the lump sum settlement not been consummated, including all cost of living adjustments permitted by the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission, and had such person received periodic payments for disability or death for the maximum amount of time otherwise permitted under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act. The reduction shall continue each month for a period of months, until such time as the total amount of periodic payments for disability or death payable to such person under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act would have been offset had the lump sum settlement not been consummated. However, in the event a member dies after electing to receive a lump sum settlement in lieu of periodic payments for temporary disability compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, the death benefit payable to a beneficiary or dependent of a beneficiary shall be offset only to the extent the amount of the lump sum settlement in lieu of periodic payments for temporary disability compensable under the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act has not already been offset by any benefits payable out of funds provided under the provisions of the city plan. 
(c)  The above notwithstanding, no amount paid or payable under the provisions of the Virginia Workers' Compensation Act, or any similar law to any member or beneficiary, or to the dependents of any member or beneficiary, on account of permanent partial disability from any injury shall not be offset against any benefits payable out of funds under the provisions of the city plan.

The nonoccupational death benefit shall be an annuity benefit equal to fifty (50) percent of his accrued benefit on his date of death (but not reduced by any early payment reduction factor). The benefit shall commence on the day next following death. If the surviving spouse is more than sixty (60) months younger than the member the benefit shall be reduced by one-sixth ( 1/6 ) of one (1) percent for each full month in excess of sixty (60) months. 
(d)  The nonoccupational death benefit of a hybrid member shall be computed as a service retirement allowance on the same basis as described in subsection (c) above except that the accrued benefit on the date of death shall be determined using a multiplier two (2) percent instead of the one (1) percent applicable to a hybrid member. The nonoccupational death benefit of a hybrid member shall be offset by the actuarial equivalent of his account in the defined contribution plan as of the date of his death. 
(e)  Should the surviving spouse die while receiving the annuity benefit described in subsection (c) or (d), any excess accumulated contributions as of the date of the member's death, over the total annuity benefit previously received by the surviving spouse shall be paid to the surviving spouse's estate as soon as administratively practical following the spouse's death.

This benefit shall be reduced by workers' compensation benefits as provided in section 22.3-65. 
(c)  The occupational death benefit of a hybrid member shall be computed on the same basis as described in subsection (b) above. The occupational death benefit of a hybrid member shall be offset by the actuarial equivalent of his account in the defined contribution plan as of the date of his death. 
(d)  Should the member's surviving spouse and/or children receiving an allowance payable under the provisions set forth above die, any excess balance in the member's contribution account as of the date of the member's death, over the total survivor allowance paid to the surviving spouse and/or children shall be paid to the estate of the last surviving spouse or child as soon as administratively practical following the last survivor's death.

    Notwithstanding the foregoing, earnable compensation taken into account for purposes of determining benefits under the city plan shall be limited by the compensation limit pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. For purposes hereof, the compensation limit, for years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) (as adjusted in five thousand dollar ($5,000.00) increments from time to time by the adjustment factor described in Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, on the basis of a base period of the calendar quarter beginning July 1, 2001). In determining average final compensation for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2001, the limit on creditable compensation applied to compensation attributable to periods prior to July 1, 2001, shall be two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00). For purposes of applying the limitation applicable to each year, the limit for a plan year shall be the limitation in effect for the calendar year in which the plan year begins determined without increases in the limitation for subsequent years. 
(Ord. No. 39450, § 2, 7-16-12) 
Sec. 22.3-73. - Limitation on annual benefit and special vesting rules. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the annual benefit under the city plan of any member and any related death or other benefit, shall, if necessary, be reduced to the extent required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, all as applicable to governmental plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, adjustments in the dollar limitation under Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall only be applicable to benefits provided by this plan with respect to a member who is an eligible employee at the time the adjustment is effective. In comparing the plan benefit to the dollar limitation, plan benefits must be converted to an annual benefit (as defined in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) by, except as provided below, converting a benefit payable in a form other than a straight life annuity to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity before applying the limitations of this section. The annual benefit does not include any benefits attributable to after-tax employee contributions or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not maintained by a participating employer. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit is required for (a) the value of a joint and survivor annuity, (b) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as the qualified disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits), and (c) the value of post-retirement cost of living increases made in accordance with Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Inc. Tax Regs. Section 1.415-3(c)(2)(iii). Section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations thereunder are hereby incorporated by reference. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other plan provision to the contrary, for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Section 415(b)(2)(B), (C), or (D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the applicable actuarial adjustment factors shall be based on the following assumptions: 
(1)  Mortality according to the table prescribed in Rev. Rul. 2001-62, the 1994 Group Annuity Reserving Table (94 GAR). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the mortality table used for this purpose shall automatically be the table specified in any future revenue rulings or federal regulations that amend or supersede Revenue Ruling 2001-62 by specifying a new mortality table for this purpose. 
(2)  Interest at the rate prescribed in Section 415 Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations and other guidance published thereunder. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, a member shall be fully vested in his accrued benefit upon the attainment of normal retirement age.

(a)  To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, the following special rules shall apply in case of reemployed veterans notwithstanding any other provision of the plan: 
(1)  A reemployed veteran shall not be considered to have incurred a break in service by reason of his qualified military service. 
(2)  Qualified military service of a reemployed veteran shall be counted as service for vesting under the plan. For periods prior to July 1, 2014, qualified military service shall be counted for benefit accrual purposes and for a hybrid member, qualified military service after June 30, 2014, shall also be counted for benefit accrual purposes. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, in order for the qualified military service after June 30, 2014, to be counted as service for members other than hybrid members, a reemployed veteran shall be entitled to make the member contributions for the period of his qualified military service following his return to the employer's service as follows: 
(1)  Such contributions must be made during the period which begins on the date of reemployment with the participating employer following such qualified military service and ends on the earlier of (A) the reemployed veteran's severance from employment with the participating employer, or (B) at the end of the period equal to the lesser of (I) three (3) times the reemployed veteran's period of qualified military service, or (II) five (5) years. 
(2)  Earnable compensation to be used for purposes of determining the member contribution and benefit accrual with respect to a period of qualified military service shall mean the earnable compensation (as otherwise defined in the plan but based on rate of pay) which the reemployed veteran would have received but for his qualified military service. If a reemployed veteran's pay is not readily determinable, the reemployed veteran's earnable compensation shall then be his average earnable compensation for the twelve-month period (or actual shorter period of employment) immediately preceding his qualified military service. 
(3)  The board shall adopt procedures relating to the reemployed veteran's right to make member contributions for the period of his qualified military service following his return to the participating employer's service. 
(c)  To the extent required by USERRA or Section 401(a)(37) of the [Internal Revenue] Code for purposes of determining vesting in accrued benefits and entitlement to death benefits under the plan, in the event a member ceases to be an employee in order to perform qualified military service and dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing qualified military service, the member's death shall be considered to have occurred while he was an employee and, if he ceased to be an eligible employee in order to perform qualified military service, while he was an eligible employee so that his beneficiaries are entitled to any additional benefits provided under the plan (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service unless otherwise expressly provided), including, without limitation, any additional or enhanced vesting or death benefits, had the member resumed employment with the participating employer and then terminated employment on account of death. 
(d)  For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms have the following meanings: 
(1)  "Qualified military service" means any service in the uniformed services (as defined in Chapter 43 of Title 38, United States Code) by any individual if such individual is entitled to reemployment rights under such chapter with respect to such service and to the employer. 
(2)  "Reemployed veteran" means a person who is or, but for his qualified military service, would have been a member at some time during his qualified military service and who is entitled to the restoration benefits and protections of the USERRA with respect to his qualified military service and the plan.

Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 401-471, or any standards imposed by the Virginia department of environmental quality, water programs or its successor in authority, as amended, are hereby incorporated by reference where applicable and shall take precedence where such standards are more stringent than those set forth above. 
(b)  No significant industrial user or other user as determined by the control authority shall discharge industrial wastewaters into the sanitary sewer system without an appropriate industrial waste discharge permit as provided in this article and the rules and regulations of the WVWA. 
(c)  Unless exception is granted by the control authority or by other provisions of this chapter, the public sewer system shall be used by all persons discharging wastewater, industrial waste, polluted liquids or unpolluted waters or liquids. 
(d)  Unless authorized by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, water programs or its successor in authority, no person shall deposit or discharge any waste included in subsection (c) of this section on public or private property in or adjacent to any natural outlet, watercourse, storm sewer or other area within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(e)  The control authority shall determine, prior to discharge, that wastes to be discharged will receive such treatment as is required by the laws, regulations, ordinances, rules and orders of federal, state and local authorities, or such discharge shall not be permitted. 
(f)  Each industrial user discharging industrial wastewaters into the sanitary sewer system shall provide protection from slug or accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. At least every two (2) years, the control authority shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The control authority may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the control authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharged. 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals. 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority of any accidental or slug discharge. 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge.

Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the control authority for review, and shall be approved by the control authority before construction of the facility. No such user who commences operation after the effective date of this section shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been so approved. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. The notification shall include location of any accidental discharge or any discharge that may cause problems including a slug, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, or any discharge that may cause problems including a slug, the user shall submit to the control authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewer systems or treatment plant, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  In the event of an emergency, as determined by the control authority, the control authority and/or the city shall be authorized to immediately halt any actual or threatened discharge. 
(h)  A person discharging in violation of the provisions of this article, within thirty (30) days of the date of such discharge, shall sample, analyze and submit the data to the control authority.

(c)  Prior advance notification by the discharger to the control authority of any substantial change in volume or character of the discharge shall be required. Upon such notification, the control authority shall have the legal authority to deny or condition any new or increased discharge or any changes in the nature of the discharge if the discharge does not meet pretreatment standards, requirements or if the discharge would cause the plant to violate its Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permit. 
(d)  A person not applying for a discharge permit within the allotted time and continuing to discharge an unpermitted discharge shall be deemed to be in violation of this article. 
(e)  A permit issued under this section shall be valid for up to five (5) years from its date of issuance, after which time the industrial user shall be required to obtain a new discharge permit. 
(f)  An industrial user governed by this section may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (g) and (h). 
(g)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. An industrial user will immediately notify the POTW of any unanticipated bypass. A written report must be submitted within five (5) days. 
(h)  Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take an enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; or 
(3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(i)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (h) of this section. 
(j)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the following requirements are met: 
(1)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset.

2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(2)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(3)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. The requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(k)  All owners of facilities governed by industrial wastewater permits issued pursuant to this section shall also comply with any applicable reporting requirements, including but not limited to:

(d)  No permit shall be issued under this section except upon the signed application therefor by the owner of the property to be served by the crossover, or his duly authorized agent, and the application shall show on its face that the applicant agrees to be bound as provided in subsection (c) above.

Sec. 31.1-201. - Preliminary subdivision plat. 
    A subdivider may, at the subdivider's option, submit a preliminary subdivision plat and preliminary subdivision plan to the subdivision agent for approval.

(3)  Vacation of one (1) or more boundary lines which results in the creation of one (1) or two (2) lots. 
(b)  A minor subdivision plat shall not require a subdivision site plan unless improvements within a right-of-way are required by the City Code or are otherwise being provided by the subdivider, or the development is subject to the requirements of Chapter 11.4, Stormwater Management, of this Code. 
(c)  The following shall be classified as major subdivisions: 
(1)  Division of a single parcel into three (3) or more lots; or 
(2)  Vacation of one (1) or more boundary lines which results in three (3) or more lots.

(1)  The subdivision plat and plan (if required) meet the requirements of appendix B, and 
(2)  Payment of fees is received. 
(e)  The review period shall begin when the subdivision application is accepted for review. Once accepted, the subdivision agent shall begin review of the application for conformance with the requirements of this chapter, the zoning ordinance, and any other regulations. If the subdivision application is not accepted for review, the subdivision agent shall notify the subdivider within five (5) business days of the submittal date, stating the reasons for nonacceptance. 
(f)  The subdivision agent shall complete review and act on an initial application or a resubmitted application for a preliminary or final subdivision plat and plan review within twelve (12) business days of the date the application is accepted for review. If the subdivision agent disapproves an application, or a resubmitted application, the reasons for the disapproval shall be stated. 
(g)  Where an initial application or a resubmitted application is disapproved and the reasons for disapproval are stated, the subdivider shall indicate in a subsequent resubmitted application how the subdivision plat or plan were amended in response to each stated reason for disapproval. 
(h)  Approval of a subdivision site plan shall be indicated by the signature of the zoning administrator, the development review engineer, and the subdivision agent. Where the subdivision results in the dedication of right-of-way or any improvements to be performed within a right-of-way, the signature of the city engineer shall also be required. Any preliminary or final subdivision plat shall be approved only after the subdivision site plan (if required) is approved. 
(i)  The subdivision plat for any subdivision requiring performance guarantees pursuant to section 31.1-500 of this chapter shall be approved only after such guarantees are provided by the subdivider. 
(j)  Upon or before the expiration of the review period, the subdivision agent shall notify the subdivider that the subdivision plat is ready for approval, at which time the subdivider shall present to the subdivision agent three (3) original drawings of the subdivision plat on reproducible film.

The subdivision agent shall distribute copies to all appropriate city agencies which maintain records and official maps, including the city engineer and the office of real estate valuation. 
(Ord. No. 37985, § 1, 12-17-07) 
Sec. 31.1-205. - Failure to record subdivision plat. 
    Unless a plat is filed for recordation within six (6) months after final approval thereof, such approval shall be withdrawn and the plat marked void; however, in any case where construction of facilities to be dedicated for public use has commenced pursuant to an approved plan or permit with performance guarantees, or where the developer has furnished a performance guarantee to the city in the amount of the estimated cost of construction of such facilities, the time for plat recordation shall be extended to one (1) year after final approval or to the time limit specified in the performance guarantee, whichever is greater. 
Sec. 31.1-206. - Revision of an approved plat or plan. 
(a)  Revision of an approved subdivision plat which has not been recorded shall follow the procedures for approval of a subdivision plat in section 31.1-203. All copies of the previously-approved subdivision plat, as described in section 31.1-203(j), shall be marked void by the subdivision agent prior to the approval of a revised plat.

Sec. 31.1-207. - Vacation of a recorded plat. 
    A recorded plat, or part thereof, may be vacated before the sale of any lot according to the provisions of section 15.2-2271, Code of Virginia. A recorded plat, or any part thereof, where any of the lots have been sold, may be vacated according to the provisions of section 15.2-2272, Code of Virginia. 
Sec. 31.1-208. - Effect of recording approved plat. 
(a)  The recordation of an approved plat shall operate to transfer, in fee simple, to the city the portion of the premises platted as is on the plat set apart for streets, alleys or other public use and to transfer to the city any easement indicated on the plat to create a public right of passage over the land. The recordation of such plat shall operate to transfer to the city such easements shown on the plat for the conveyance of stormwater, and to the water authority such easements shown on the plat for conveyance of domestic water and sewage, including the installation and maintenance of any facilities utilized for such purposes, as the city and the water authority may require. Nothing contained in this article shall affect any right of a subdivider of land heretofore validly reserved. The clerk of circuit court shall index in the name of all the owners of property affected by the recordation in the grantor's index any plat recorded under this section. Nothing in this section shall obligate the city or the water authority to install or maintain such facilities unless otherwise agreed to by the city or the water authority. 
(b)  When the subdivision agent approves in accordance with this chapter a plat or replat of land, then upon the recording of the plat or replat in the office of the clerk of circuit court, all rights-of-way, easements or other interests of the city in the land included on the plat or replat, except as shown thereon, shall be terminated and extinguished, except that an interest acquired by the city by condemnation, by purchase for valuable consideration and evidenced by a separate instrument of record, or streets, alleys or easements for public passage subject to the provisions of section 15.2-2271 or 15.2-2272, Code of Virginia, shall not be affected thereby. All public easements, except those for public passage, easements containing improvements, those that contain private utility facilities, common or shared easements for the use of franchised cable operators and public service corporations, may be relocated by recordation of plat or replat signed by the owner of the real property, approved by the subdivision agent, regardless of the manner of acquisition or the type of instrument used to dedicate the original easement. In the event the purpose of the easement is to convey stormwater drainage from a public street, the city shall first determine that the relocation does not threaten either the integrity of the street or public passage. The clerk of circuit court shall index the city as grantor of any easement or portion thereof terminated and extinguished under this section. 
Sec. 31.1-209. - Period of validity. 
(a)  Once the subdivision agent has approved a preliminary subdivision plat, the approval shall be valid for a period of five (5) years, provided the subdivider (i) submits a final subdivision plat for all or a portion of the property within one (1) year of such approval, and (ii) thereafter diligently pursues approval of the final subdivision plat. "Diligent pursuit of approval" means that the subdivider has incurred extensive obligations or substantial expenses relating to the submitted final subdivision plat or modifications thereto. However, no sooner than three (3) years following such preliminary subdivision plat approval, and upon ninety (90) days' written notice by certified mail to the subdivider, the subdivision agent may revoke such approval upon a specific finding of facts that the subdivider has not diligently pursued approval of the final subdivision plat. 
(b)  An approved final subdivision plat which has been recorded or an approved final site plan, hereinafter referred to as "recorded plat or final site plan," shall be valid for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date of approval thereof. A subdivision site plan shall be deemed final once it has been reviewed and approved by the subdivision agent if the only requirement remaining to be satisfied in order to obtain a building permit is the posting of any bonds and escrows. 
(c)  For so long as the final site plan remains valid in accordance with the provisions of this section, or in the case of a recorded plat for five (5) years after approval, no change or amendment to any local ordinance, map, resolution, rule, regulation, policy or plan adopted subsequent to the date of approval of the recorded plat or final site plan shall adversely affect the right of the subdivider or developer or his successor in interest to commence and complete an approved development in accordance with the lawful terms of the recorded plat or site plan unless the change or amendment is required to comply with state law or there has been a mistake, fraud or a change in circumstances substantially affecting the public health, safety or welfare. 
Sec. 31.1-210. - Exceptions. 
(a)  Pursuant to section 15.2-2242(1), Code of Virginia, the subdivision agent may grant an exception from the general regulations of this chapter in cases of unusual situations or when strict adherence to the general regulations would result in substantial injustice or hardship. Such unusual situations may include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Steep topography; 
(2)  Irregular or narrow parcel shape; 
(3)  Existing natural features to be avoided or protected such as watercourses, floodplains, floodways, forested areas; or 
(4)  Irregular existing development patterns, including street patterns, that surround the parcel. 
(b)  A request for an exception shall be submitted in writing with the subdivision application or resubmitted application. The subdivision agent shall act on the request for an exception by either approving the application, approving the application with conditions, or disapproving the application. In granting an exception, the subdivision agent shall state in writing the findings made pursuant to subsection (a) above which justify the exception. 
Secs. 31.1-211-31.1-299. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - SUBDIVISION LAYOUT 

Sec. 31.1-300. - Layout of lots or parcels. 
(a)  Each building lot resulting from a subdivision shall conform to minimum and maximum dimensions required by the applicable zoning district regulations. 
(b)  In addition to applicable zoning regulations, the lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots resulting from a subdivision shall be appropriate for the location, type of development, and proposed land use. Depth and width of properties shall be adequate to provide for off-street parking, loading and service facilities required by the type of use and development anticipated. Corner lots shall contain additional width as necessary to accommodate a second half-width front yard. 
(c)  Each lot created shall have a direct usable vehicular access to the existing public street system either by way of a public street or an approved private street in a planned unit development district. However, subdivided unit lots for townhouses and rowhouses may be created pursuant to section 36.2-431(d) of the zoning ordinance, provided the lot from which the unit lots are subdivided has access required by this subsection. This subsection shall not preclude the establishment of shared driveways as long as the subdivider provides frontage as required by the zoning ordinance. 
(d)  Each lot created shall have public water and public sanitary sewer service extended to its property line. 
(e)  Side lot lines shall be arranged to create a buildable area where the minimum and maximum yard requirements of the applicable zoning district can be met. 
(f)  Any areas designated for purposes other than building, such as utilities, parks, public squares, or open space preservation, shall be clearly marked as such on the plat. Such areas shall not be considered lots and shall not be subject to dimensional requirements or street frontage requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
(g)  No lot shall be established which is divided by the corporate limits of the city. 
Sec. 31.1-301. - General layout of streets and alleys. 
(a)  The street system in a proposed subdivision shall be designed to extend and improve existing street rights-of-way adjoining the property to be subdivided. When a new subdivision adjoins undeveloped land which could be accessed via the land being subdivided, any new street within the subdivision determined necessary to serve the undeveloped land shall be extended to the subdivision boundaries and terminated with a temporary turnaround with a T-type or branch-type configuration. The right-of-way of the street shall not be widened to accommodate such turnaround. Any additional area needed for such turnaround shall be accommodated within an easement with provisions for the easement to be extinguished at the time the street is extended. 
(b)  New streets shall create an interconnected system with streets internal to the subdivision or to existing streets adjacent to or abutting the subdivision. The maximum street length between such connections shall be five hundred (500) feet. However, the subdivision agent may permit a terminated street, a longer street length, or both, where the subdivider demonstrates that topography, irregular or narrow parcel shape, natural features to be avoided or protected, or irregular street patterns surrounding the parcel, would require such a street layout to permit reasonable development of the parcel. Any street terminus shall be constructed as set forth in the VDOT Subdivision Street Design Requirements, 2005, as amended, and must employ one (1) of the following designs: 
(1)  Concentric or offset bulb with a landscaped center; 
(2)  T-type turnaround; or 
(3)  Branch-type turnaround. 
Any permanent street terminus shall be separated from an adjoining property which is not part of the property being subdivided by a minimum distance of fifty (50) feet. 
(c)  Naming of streets shall be proposed by the subdivider on the subdivision plat according to the following standards: 
(1)  Where a street is planned as a continuation of an existing street, such street will bear the same name. 
(2)  Names of new streets shall be sufficiently distinguishable from existing street names in the city or any adjoining jurisdiction. 
(d)  The subdivider shall bear the cost of erecting street name signs and traffic control signs and devices. The city's transportation division shall install signs and devices in accordance with city standards and bill the subdivider for actual costs incurred for materials and labor. Such fees shall be paid before the release of any performance guarantees required by this chapter. 
(e)  Alleys may be constructed to provide access to lots. An alley shall not be dedicated as a public right-of-way unless the subdivision agent determines the proposed alley is an extension of an existing public alley system. Alleys shall be clearly labeled on the subdivision plat as public or private. Where private alleys are created, a public easement for access shall be provided and dedicated on the subdivision plat. 
(f)  Private streets may be constructed for the purpose of providing lot frontage where city council has approved a development plan in a planned unit development district. All private streets shall have uninterrupted connection to a public street. The pavement design of private streets shall be the same as that for public streets. 
Sec. 31.1-302. - Off-site improvements. 
(a)  Pursuant to section 15.2-2243, Code of Virginia, where the construction or improvement of a subdivision necessitates or requires, at least in part, provision of reasonable and necessary sewerage, water, and drainage facilities located outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by the subdivider or developer, the subdivider may pay a pro-rata share of the cost of providing or improving such facilities, upon mutual agreement of the subdivider and the city or the water authority, as applicable. However, no such payment shall be required until such time as the city or the water authority has established a general sewer, water, and drainage improvement program for an area having related and common sewer, water, and drainage conditions and the land owned or controlled by the subdivider or developer is located or the city council has committed itself by ordinance to the establishment of such a program. Such ordinance shall set forth and establish reasonable standards to determine the proportionate share of total estimated cost of ultimate sewerage, water, and drainage facilities required to adequately serve a related and common area, when and if fully developed in accord with the adopted comprehensive plan, that shall be borne by each subdivider or developer within the area. Such share shall be limited to the amount necessary to protect water quality based upon the pollutant loading caused by the subdivision or development or to the proportion of such total estimated cost which the increased sewage flow, water flow, and/or increased volume and velocity of stormwater runoff to be actually caused by the subdivision or development bears to total estimated volume and velocity of such sewage, water, and/or runoff from such area in its fully developed state. In calculating the pollutant loading caused by the subdivision or development or the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff, city council shall take into account the effect of all on-site stormwater facilities or best management practices constructed or required to be constructed by the subdivider or developer and give appropriate credit therefor. The administration of such funds collected by the city shall be in accordance with sections 15.2-2243(B) and 15.2-2243(C), Code of Virginia. 
(b)  Pursuant to section 15.2-2242(4), Code of Virginia, if a subdivider or developer makes an advance of payments for or construction of reasonable and necessary street improvements located outside the property limits of the land owned or controlled by him, the need for which is substantially generated and reasonably required by the construction or improvement of the subdivision, and such advance is accepted, city council may agree to reimburse the subdivider or developer from such funds as the city council may make available for such purpose from time to time for the cost of such advance together with interest, which shall be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes, at a rate equal to the rate of interest on bonds most recently issued by the governing body on the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  City council shall determine or confirm that the road improvements were substantially generated and reasonably required by the construction or improvement of the subdivision and shall determine or confirm the cost thereof, on the basis of a study or studies conducted by qualified traffic engineers and approved and accepted by the subdivider; 
(2)  City council shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a report accepted and approved by the subdivider, indicating the governmental services required to be furnished to the subdivision or development and an estimate of the annual cost thereof for the period during which the reimbursement is to be made to the subdivider; and 
(3)  City council may make annual reimbursements to the subdivider from funds made available for such purpose from time to time, including but not limited to real estate taxes assessed and collected against the land and improvements on the property included in the subdivision or development in amounts equal to the amount by which such real estate taxes exceed the annual cost of providing reasonable and necessary governmental services to such subdivision. 
Sec. 31.1-303. - Additional requirements for subdivisions in the floodplain or in riparian buffer areas. 
(a)  Proposed buildings and structures shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with chapter 36.2, Zoning, of the city Code. 
(b)  All proposed grading, fill and related earthwork shall be in accordance with all applicable regulations set forth in section 36.2-333 and section 36.2-335 of the chapter 36.2, Zoning, of the City Code. 
(c)  The layout of a subdivision shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, including locating structures and streets such that evacuation during a flood event can occur. 
(d)  Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems shall be located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(e)  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(f)  Base flood elevation data for all major subdivisions and any subdivision involving more than five (5) acres shall be provided, and base flood information from the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) when water surface elevation data is available shall be provided. When such information is not available, base flood elevation data shall be obtained from other sources or developed using detailed methodologies, hydraulic and hydrologic analyses, comparable to those contained in a flood insurance study.

ARTICLE V. - PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES, SCHEDULE, AND INSPECTIONS 

Sec. 31.1-500. - Performance guarantees. 
    If a subdivision requires the installation of public improvements, such as streets, utilities, stormwater facilities, or erosion and sediment control measures, any of the documents set forth below may be required. Where any of the agreements and/or guarantees listed below are required, the preparer of the subdivision site plan shall submit a schedule of cost estimates in unit quantities, with totals, for all proposed public improvements, erosion and sediment control measures, and stormwater management measures, as part of the subdivision site plan submittal: 
(a)  Land subdivider's agreement between the subdivider and the city, guaranteeing the satisfactory installment of public improvements and erosion and sediment control measures at the expense of the subdivider within a reasonable length of time, not to exceed two (2) years. Pending the actual installation thereof, the subdivider shall execute and file with the city clerk, prior to approval of the final plan, a land subdivider's agreement to make such improvements within a designated reasonable length of time, not to exceed two (2) years, and a performance guarantee described in subsection (b), below. Such land subdivider's agreement shall include the following provisions: 
(1)  The subdivider will satisfactorily complete all grading within the time specified; 
(2)  The subdivider will plant, in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city engineer, all slopes in excess of two to one (2:1) and maintain such planting for a period of not less than one (1) year; 
(3)  The subdivider will undertake all erosion and sediment control measures in accordance with plans approved by the subdivision agent; 
(4)  The subdivider will install all required street and utility improvements in accordance with plans and specifications of the subdivision agent, the city engineer, and the water authority; and 
(5)  The subdivider will indemnify and hold harmless the city and any officials, agents, or employees thereof, and the water authority, and any officials, agents, or employees thereof, from any suit, claim or action for damages or any cost incurred by the city or the water authority as a consequence of failure on the part of the subdivider to comply with the terms of the agreement. 
(b)  A certified check or cash escrow in the amount of the estimated costs of construction or a personal, corporate or property bond, with surety satisfactory to the city attorney and director of finance, in an amount sufficient for and conditioned upon the construction of improvements required by the city and the water authority, or a contract for the construction of such facilities and the contractor's bond, with like surety, in like amount and so conditioned; or a bank or savings institution's letter of credit on certain designated funds satisfactory to the city as to the bank or savings institution, the amount and the form. The amount of such certified check, cash escrow, bond, or letter of credit shall not exceed the total of the estimated cost of construction based on unit prices for new public or private sector construction in the city and a reasonable allowance for estimated administrative costs, inflation, and potential damage to existing roads or utilities, which shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the estimated construction costs. 
(c)  Maintenance agreement between the subdivider and the city providing for future maintenance of privately-owned stormwater management facilities. Such agreement shall include the following provisions: 
(1)  That the responsibility and obligation of maintenance of the facilities is declared to be a perpetual covenant which shall run with the property and inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of the parties hereto. The subdivider covenants that it will not further subdivide the property without the deed or other instrument of conveyance reciting that a proportionate share of the responsibilities and obligations under the maintenance agreement shall run with each subdivided part of the original property. The responsibility of the subdivider as defined herein shall be in addition to any further requirements imposed by law. 
(2)  That maintenance is deemed to include, but is not limited to, maintaining grass and weeds within any facility cut in accordance with city regulations, keeping emergency spillways clean and functional with an unobstructed outlet from these spillways leading to a natural watercourse, and removing debris, sediment and other matter from any facilities in order to reduce sedimentation.

Periodic partial releases may not occur before the completion of at least thirty (30) percent of the public facilities covered by any bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee. The subdivision agent shall not be required to execute more than three (3) periodic partial releases in any twelve-month period. Upon final completion and acceptance of the public facilities, the subdivision agent shall release any remaining bond, escrow, letter of credit, or other performance guarantee to the subdivider or developer. For the purpose of final release, the term "acceptance" means whenever the public facility is accepted by and taken over for operation and maintenance by the city or the water authority. 
(b)  Prior to any full release of guarantees, the following shall be required: 
(1)  Permanent monuments consisting of iron pins shall be placed at all block corners or at the tangent points of curves connecting intersecting street lines, at the points of curvature and tangency, at all corners in the exterior boundary of the subdivision except at such corners that are inaccessible due to topography, and at such other points as may be required by the subdivision agent. The location and character of all such monuments shall be designated on the subdivision plat. The applicant shall certify in writing that the monuments have been accurately placed throughout the subdivision as required before the streets may be accepted for maintenance or the performance guaranty is released. 
(2)  If requested by the subdivision agent or water authority, the subdivider shall provide the subdivision agent with a set of as-built plans if any underground improvement is installed in a location or manner other than was shown on the approved subdivision site plan.

(1)  The real estate shall fall within the following special classification herein established and defined for the purpose of assessment and taxation under this division: "Real estate devoted to agricultural use" shall mean real estate devoted to the bona fide production for sale of plants and animals useful to man under uniform standards prescribed by the state commissioner of agriculture and commerce or devoted to and meeting the requirements and qualifications for payments or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the federal government. [5] 
(2)  The real estate shall further consist of a minimum of five (5) acres actually devoted to agricultural use. [6] 
(b)  Such application shall be on forms provided by the state department of taxation and supplied by the assessor and shall include such additional schedules, photographs and drawings as may be required by the assessor. All record owners of the real estate described in the application shall execute such application; provided, however, an individual who is the owner of an undivided interest in a parcel may apply on behalf of himself and the other owners of such parcel upon submitting an affidavit that such other owners are minors or cannot be located. 
(c)  An application shall also be submitted whenever the use or acreage of such land previously approved changes, except when a change in acreage occurs solely as a result of a conveyance necessitated by governmental action or condemnation of a portion of any land previously approved for taxation on the basis of use assessment; provided, however, that such property owner or owners must revalidate annually with the assessor any applications previously approved. 
(d)  An application fee of ten dollars ($10.00) per parcel plus ten cents ($0.10) per acre or portion thereof contained in such parcel shall accompany each application for taxation on the basis of use assessment and each application required to be filed whenever the use or acreage of such land previously approved changes, such fee being payable to the city. 
(e)  A separate application shall be filed and separate fees shall be paid for each parcel appearing on the land book as a separate parcel. 
(f)  The assessor may permit late filing of any of the applications required to be filed by this section, including annual revalidations, within no more than sixty (60) days after November one (1) of any year, upon the payment of a late filing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per application. 
(g)  No application for assessment based on use shall be accepted or approved if, at the time the application is filed, the tax on the land affected is delinquent. Upon the payment of all delinquent taxes, including penalties and interest, the application shall be treated in accordance with the provisions hereof. If on June 1st of any year the taxes for any prior year on any parcel of real property which has a special assessment as provided for in this chapter are delinquent, the city treasurer shall forthwith send notice of that fact and the general provisions of this subsection to the property owner by first class mail. If, after sending such notice, such delinquent taxes remain unpaid on November 1st, the treasurer shall notify the assessor and shall also notify the commissioner of revenue who shall remove such parcel from the land use program. 
(h)  If at any time after July 1, 1980, the zoning of property taxes under the provisions of this chapter is changed to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent, such property shall not be eligible for assessment and taxation under this chapter for the years such change is effective or any subsequent tax year, but it shall not be subject to roll-back taxes until a change in use occurs. When a change in use occurs, such owner shall be subject to roll-back taxes as provided in this chapter for those years the property was taxed in accordance with its use.

Sec. 32-65. - Determination of assessor-Generally. 
    Upon receipt of an application under this division, the assessor shall determine whether the subject property meets the criteria for taxation under this division.

Sec. 32-66. - Same-Procedure to be followed. 
    The procedure to be followed by the assessor in making the determination referred to in section 32-65 shall be as follows: 
(1)  In valuing real estate for purposes of taxation pursuant to this division, the assessor shall consider only those indicia of value which such real estate has for agricultural use, and real estate taxes shall be extended upon the value so determined. In addition to use of his personal knowledge, judgment and experience as to the value of real estate in agricultural and in other uses, the assessor shall, in arriving at the value of such land, consider available evidence of agricultural capability and the recommendations of value of such real estate as made by the state land evaluation advisory committee. 
(2)  In determining the total area of real estate actively devoted to agricultural use, there shall be included the area of all real estate under barns, sheds, silos, cribs, greenhouses, lakes, dams, ponds, streams, irrigation ditches and like facilities; but real estate under, and such additional real estate as may be actually used in connection with, the farmhouse or home or any other structure not related to such special use shall be excluded in determining such total area. 
(3)  All structures which are located on real estate in agricultural use and the farmhouse or home or any other structure not related to such special use and the real estate on which the farmhouse or home or such other structure is located, together with the additional real estate used in connection therewith, shall be valued, assessed and taxed by the same standards, methods and procedures as other taxable structures and other real estate in the city. 
(4)  Real estate in agricultural use shall be evaluated as for assessment on the basis of fair market value as applied to other real estate in the city, and land book records shall be maintained to show both the use value and the fair market value of such real estate. 
(5)  In determining whether the subject property meets the criteria for agricultural use, the assessor may request the state commissioner of agriculture and commerce to issue an opinion. 
(6)  Where contiguous real estate in agricultural use in one (1) ownership is located partly within and partly without the city, compliance with the minimum acreage or gross sales requirement shall be determined on the basis of the total acreage of such real estate and not the acreage located within the city.

(Ord. No. 22798, § 3, 3-29-76) 
Sec. 32-68. - Roll-back tax when use changes to nonqualifying use-Generally. 
(a)  When real estate qualifies for assessment and taxation under the provisions of this division and the use by which it is qualified changes to a nonqualifying use, there shall be imposed on such real estate a roll-back tax in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the taxes paid or payable on the basis of the valuation, assessment and taxation under this division were exceeded by the taxes that would have been paid or payable on the basis of the valuation, assessment or taxation of other real estate in the city in the year of the change and in each of the five (5) years immediately preceding the year of the change, plus simple interest on such roll-back taxes at the same yearly interest rate applicable to delinquent real estate taxes in this city. If in the tax year in which the change of use occurs, the real estate was not valued, assessed and taxed under this division, the real estate shall be subject to roll-back taxes for such of the five (5) years immediately preceding in which the real estate was valued, assessed and taxed under this division. 
(b)  In determining the roll-back taxes chargeable on real estate which has changed in use, the treasurer shall extend the real estate tax rates for the current and next preceding five (5) years, or such lesser number of years as the property may have been taxed on its use value, upon the difference between the value determined under subparagraph (4) of section 32-66, and the use value determined under subparagraph (1) of such section for each such year. 
(c)  Liability to the roll-back taxes shall attach when a change in use occurs, but not when a change in ownership of the title takes place, if the new owner continues the real estate in the use for which it is classified under the conditions prescribed in this division. 
(d)  The owner of any real estate liable for roll-back taxes under this section shall, within sixty (60) days following a change in use, report such change to the assessor and to the commissioner on such forms as may be prescribed. The commissioner shall forthwith determine and assess the roll-back tax, which shall be paid to the treasurer within thirty (30) days of the assessment. On failure to report within sixty (60) days following such change in use or upon the failure to pay within thirty (30) days of the assessment, such owner shall be liable for an additional penalty equal to ten (10) percent of the amount of the roll-back tax and interest thereon, which penalty shall be collected as a part of the tax. In addition to such penalty, there is hereby imposed interest on the roll-back tax, interest and penalty at the same yearly interest rate applicable to delinquent real estate taxes in this city for each year or fraction thereof during which the failure continues after the date of such change in use.

Any petitioner who is unsatisfied with the written decision of the director may within thirty (30) days of the date of said decision, appeal such decision to the appropriate court in the jurisdiction where the seizure occurred.

Sec. 36.2-313. - Front yard dimensions for infill development. 
    To determine the established front yard in the table below, the Zoning Administrator shall consider only the following lot or lots: (1) a lot or lots on which there is a principal structure on the same block face, and (2) up to one (1) lot on each side of a subject property which is closest to the subject property. However, no lot being used to determine the established front yard shall be an outlier. An outlier shall be any yard depth that deviates by more than twenty (20) percent from the average yard depth on the block face, not including the outlier or outliers. In such instances, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the most shallow established front yard to be equal to such average depth. 
Where the most shallow established front yard is between the minimum and maximum front yards of the district Minimum yard: depth of the most shallow established front yard 
Maximum yard: depth of the most shallow established front yard, plus 5 feet Where the most shallow established front yard is deeper than the district's maximum front yard Minimum yard: depth of most shallow established front yard. 
Maximum yard: average between the depth of most shallow established front yard and deepest established front yard, excluding outliers as defined above. Where the most shallow established front yard is more shallow than the district's minimum front yard, but is 10 feet or greater Minimum yard: depth of the most shallow established front yard 
Maximum yard: depth of the most shallow established front yard, plus 10 feet Where the most shallow established front yard is less than 10 feet Minimum yard: depth of the most shallow established front yard 
Maximum yard: 20 feet Where the lot has frontage on a cul-de-sac, regardless of the presence of buildings on adjoining lots Minimum: same as district minimum 
Maximum: same as district maximum When there are no lots with principal residential structures on the block face Minimum: same as district minimum 
Maximum: same as district maximum For a corner lot, apply the above scenarios to the front yard with the primary facade Minimum: same as district minimum 
Maximum: same as district maximum

DIVISION 2. - MULTIPLE PURPOSE DISTRICTS 

Sec. 36.2-314. - Purposes of multiple purpose districts. 
(a)  The purpose of the MX District is to accommodate residential uses, office uses, and support services within the same district. The intent of the district is that no retail sales uses be permitted and that the district facilitates a harmonious mixture of office and residential uses. The regulations of the district are intended to protect the character and scale of such a mixed-use development pattern by permitting low-intensity development at a scale that recognizes and respects residential patterns of development. 
(b)  The purpose of the CN District is to encourage a concentration of neighborhood-scaled retail, office, and service uses, in clearly defined, compact areas in close proximity to residential neighborhoods. The regulations of the district are intended to control the scale of nonresidential buildings in a manner that makes them compatible with and appropriate for surrounding residential areas and to encourage a development pattern that consists of ground floor commercial uses with offices and residential uses on the upper floor levels. The district is intended to promote pedestrian-oriented development, with buildings located close to the street, pedestrian-scaled signage, main entrances oriented to the street frontage sidewalk, windows or display cases along building façades which face the street, and significant building coverage of the site. Although parking areas may be provided, they are generally limited in size and are deemphasized by their location on the site. 
(c)  The purpose of the CG District is to permit motor vehicle dependent uses that are generally developed as single use developments on individual lots, subject to landscaping, access, and signage standards. Such development is generally characterized by individual curb cuts, access drives, and signage. It is intended that this district be applied primarily along heavily traveled arterial streets, with an emphasis on clustering such development at major intersections. While recognizing the motor vehicle traffic generated by the uses permitted in this district, it is the intent of the regulations of the district to encourage and recognize pedestrian access and public transit forms of transportation by locating parking to the side and rear of buildings and minimizing conflict through landscaping and signage standards. The uses permitted in this district generally require a high volume of traffic along the frontage of the establishment and include horizontally oriented buildings. Such permitted uses include general retail establishments, offices, service establishments, motor vehicle related sales and service, eating establishments, and entertainment uses. The CG District is also intended to accommodate travel-oriented uses such as hotels, motels, and gasoline stations. 
(d)  The purpose of the CLS District is to accommodate multiple buildings and uses that are large in scale and generally characterized by multiple tenants or uses on a single zoning lot which share common parking, curb cuts, driveways, and access to and from streets. These uses and areas are heavily dependent on the motor vehicle and tend to result in large parking areas and outdoor display of merchandise. CLS District uses include large motor vehicle sales and service establishments and community and regional shopping centers. The district standards provide for landscaped buffers to minimize the impact of CLS uses on surrounding areas. 
(e)  The purpose of the D District is to permit a wide variety of uses and relatively intense development in the downtown, consistent with historic development patterns, in a manner that protects and enhances the business and cultural center of the City and region. Toward that end, the Downtown District is intended to accomplish the following: 
(1)  Facilitate pedestrian ways and create a convenient and harmonious development of buildings, streets, and open space; 
(2)  Protect and enhance the public interest in downtown as a source of economic vitality, the retention and creation of jobs, and tax revenue; 
(3)  Protect existing investment in downtown, to protect against the demolition of downtown's historic buildings, to promote activity on public streets, and to protect amenities provided through public investment; and 
(4)  Provide for a mix of high density residential, commercial, retail, government services, entertainment and cultural facilities, and live/work space. 
(f)  The purpose of the IN District is to provide standards for the accommodation of institutional developments on zoning lots of five (5) acres or less in order to achieve the following specific purposes: 
(1)  Recognize the unique needs of institutional uses and their relationship with neighboring land uses; 
(2)  Reduce traffic congestion, provide adequate parking, and promote pedestrian linkages; 
(3)  Facilitate the creation of a convenient and harmonious development of buildings, parking, and open spaces for individual institutional uses; 
(4)  Ensure the proper functioning of such institutional uses; and 
(5)  Minimize the potential for adverse impacts of institutional uses on adjacent land uses. 
(g)  The purpose of the ROS District is to recognize and enhance active park and recreation lands, passive open spaces, and significant natural and scenic features by encouraging these areas to protect unique land resources from degradation, consistent with the recommendations of the City's Comprehensive Plan. It is further intended to prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses, while permitting limited construction within open space areas which is supportive of their function and which promotes their use and enjoyment. 
(h)  The purpose of the UF District is to promote high intensity, mixed use development that is economically viable, pedestrian oriented, attractive and harmonious, and contributes to the place-making character of the City. The district is designed to provide new development and redevelopment opportunities in the form of mixed use structures that offer a wide range of complementary land uses. This special purpose district is intended to be applied to underperforming urban industrial areas that have sufficient infrastructure to support mixed use development. The district provides for a mix of small scale industrial, commercial, institutional, and residential uses.

(e)  At least thirty (30) percent of the civic space shall consist of landscaped area. Such area shall include one (1) large deciduous tree for each five hundred (500) square feet of landscaped area or portion thereof up to two thousand (2,000) square feet. One (1) additional large deciduous tree shall be required for each additional one thousand (1,000) square feet of civic space. One (1) deciduous or evergreen shrub shall be provided for each ten (10) square feet of landscaped area with vegetative ground cover or one (1) square foot of planted bed for each ten (10) square feet of landscaped area with vegetative ground cover on remaining space. 
(f)  Two (2) of the following amenities shall be provided within the civic space: ornamental fountains, waterfalls, sculpture, art, performance spaces, monuments, or trellises. 
(g)  The civic yard space must provide access from the abutting right-of-way to a primary entrance. 
(Ord. No. 39122, § 1, 5-16-11; Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12; Ord. No. 40088, § 1, 10-20-14) 
Sec. 36.2-318. - Pedestrian access. 
    In districts where indicated as applicable in Section 36.2-316, designated pedestrian pathways of a minimum unobstructed width of five (5) feet shall be provided and clearly defined from the public sidewalk, or the public right-of-way where there is no public sidewalk, to the public entrance of any principal building. Such pedestrian pathways shall be handicapped accessible, surfaced with concrete, asphalt, bituminous pavement, brick or stone pavers, or a permeable pavement system, and shall be distinguished and separated from driveways and parking spaces by landscaping, berms, barriers, grade separation or other means to protect pedestrians from vehicular traffic.

(b)  For corner and through lots, the primary street frontage shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator based on the classification of the street (local, collector, or arterial) from the Roanoke's Street Hierarchy Map in the City of Roanoke Street Design Guidelines. The street with the most intensive classification shall be determined to be the primary street. Arterial streets are considered the most intensive classification and local streets the least intensive. The Zoning Administrator may determine an alternative primary street frontage based on: 
(1)  Actual traffic counts provided by the Virginia Department of Transportation, the City of Roanoke, or the developer of a project through a documented traffic study. 
(2)  Orientation of other buildings along the adjacent street frontages. 
(3)  Specific direction from a City Council adopted neighborhood plan, area plan, or corridor plan. 
(c)  For purposes of calculating the minimum façade transparency, the overall area of a façade shall be calculated as identified below for ground and upper floors. The minimum required transparency shall then be calculated by applying the minimum façade transparency percentages from Section 36.2-316 to the calculated overall façade. 
(1)  Ground floor. The linear width of the ground floor façade multiplied by an assumed height of ten (10) feet. 
(2)  Upper floors. The linear width of the upper floor multiplied by an assumed height of eight (8) feet. 
(d)  A primary entrance shall be located within the required minimum and maximum front yards, with the threshold located at the grade of the adjacent sidewalk or at the adjacent grade when not abutting a sidewalk. Such primary entrance shall be accessible during normal business hours to employees and customers/patrons of the building occupant. 
Exceptions: 
(1)  Where building placement is established according to the civic space yard option, a primary entrance shall abut the civic space yard with the entrance threshold located at the grade of the abutting civic space yard. 
(2)  The primary entrance in the MX or IN District may be above the finished grade of the adjacent sidewalk or adjacent grade of the site. 
(e)  Arrangement of transparency on a façade facing a primary street frontage. 
(1)  At least sixty (60) percent of the specified ground floor transparency shall be located within a horizontal zone of the façade located between two (2) feet and eight (8) feet above the finished floor elevation where the primary entrance is located. Such transparency shall begin at a height no greater than three (3) feet above the finished floor elevation of the primary entrance. 
(2)  Transparency shall be arranged so that no more than twenty (20) linear feet of ground floor building façade is void of transparency. 
(3)  No more than thirty (30) percent of the required transparent area between two (2) feet and eight (8) feet in height above the finished floor elevation of the primary entrance may be covered by opaque or semiopaque materials, such as window or door signs or tinting. 
(4)  No wall or other permanent visual obstruction shall be located within twenty-four (24) inches of the interior of the specified transparent area. Merchandise displays facing the street or operable blinds, shades, or curtains shall not be considered permanent visual obstructions.

DIVISION 5. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 36.2-330. - Historic Downtown Overlay District (H-1). 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the Historic Downtown Overlay District (H-1) is to identify, preserve, enhance, and maintain architectural and historic landmarks, structures, and districts that are listed, or are eligible for listing, on the Virginia Landmarks Register or the National Register of Historic Places, or which have local significance. An additional purpose of the H-1 Overlay District is to develop and maintain appropriate settings and environments for such landmarks, structures, and districts. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  The City Council may, in the manner provided for amending this chapter, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.2-540, designate as a Historic Downtown Overlay District (H-1) appropriate areas which: 
(A)  Contain landmarks or structures that are listed, or are eligible for listing, on the Virginia Landmarks Register or the National Register of Historic Places, or which have local significance; 
(B)  Are adjacent to landmarks designated as historic by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources; 
(C)  Are adjacent to any other structures within the City having important historic, architectural, or cultural interest; or 
(D)  Contain buildings or sites having special public value because of notable architecture, historic events, or other worthy features relating to the social, cultural, or artistic heritage of the community, which are of such significance as to warrant conservation and preservation. 
(2)  Any Historic Downtown Overlay District (H-1) designated by the City Council as provided for in subsection (1), above, shall be shown as an overlay to the existing underlying district on the Official Zoning Map. As such, the provisions in this section shall serve as a supplement to the underlying base zoning district regulations. Where a conflict exists between the regulations relating to the H-1 Overlay District and those of any underlying base zoning district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(c)  Certificate of Appropriateness. A Certificate of Appropriateness (see Section 36.2-530) shall be required for the demolition, moving, erection, reconstruction, alteration, or restoration of any structure or historic landmark in the H-1 Overlay District. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be required for ordinary maintenance as defined in Section 36.2-530(b)(4). The Zoning Administrator, in consultation with the Agent to the Architectural Review Board, shall determine whether an activity requires a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(d)  Review standards for new construction or exterior modifications. The following standards shall be applied by the Architectural Review Board in considering a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction or exterior modifications to an existing structure in the H-1 Overlay District. 
(1)  Generally: 
(A)  The relationship of the changes to the historic, architectural, or cultural significance of the structure and the surrounding district; and 
(B)  The appropriateness of the change in terms of architectural compatibility with the distinguishing historic and architectural features of the structure and the district. Architectural compatibility shall be judged in terms of a proposed structure's mass, dimensions, materials, color, ornamentation, architectural style, lighting, and other criteria deemed pertinent. 
(2)  Renovations: For renovations, the ten (10) following basic standards, set forth by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, shall apply: 
(A)  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(B)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(C)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(D)  Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(E)  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. 
(F)  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(G)  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(H)  Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(I)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(J)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(3)  New construction: For new construction, the following standards shall apply: 
(A)  The design for new construction shall be sensitive to and take into account the special characteristics that the district is established to protect. Such consideration may include building scale, height, and orientation, site coverage, spatial separation from other buildings, façade and window patterns, entrance and porch size and general design, materials, textures, color, architectural details, roof forms, emphasis of horizontal or vertical elements, walls, fences, and any other features deemed appropriate; and 
(B)  The design of the new construction shall recognize the relationships among buildings in the immediate setting rather than specific styles or details since architectural styles and details may vary from one (1) section of the district to another. 
(4)  Signage: For signage, the following standards shall apply: 
(A)  Signs shall be compatible with and relate to the design elements of the building with which they are associated or to which they are attached, rather than obscure or disrupt such design features; 
(B)  Signs shall be compatible with other signs and buildings in the district and adjacent to the property; and 
(C)  Compatibility shall be judged in terms of dimensions, materials, color, letter style and placement, lighting, and overall general effect on the building and district. 
(5)  Accessory structures: For accessory structures, the following standards shall apply: 
(A)  Existing characteristic features such as walls, fencing, walkways, and other similar structures or site features that reflect the building's or district's history and development shall be retained; and 
(B)  Accessory structures shall be appropriate to and compatible with the architectural features of the principal structure and the district. 
(6)  In addition to the standards set forth in subsections (1) through (5), above, the Architectural Review Board may adopt specific Architectural Design Guidelines for the H-1 Overlay District, or a portion of the H-1 Overlay District. The Architectural Review Board shall consider the applicable guidelines in its decisions to issue or deny Certificates of Appropriateness. 
(e)  Review standards for demolition. The following standards shall be applied by the Architectural Review Board in considering a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition of a structure or historic landmark within the H-1 Overlay District: 
(1)  The purpose and necessity of the demolition are in accordance with the intent of the Historic Downtown Overlay District (H-1); 
(2)  Loss of the structure would not be adverse to the district or the public interest by virtue of its uniqueness or its contribution to the district; and 
(3)  Demolition would not have an adverse effect on the character and surrounding environment of the district. 
Sec. 36.2-331. - Historic Neighborhood Overlay District (H-2). 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the Historic Neighborhood Overlay District (H-2) is to identify, preserve, enhance, and maintain those architectural and historic landmarks, structures, and districts which are listed, or are eligible for listing, on the Virginia Landmarks Register or the National Register of Historic Places, or which have local significance. Moreover, the H-2 Overlay District is intended to encourage new construction that is compatible with the district and to develop and maintain appropriate settings and environments for such landmarks, structures, and districts. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  The City Council may, in the manner provided for amending this chapter, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.2-540, designate as a Historic Neighborhood Overlay District (H-2) appropriate areas which: 
(A)  Contain landmarks or structures that are listed, or are eligible for listing, on the Virginia Landmarks Register or the National Register of Historic Places, or which individually or collectively represent a distinguishable entity of local historic, cultural, or architectural importance; 
(B)  Are adjacent to landmarks designated as historic by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources or are adjacent to other structures, landmarks, or areas having important historic, architectural, or cultural interest; or 
(C)  Contain buildings or places in which historic events occurred or which have special public value because of notable architectural or other features relating to the cultural or artistic heritage of the community, or are of such significance as to warrant conservation and preservation. 
(2)  Any Historic Neighborhood Overlay District (H-2) designated by the City Council as provided for in subsection (1), above, shall be shown as an overlay to the existing underlying district on the Official Zoning Map. As such, the provisions in this section shall serve as a supplement to the underlying base zoning district regulations. Where a conflict exists between the regulations relating to the H-2 Overlay District and those of any underlying base zoning district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(c)  Certificate of Appropriateness. In the H-2 Overlay District, a Certificate of Appropriateness (see Section 36.2-530) shall be required for the erection of any new structure, the demolition, moving, reconstruction, alteration, or restoration of any existing structure or historic landmark, including the installation or replacement of siding, or the reduction in the floor area of an existing building, including the enclosure or removal of a porch. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be required for ordinary maintenance, as defined in Section 36.2-530(b)(4), or in-kind replacement with the same materials, proportions, and design. The Zoning Administrator, in consultation with the Agent to the Architectural Review Board, shall determine whether an activity requires a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(d)  Review standards for new construction or exterior modifications. 
(1)  The following standards shall be applied by the Architectural Review Board in considering a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for new construction or exterior modifications to an existing structure in the H-2 Overlay District: 
(A)  The design shall be compatible with the character of the H-2 Overlay District with respect to building location and scale, roof forms, windows and doors, siding, trim, and porches; and 
(B)  The design of existing architectural features, with respect to proportion and texture, shall be retained. 
(2)  In addition to the standards of subsection (1), above, the Architectural Review Board may adopt specific Architectural Design Guidelines for the H-2 Overlay District, or a portion of the H-2 Overlay District. The Architectural Review Board shall consider the applicable guidelines in its decisions to issue or deny a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(e)  Review standards for demolition. The following standards shall be applied by the Architectural Review Board in considering a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition of a structure or historic landmark within the H-2 Overlay District: 
(1)  The purpose and necessity of the demolition are in accordance with the intent of the Historic Neighborhood Overlay District (H-2); 
(2)  Loss of the structure would not be adverse to the district or the public interest by virtue of its uniqueness or its contribution to the district; and 
(3)  Demolition would not have an adverse effect on the character and surrounding environment of the district. 
Sec. 36.2-332. - Neighborhood Design Overlay District (ND). 
(a)  Purpose. The Neighborhood Design Overlay District (ND) is intended to promote quality City design by coordinating the development of designated Rehabilitation and Conservation Areas. The City finds and determines that the standards of the ND Overlay District promote compatibility between buildings and structures in the City's traditional neighborhoods, maintain property values, and promote pedestrian-friendly, walkable streets. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  The City Council may, in the manner provided for amending this chapter, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.2-540, apply the Neighborhood Design Overlay District (ND) to areas of the City that are designated Rehabilitation and Conservation Areas. The regulations of this section shall apply to the construction of, an addition to, or the exterior modification of a dwelling in a designated ND Overlay District. 
(2)  Any Neighborhood Design Overlay District (ND) designated by the City Council as provided for in subsection (1), above, shall be shown as an overlay to the existing underlying district on the Official Zoning Map. As such, the provisions in this section shall serve as a supplement to the underlying base zoning district regulations. Where a conflict exists between this section relating to the ND Overlay District and those of any underlying base zoning district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(c)  Design standards. In considering an application for a zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator shall apply the following standards for construction of, an addition to, or the exterior modification of a dwelling in the ND: 
(1)  Building location and massing: 
(A)  The required front yard shall be determined by the regulations of the applicable base zoning district. 
(B)  A new dwelling shall have two (2) stories above the grade of the front yard where lots on both sides have two-story dwellings. 
(C)  The width of single-family and two-family dwellings shall be within twenty (20) percent of the average of the widths of other single-family and two-family dwellings on the same side of the same block. The front of multifamily dwellings shall be broken into sections of thirty (30) feet or less in width through offsets of the vertical plane of the façade of at least twelve (12) inches. 
(D)  Where lots on both sides have dwellings, the height of the foundation facing the street shall be no more than twenty (20) percent greater than the height of the tallest adjoining foundation and shall be no less than twenty (20) percent below the height of the shortest adjoining foundation. Where a dwelling exists only on one (1) side, the foundation height shall be within twenty (20) percent of the height of that adjoining dwelling. However, when the first floor of a dwelling meets the standards for accessibility in accordance with the Internation Code Commission [International Code Council] document A117.1-2009 - Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, the height of the foundation shall be within forty (40) percent of adjoining foundation heights rather than twenty (20) percent. Such measurements shall be taken at comparable locations on the respective foundations (i.e., left side, right side). There is no foundation height requirement where no dwellings exist on either adjoining lot. 
(2)  Roofs: 
(A)  The rise-to-run ratio for the dwelling's main roof shall be 6:12 or steeper. 
(B)  The roof of a new dwelling shall have a minimum of three (3) surfaces, except where the gable end faces the street and a porch extends the full width of the dwelling, in which case the roof may have a two-surface configuration. 
(C)  Eave and gable overhangs for all new dwellings and additions to dwellings shall be at least twelve (12) inches. However, an addition to an existing dwelling shall not be required to have overhangs wider than those of the existing dwelling. 
(D)  The rise-to-run ratio of roofs covering porches or entrances shall be equal to or shallower than the main roof. 
(E)  Above-grade entrances on a building façade facing a required front yard shall be covered with a roof with a minimum width and depth of thirty-six (36) inches. 
(3)  Entrances and windows: 
(A)  The dwelling shall have at least one (1) entrance facing the primary front yard. The number of doors facing the primary front yard shall be limited to one (1) door for every eighteen (18) feet of dwelling width. Single-family and two-family dwellings may have two entrances facing the primary front yard regardless of dwelling width if the second entrance is recessed at least six (6) feet behind the main front entrance. 
(B)  Doors facing a street shall have panel insets or windows. 
(C)  At least fifteen (15) percent of the front of the dwelling shall consist of window or door openings. At least ten (10) percent of the side of a dwelling which is not the front of the dwelling and which faces a street shall consist of window or door openings. Roofs, gables, and foundations shall not be included in determining the area of the front or the side of the dwelling. 
(D)  Windows on the front façade shall have a height that is at least one and one-half (11/2) times their width. 
(E)  Windows on the front of the dwelling shall be arranged in a manner that is compatible with that of other dwellings in the district. In general, windows on separate stories of the front should be vertically aligned and windows on the same story should be horizontally aligned. 
(F)  All stairs facing a required front yard shall have solid risers. 
(G)  A sidewalk at least three (3) feet in width shall be provided between the front porch of a new dwelling and the street. The sidewalk shall be constructed of an impervious material customarily used for sidewalks in the district. 
(4)  Siding and trim: 
(A)  The siding of any dwelling, exclusive of trim materials, shall not be oriented vertically. 
(B)  Windows and doors shall be surrounded by trim which is at least three and one-half (31/2) inches wide, except for dwellings with masonry veneer, in which case no trim around doors or windows is 
required. However, an addition to or modification of an existing dwelling shall not be required to have window and door trim that is wider than that of the existing dwelling. 
(C)  Vertical corner boards at least three and one-half (31/2) inches wide shall be provided on all dwelling corners, except where the dwelling has a masonry veneer. 
(D)  Any exterior wooden elements on a dwelling's façade facing a required front yard shall be painted or be stained with an opaque stain. 
(5)  Porches: 
(A)  Single-family and two-family dwellings shall have a front porch at least one-half (1/2) the width of the dwelling's façade, and having a depth of at least six (6) feet. The front porch shall face the primary front yard. 
(B)  For new and existing dwellings, the front porch shall not be enclosed with siding. 
(C)  Front porch railings shall have a top and bottom rail. Baluster ends shall not be exposed. 
(D)  Front porch columns shall be uniform in shape and style and be at least five (5) inches wide at their bottom and top. Front porch columns shall have a base and cap that are at least one (1) inch thick and are at least one hundred twenty (120) percent of the width of the column. 
(E)  The underside of front porches and stairways between pier supports shall be enclosed. 
(6)  Garages and additions: 
(A)  An attached or detached garage or carport shall be offset at least twenty-four (24) inches behind the front façade of the dwelling. Bay doors facing a street shall have panel insets or windows. An attached garage shall not make up more than thirty-three (33) percent of the front façade of the dwelling. 
(B)  An addition to an existing dwelling shall be located on the rear or side of the dwelling, except a porch constructed in accordance with Section 36.2-332(c)(5) may be added to the front of the dwelling. An addition to the side of a dwelling shall be set back from the dwelling's front face by twenty-four (24) inches or more. When an existing dwelling does not have a front porch, an addition may be constructed on the front of the dwelling if it includes a front porch constructed in accordance with Section 36.2-332(c)(5). 
(Ord. No. 37633, § 5, 11-20-06; Ord. No. 37984, § 3, 12-17-07; Ord. No. 39122, § 1, 5-16-11; Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12) 
Sec. 36.2-333. - Floodplain Overlay District (F). 
(a)  General Provisions. 
(1)  Statutory authorization and purpose. This section is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to localities by Section 15.2 - 2280 of the Virginia Code (1950), as amended. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of life and property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by regulating uses, activities, and development which, alone or in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities, and frequencies; restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and development from locating within districts subject to flooding; requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do occur in flood-prone districts to be protected and/or flood-proofed against flooding and flood damage; and protecting individuals from buying land and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 
(2)  Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all privately and publicly owned lands within the jurisdiction of the City and identified as areas of special flood hazard determined by the City or shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or included in the flood insurance study (FIS) that are provided to the City by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
(3)  Compliance and liability. No land shall hereafter be developed and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this section and any other applicable sections and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this section. 
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study, but does not imply total flood protection. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This section does not imply that districts outside the floodplain district or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. 
This section shall not create liability on the part of the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(4)  Records. Records of actions associated with administering this section shall be kept on file and maintained by or under the direction of the Zoning Administrator in perpetuity. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. To the extent that the provisions are more restrictive, this section supersedes any section currently in effect in flood-prone districts. To the extent that any other existing law or regulation is more restrictive or does not conflict with this section, it shall remain in full force and effect. 
These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing sections including subdivision regulations, zoning ordinances or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance or section, the more restrictive shall govern. 
(6)  Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this section shall be declared invalid for any reason whatever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this section. The remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect; and for this purpose, the provisions of this section are hereby declared to be severable. 
(7)  Penalty for violations. Section 36.2-571 of the City Code contains the provisions for enforcement of this section and penalties that apply for violations. 
(b)  Definitions. Certain terms and words used in this section shall be defined as set forth below. Where any conflict exists between the definitions below and those set forth in Appendix A, the definitions of this subsection shall govern for the purposes of the regulations of this section. 
    Appurtenant or accessory structure: Accessory structures not to exceed two hundred (200) square feet. 
    Areas of shallow flooding: A special flood hazard area with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Base flood: The flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation: The water surface elevations of the base flood, that is, the flood level that has a one (1) percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year. The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the datum specified on the community's flood insurance rate map. For the purposes of this section, the base flood is the one (1) percent annual chance flood. 
    Basement: Any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study. 
    Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Encroachment: The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    FEMA: Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    Flood or flooding: 
1.  A general or temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from 
a.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or 
c.  Mudflows which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (1)(b) of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
2.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph 1 of this definition. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been made available digitally is called a digital flood insurance rate map. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS): A report by FEMA that examines, evaluates and determines flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and determination of mudflow and/or flood-related erosion hazards. 
    Floodplain: Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. 
    Flood proof: Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. 
    Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization in the watershed. The City requires base flood elevation plus twenty-four (24) inches freeboard. 
    Functionally dependent use: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and shipbuilding and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Habitable space: A space in a building used or capable of being used for living, sleeping, eating or cooking, or used, or capable of being used, as a home occupation. Bathrooms, toilet rooms, closets, halls, storage or utility spaces and similar areas are not considered habitable spaces. 
    Highest adjacent grade: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure: Any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on the city inventory of historic places. 
    Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis: Analyses performed by a licensed professional engineer, in accordance with standard engineering practices that are accepted by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation and FEMA, used to determine the base flood, other frequency floods, flood elevations, floodway information and boundaries, and flood profiles. 
    Letter of map amendment (LOMA): An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a land as defined by metes and bounds or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
    Letter of map revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
    Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of Code of Federal Regulations 44 (C.F.R.) 60.3. 
    Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 
    Mean sea level: Is an elevation point that represents the average height of the ocean's surface (such as the halfway point between the mean high tide and the mean low tide) which is used as a standard in determining land elevation. 
    New construction: For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after November 4, 1981, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. Such structure is also referred to as "post-FIRM." 
    Post-FIRM structures: A structure for which construction or substantial improvement occurred on or after November 14, 1981. 
    Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Repetitive loss structure: A building covered by a contract for flood insurance that has incurred flood-related damages on two (2) occasions in a ten (10) year period, in which the cost of the repair, on the average, equaled or exceeded twenty-five (25) percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event; and at the time of the second incidence of flood-related damage, the contract for flood insurance contains increased cost of compliance coverage. 
    Special flood hazard area: The land in the floodplain subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of being flooded in any given year as determined in subsection (d)(1) of this Section. 
    Start of construction: For other than new construction and substantial improvement, under the Coastal Barriers Resource Act (P.L. - 97-348), means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of the construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure: For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a period of five (5) years, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes repetitive loss structures or structures that that have incurred substantial damage regardless or the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
2.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the City's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this section is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(c)  Administration. 
(1)  Designation of the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations. The Zoning Administrator may delegate duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and other employees. 
(2)  Duties and Responsibilities of the Zoning Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the Zoning Administrator shall include but are not limited to: 
(A)  Review applications for permits to determine whether proposed activities will be located in the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
(B)  Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide available base flood elevation and flood hazard information. 
(C)  Review applications to determine whether proposed activities will be reasonably safe from flooding and require new construction and substantial improvements to meet the requirements of these regulations. 
(D)  Review applications to determine whether all necessary permits have been obtained from the Federal, State or local agencies from which prior or concurrent approval is required; in particular, permits from state agencies for any construction, reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a dam, reservoir, or waterway obstruction (including bridges, culverts, structures), any alteration of a watercourse, or any change of the course, current, or cross section of a stream or body of water, including any change to the 100-year frequency floodplain of free-flowing non-tidal waters of the State. 
(E)  Verify that applicants proposing an alteration of a watercourse have notified adjacent communities, the Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management), and other appropriate agencies (Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, United States Army Corps of Engineers) and have submitted copies of such notifications to FEMA.

(L)  Advise the Board of Zoning Appeals regarding the intent of these regulations and, for each application for a variance, prepare a staff report and recommendation. 
(M)  Administer the requirements related to proposed work on existing buildings: 
(i)  Make determinations as to whether buildings and structures that are located in flood hazard areas and that are damaged by any cause have been substantially damaged. 
(ii)  Make reasonable efforts to notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain a permit to repair, rehabilitate, or reconstruct. Prohibit the non-compliant repair of substantially damaged buildings except for temporary emergency protective measures necessary to secure a property or stabilize a building or structure to prevent additional damage. 
(N)  Notify FEMA when the corporate boundaries of the City have been modified and: 
(i)  Provide a map that clearly delineates the new corporate boundaries or the new area for which the authority to regulate pursuant to these regulations has either been assumed or relinquished through annexation; and 
(ii)  If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas that have flood zones that have regulatory requirements that are not set forth in these regulations, prepare amendments to these regulations to adopt the FIRM and appropriate requirements, and submit the amendments to the governing body for adoption; such adoption shall take place at the same time as or prior to the date of annexation and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
(3)  Use and interpretation of flood insurance rate maps. The Zoning Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard areas, floodplain boundaries, and floodway boundaries. The following shall apply to the use and interpretation of FIRMs and data: 
(A)  Where field surveyed topography indicates that adjacent ground elevations: 
(i)  Are below the base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as special flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of these regulations; or 
(ii)  Are above the base flood elevation and the area is labelled as a SFHA on the FIRM, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area from the SFHA. 
(B)  In FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been identified and in areas where FEMA has not identified SFHAs, any other flood hazard data available from a federal, state, or other source shall be reviewed and reasonably used. 
(C)  Base flood elevations and designated floodway boundaries on FIRMs and in FISs shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway boundaries by any other sources if such sources show reduced floodway widths and/or lower base flood elevations. 
(D)  Other sources of data shall be reasonably used if such sources show increased base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FIRMs and in FISs. 
(E)  If a preliminary flood insurance rate map and/or a preliminary flood insurance study has been provided by FEMA: 
(i)  Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and shall replace the flood hazard data previously provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these regulations. 
(ii)  Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall be deemed the best available data pursuant to Section (d)(2)(C)(i) and used where no base flood elevations and/or floodway areas are provided on the effective FIRM. 
(iii)  Prior to issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data is permitted where the preliminary base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or designated floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided by FEMA. Such preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA. 
(4)  Jurisdictional boundary changes. The floodplain ordinance in effect in any adjoining locality on the date of annexation of any area previously within the adjoining locality shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the City for all annexed areas until the City adopts and enforces a section which meets the requirements for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
The City will notify FEMA when the corporate boundaries of the City have been modified and provide a map that clearly delineates the new corporate boundaries of the new area for which the authority to regulate pursuant to these regulations has either been assumed or relinquished through annexation. If the FIRM for any annexed area includes special flood hazard areas which have flood zones that have regulatory requirements not set forth in these regulations, the City shall adopt amendments to these regulations to amend the FIRM and appropriate requirements. Such adoption shall take place at the same time as, or prior to, the date of annexation, and a copy of the amended regulations shall be provided to Department of Conservation and Recreation (Division of Dam Safety and Floodplain Management) and FEMA. 
(5)  District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the Floodplain Districts may be revised by the City where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have been conducted or undertaken by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. A completed LOMR is a record of this approval. 
(6)  Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the Floodplain Districts shall be made by the Zoning Administrator. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of the Districts, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the District boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 
(7)  Submitting model backed technical data. A City's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, a community shall notify the FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data. The community may submit data via a LOMR. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and flood plain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
(8)  Letters of map revision. When development in the floodplain will cause or causes a change in the base flood elevation, the applicant, including state agencies, must notify FEMA by applying for a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) and then receiving a LOMR. 
(d)  Establishment of Floodplain Overlay District and flood zones. 
(1)  Description of special flood hazard districts (SFHA). The various special flood hazard districts shall include the SFHAs. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the FIS and the FIRM for the City prepared by FEMA, Federal Insurance Administration, dated September 28, 2007, and any subsequent revisions or amendments thereto. 
The boundaries of the SFHA Districts are established as shown on the FIRM which is declared to be a part of this section and which shall be kept on file in the Department of Planning, Building, and Development. 
All development within the Floodplain Overlay District is subject to the development provisions found in subsection (e) of this section. 
(2)  Additional requirements in specific special flood hazard areas. 
(A)  Floodway. The floodway is the portion of an AE Zone that is delineated, for purposes of this section, using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one (1) percent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one (1) foot at any point. The areas included in this District are specifically defined in Table 5 of the above-referenced FIS and shown on the accompanying FIRM. 
The following provisions shall apply within the floodway of an AE zone: 
(i)  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently-accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Zoning Administrator. 
Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies for a (CLOMR), and receives the approval of FEMA. Such application shall be accompanied by a resolution adopted by the City Council for the City, endorsing such application. 
If the above items in this part are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of part d of this section. 
(ii)  Permitted uses in floodway. The following uses shall be permitted as of right in the floodway to the extent that they are otherwise permitted in the underlying base zoning district and are not prohibited by any other section, and provided they do not employ structures, fill, or storage of materials and equipment within the floodway which may cause any increase in 100-year flood height and velocity: 
(1)  Agricultural operations, such as farming, pasture, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting; 
(2)  Public and private recreational uses such as parks, picnic grounds, golf courses, boat launching or swimming areas, hiking or horseback riding trails, wildlife and nature preserves, fishing areas, and trap and skeet game ranges; 
(3)  Botanical gardens; and 
(4)  Accessory residential uses such as yard areas, gardens, and play areas. 
(iii)  Special exception uses in floodway. The following uses shall be permitted in the floodway by special exception granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals provided such uses are permitted in the underlying base zoning district: 
(1)  Accessory structures related to the uses set forth in subsections (ii)(1) through (ii)(4), above. 
(2)  Utilities distribution: gas/electric compressor station or substation, or water pump/lift station. 
(3)  Sewage treatment facility or water treatment facility. 
(4)  Quarry and mining operations, including excavation of sand, gravel, or clay, provided no increase in the level of flooding or velocity is caused. 
(5)  Storage of materials and equipment provided that they are not buoyant, flammable, toxic, hazardous, or explosive, and are not subject to major damage by flooding, or provided that such material and equipment is firmly anchored to prevent flotation or movement, or can be readily removed from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
(6)  Placement or storage of a recreational vehicle, provided such recreational vehicle is on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, is fully licensed and ready for highway use. For purposes of this section, a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and if it has no permanently attached additions. 
(7)  After public notice and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, as a special exception, permit the change of a nonconforming use in the floodway to another use not permitted in the floodway, provided the proposed use is permitted in the base zoning district, and the proposed use as proposed to be conducted, shall be of a nature more in keeping with the character of the floodplain overlay district than the use from which the change is proposed to be made. Failure to conduct the use in the manner approved by the Board shall be grounds for revocation of the special exception, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.2-560(e). Where such a special exception has been revoked, the nonconforming status of the use, individually or in combination, shall no longer exist, and future use of the structure or premises, individually or in combination, shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the floodplain overlay district. 
(B)  AE zones with no floodway delineated. AE zones on the FIRM are those areas for which one (1) percent annual chance flood elevations have been provided and the floodway has not been delineated. 
The following provisions shall apply within an AE Zone where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but has not delineated a floodway: 
(i)  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, designated as Zones A1-30, AE, or AH on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the City. 
(ii)  Development activities in Zones Al-30, AE, or AH on the City's FIRM which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one (1) foot may be allowed, provided that the applicant first applies for a CLOMR, and receives the approval of FEMA. Such application shall be accompanied by a resolution adopted by the City Council for the City, endorsing such application. 
(C)  A Zones: A Zones are those areas for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but the one (1) percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: 
(i)  The Approximated Floodplain District shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where a one (1) percent annual chance floodplain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown as Zone A on the maps accompanying the FIS. For these areas, the base flood elevations and floodway information from federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used, when available. Where the specific one (1) percent annual chance flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data, such as the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Floodplain Information Reports, U. S. Geological Survey Flood-Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this base flood elevation. For development proposed in the approximate floodplain the applicant must use technical methods that correctly reflect currently accepted practices, such as point on boundary, high water marks, or detailed methodologies hydrologic and hydraulic analyses. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Zoning Administrator. 
The Zoning Administrator reserves the right to require a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for any development. When such base flood elevation data is utilized, the lowest floor shall be elevated to or above the base flood level plus twenty four (24) inches, or flood proofed to such level when applicable. 
During the permitting process, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain: 
(1)  The elevation of the lowest floor (in relation to mean sea level), including the basement, of all new and substantially improved structures; and, 
(2)  If the structure has been flood-proofed in accordance with the requirements of this article, the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed. 
(D)  AO Zones. AO Zones are those areas of shallow flooding identified as AO on the FIRM. For these areas, the following provisions shall apply: 
(i)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM. Such elevation shall be established by identifying the highest adjacent grad and adding the flood depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated no less than two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(ii)  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
(1)  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified on the FIRM. Such elevation shall be the highest adjacent grade and adding the flood depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two (2) feet above the highest adjacent grade; or, 
(2)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely flood-proofed to the specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(iii)  Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be provided to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(2)  Overlay Concept. The Floodplain Districts described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning Ordinance Map, and as such, the provisions for the Floodplain Districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provisions. If there is any conflict between the provisions or requirements of the Floodplain Districts and those of any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. In the event any provision concerning a Floodplain District is declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, all remaining provisions shall remain applicable and in effect. 
(e)  District Provisions. 
(1)  Permit and Application Requirements. 
(A)  Permit Requirement. All uses, activities, and development occurring within any floodplain district, including placement of manufactured homes, shall be undertaken only upon the issuance of a zoning permit. Such development shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of this section and with all other applicable codes and ordinances or sections, as amended, such as the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code and the City's subdivision regulations set forth in Chapter 31.1, Subdivisions, of the City Code. Prior to the issuance of any such permit, the Zoning Administrator shall require all applications to include compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and shall review all sites to ensure that they are reasonably safe from flooding. Under no circumstances shall any use, activity, and/or development adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system. 
(B)  Site Plans and Permit Applications. All applications for development within any floodplain district and all building permits issued for the floodplain shall incorporate the following information: 
(i)  The elevation of the Base Flood at the site. 
(ii)  The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) or, in V zones, the lowest horizontal structural member. 
(iii)  For structures to be flood-proofed (non-residential only), the elevation to which the structure will be flood-proofed. 
(iv)  Topographic information showing existing and proposed ground elevations. 
(C)  Elevation certificates and floodproofing certificates.

(2)  General Standards. The following provisions shall apply to all permits: 
(A)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be built according to this section and the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(B)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(C)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(D)  New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(E)  New electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities, including duct work, shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(F)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
(G)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.

(K)  The flood carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any watercourse shall be maintained. 
(3)  Elevation and Construction Standards. In all identified flood hazard areas where base flood elevations have been provided in the FIS or generated by a certified professional in accordance with subsection (d)(2)C of this section, the following provisions shall apply: 
(A)  Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure in Zones A1-30, AE, AH and A with detailed base flood elevations shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level plus twenty-four (24) inches of freeboard. In addition, all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities, including ductwork, for new construction or substantial improvement shall be elevated or floodproofed to two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, also known as two (2) feet of freeboard. 
(B)  Non-Residential Construction. 
(i)  New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood level plus twenty-four (24) inches of freeboard. In addition, all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities, including ductwork, for new construction or substantial improvement shall be elevated or floodproofed to two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, also known as two (2) feet of freeboard. 
(ii)  Non-residential buildings located in all A1-30, AE, and AH zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building components below the elevation corresponding to the BFE plus twenty-four (24) inches of freeboard are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. Certain buildings and structures including detached garages, small pole barns, storage sheds, gazebos, picnic shelters, and similar structures may be wet flood proofed. For any development requiring a building permit, a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification, including the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are floodproofed, shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator. 
(C)  Space Below the Lowest Floor. In zones A, AE, AH, AO, and A1-A30, fully enclosed areas, of new construction or substantially improved structures, which are below the regulatory flood protection elevation shall: 
(i)  not be designed or used for human habitation, but shall be used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). 
(ii)  be constructed entirely of flood resistant materials below the regulatory flood protection elevation; 
(iii)  include measures to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. To meet this requirement, the openings must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum design criteria: 
(1)  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different sides of each enclosed area subject to flooding. 
(2)  The total net area of all openings must be at least one (1) square inch for each square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. 
(3)  If a building has more than one (1) enclosed area, each area must have openings to allow floodwaters to automatically enter and exit. 
(4)  The bottom of all required openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above the adjacent grade. 
(5)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other opening coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(6)  Foundation enclosures made of flexible skirting are not considered enclosures for regulatory purposes, and, therefore, do not require openings. Masonry or wood underpinning, regardless of structural status, is considered an enclosure and requires openings as outlined above. 
(D)  Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles 
(i)  In all designated special flood hazard areas, all manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, must meet all the requirements for the zone in which they are located for new construction, including the elevation and anchoring requirements in this section. 
(ii)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either 
(1)  be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or 
(2)  meet all the requirements for manufactured homes in subsection (e)(3)(D)(i) 
(f)  Existing Structures in Floodplain Areas. Any structure or use of a structure or premises must be brought into conformity with these provisions when it is changed, repaired, or improved, unless one (1) of the following exceptions is established before the change is made: 
(1)  The Zoning Administrator has determined that: 
(A)  A proposed change is not a substantial repair or substantial improvement, 
(B)  No new square footage is being built in the floodplain that is not compliant, 
(C)  No new square footage is being built in the floodway, and 
(D)  No new square footage is being created or existing square footage converted for use as habitable space below the elevation of the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard, and (E) The change complies with this section and the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. 
(E)  The change complies with this section and the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. 
(2)  The changes are required to comply with a citation for a health or safety violation. 
(3)  The structure is a historic structure and the change required would impair the historic nature of the structure. The historic structure shall be flood proofed to the extent practical in accordance with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code and FEMA Floodplain Management Bulletin Historic Structures, FEMA P-467-2, as the same may be amended or updated from time to time. 
(g)  Variances. Variances shall be issued only upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that the granting of such variance will not result in unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense; and will not create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
In passing upon applications for variances, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of the zoning ordinance and consider the following additional factors: 
(1)  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. No variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development, or activity within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the one (1) percent chance flood elevation. 
(2)  The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others. 
(3)  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions. 
(4)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners. 
(5)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 
(6)  The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location. 
(7)  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
(8)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
(9)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
(10)  The safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood. 
(11)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site. 
(12)  The historic nature of a structure. Variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(13)  Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this section. 
    The Board of Zoning Appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters. 
    Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense; and will not create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances. 
    Variances shall be issued only after the Board of Zoning Appeals has determined that the variance will be the minimum required to provide relief. 
    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance, in writing, that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the one (1) percent chance flood elevation (a) increases the risks to life and property and (b) will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
    A record shall be maintained of the above notification as well as all variance actions, including justification for the issuance of the variances. Any variances that are issued shall be noted in the annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.

In the event that the Zoning Administrator is unable to determine whether the limitations and prohibitions of this section will be exceeded or violated, no permit shall be issued until a completed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 7460-1, as amended, has been submitted to the FAA, an aeronautical study has been completed by the FAA, and a determination of there being no hazard to air navigation and no violation of the use restrictions contained in subsection (g) above has been made by the FAA and submitted to the Zoning Administrator. 
(i)  Variance conditions. 
(1)  Nonconforming uses or obstructions which are determined by the FAA to be a hazard to air navigation or violate the use restrictions in subsection (g) above shall not be permitted. Nonconforming uses or obstructions which the FAA has determined do not constitute a hazard to air navigation so long as they are mitigated may be permitted provided that: 
(A)  Such mitigation procedures, such as use of lights or markers, shall be installed and continuously maintained at the property owner's expense and shall be required pursuant to and in accordance with specific, written FAA direction, as well as any requirements deemed necessary by the Board of Zoning Appeals; and 
(B)  The Airport's Executive Director has determined in writing that the proposed mitigation procedures will not in any way impact, limit, restrict, or require a change in the Airport's use or operation. 
(2)  A permit may be issued for a nonconforming use that the FAA determines is an obstruction but is not a hazard to air navigation, does not violate the use restrictions contained in subsection (g) above, is properly marked and lighted, and does not interfere with airport operations. 
(3)  All mitigation measures required of and imposed upon any person for a nonconforming use erected, created, or permitted to grow after August 29, 1966, shall be maintained, repaired, removed, and replaced, when necessary, by such person or his successor. 
(j)  Applicability of regulations to pre-existing structures, uses, or vegetation. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (2), below, the requirements prescribed by this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or vegetation not conforming to the regulations as of August 29, 1966, or where applicable, as of the effective date of any subsequent amendment to these regulations. Nothing contained in this section shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to August 29, 1966, or where applicable, prior to the effective date of any subsequent amendment hereto, and is diligently prosecuted, except as to subsection (h) of this section. 
(2)  The owner of any structure, vegetation, or use which existed prior to August 29, 1966, or where applicable prior to the effective date of any subsequent amendment to this section, and which is inconsistent with or in violation of this section or an amendment thereto, shall be required, as a condition of the continued maintenance of such structure, tree, or use, to permit any mitigation procedures deemed necessary including, without limitation, the City's installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) so as to indicate the presence of such object or hazardous use to operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City and not of such owner. 
(3)  No permit shall be granted that would allow a nonconforming use or structure to become a greater hazard to air navigation that it was on the effective date of this chapter. 
(4)  Whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that a nonconforming structure has been abandoned or more than fifty (50) percent destroyed, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would enable such structure to be rebuilt, reconstructed, or otherwise refurbished so as to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the Airport Navigation Overlay District (AN) regulations contained herein. 
(k)  Conflicting regulations. Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations prescribed in this section and any other provisions applicable to the same subject, where the conflict is with respect to the height of structures, vegetation, or use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern. 
Sec. 36.2-335. - River and Creek Corridors Overlay District (RCC). 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of the River and Creek Corridors Overlay District (RCC) is to recognize the Roanoke River and its tributaries as valuable water resources in the City and to designate certain areas along their banks as being critical to their protection in order to ensure that such streams and adjacent lands will fulfill their natural functions. Stream systems are comprised of the stream and their drainage basins. Streams have the primary natural functions of conveying storm and ground water, storing floodwater, and supporting aquatic and other life. Vegetated lands adjacent to the stream channel in the drainage basin serve as a buffer to protect the stream system's ability to fulfill its natural functions. Primary natural functions of the buffer include protection of water quality by filtering pollutants, provision of storage for floodwaters, and provision of suitable habitats for wildlife. The intent of the regulations of this section is to establish performance and development standards in the critical areas along the banks of the Roanoke River and certain tributaries in a manner that protects and restores water quality and conserves surface water functions. The regulations of this district shall be in addition to those of the Floodplain Overlay District (F). In order to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, the regulations of the RCC Overlay District are intended to: 
(1)  Avoid land uses and development activities that pose a danger to, and degradation of, these water resources; 
(2)  Minimize clearing and grading activities or similar activities that disturb or destroy site vegetation, with the goal that the natural vegetation, features, and qualities of properties along the Roanoke River and its tributaries will be protected to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the recommendations of the City's Comprehensive Plan; and 
(3)  Implement additional erosion and sediment control practices, the maintenance and installation of buffer areas of natural vegetation, and the use of best management practices in order to minimize the impacts of excessive soil loss and the adverse effects of nonpoint source pollutants on the water quality of the Roanoke River and its tributaries. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  The City Council may, in the manner provided for amending this chapter, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.2-540, apply the River and Creek Corridors Overlay District (RCC) to properties that abut the banks of the Roanoke River or its unenclosed tributaries. For purposes of the application of this overlay district, any property separated from the bank of the Roanoke River or a tributary by a public right-of-way or railroad right-of-way shall not be deemed to be abutting the bank. 
(2)  Any River and Creek Corridors Overlay District (RCC) designated by the City Council as provided for in subsection (1), above, shall be shown as an overlay to the existing underlying district on the Official Zoning Map. As such, the provisions in this section shall serve as a supplement to the underlying base zoning district regulations. Where a conflict exists between the regulations relating to the RCC Overlay District and those of any underlying base zoning district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(3)  Upon development of any property within the River and Creek Corridors Overlay District (RCC), such property shall comply with the buffer requirements of this section, except those which, as of the effective date of this chapter, have previously secured a vested property right pursuant to Section 36.2-108. 
(4)  Redevelopment of a property, or expansion of existing structures or uses, shall comply with the buffer requirements of this section; however, uses and structures previously approved and constructed in a buffer may remain. 
(5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the applicability of the regulations of the Floodplain Overlay District (F). The regulations of this section are in addition to those of the Floodplain Overlay District (F). When any conflict exists between this section and the regulations of the Floodplain Overlay District, the stricter provision shall govern. 
(c)  Definitions. Certain words and terms used in this section shall be defined as set forth below. Where any conflict exists between the definitions below and those set forth in Appendix A, the definitions of this subsection shall govern for the purposes of the regulations of this section. 
    Best Management Practices (BMPs): A structural or nonstructural management based practice used singularly or in combination to reduce nonpoint source input to receiving waters in order to achieve water quality protection goals. Nonstructural BMPs are nonengineered methods to control the amount of nonpoint source pollution and may include land use controls and vegetated buffers. Structural BMPs are engineered structures that are designed to reduce the delivery of pollutants from their source or to divert contaminants away from the rivers and tributaries. Structural BMPs may include wet detention ponds, detention basins, grass swales and ditches, and infiltration devices. 
    Drainage basin: The area of land which drains to a given point on a body of water. 
    Riparian buffer: A natural vegetated area left undisturbed or an established vegetated area, adjacent to the bank of a watercourse, through which stormwater runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not become channelized and which provides for infiltration of the runoff and filtering out sediment and other nonpoint source pollutants from runoff before it reaches a watercourse. 
    Stream: Any part of a watercourse, naturally occurring or artificially created, for the purpose of conveying water from ground water or surface runoff. 
    Top of bank: The boundary line between a body of water and the land. This line shall consist of the sloping margin of, or the ground bordering, a river or creek and serving to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. It is best marked where a distinct channel has been eroded to the valley floor or where there is a cessation of land vegetation. 
(d)  Riparian buffer requirement. 
(1)  Within the RCC Overlay District, a riparian buffer shall be established and shall consist of all land adjacent to, and fifty (50) feet landward from, the top of the banks of the Roanoke River or the applicable tributary. The fifty-foot buffer width shall be measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the surface water, landward from the top of the bank on each side of the river or tributary. When the landward boundary of the riparian buffer falls within an improved public right-of-way, the riparian buffer shall be defined as the remainder of the improved public right-of-way and shall not extend beyond that public right-of-way. 
(2)  The riparian buffer boundaries shall be clearly delineated on all site-specific plans submitted for approval pursuant to this chapter. 
(3)  The riparian buffer boundaries shall be clearly marked on-site prior to any land disturbing activities, and shall remain marked until all land disturbing activity has been completed. 
(4)  All land disturbing activity within the required riparian buffer shall comply with Chapter 11.1, Erosion and Sediment Control, of this Code. 
(5)  No principal or accessory uses or structures shall be permitted within the area of the required riparian buffer. 
(e)  Riparian buffer standards. 
(1)  To minimize the adverse effects of land use activities on the Roanoke River and its tributaries, a fifty-foot buffer area of vegetation that is effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff, shall be retained and maintained if present, and where it does not exist, shall be established and maintained upon any land disturbing activity, except as provided in Section 36.2-335(f)(1), in any area delineated in subsection (d) above as a riparian buffer. 
(2)  In order to maintain the functional value of the riparian buffer area, indigenous vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. 
(3)  Within the required riparian buffer area, no vegetation may be cleared or otherwise significantly disturbed, except as provided in subsection (4) below, no grading or excavation work may be performed, and no fill or other materials may be placed except as shown on the approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan. 
(4)  Removal of vegetation within the required riparian buffer area shall be permitted only in accordance with the following provisions: 
(A)  Trees may be pruned or removed as necessary to provide limited sight lines and vistas, provided that 
where removed, they shall be replaced with other vegetation that is equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing erosion, and filtering nonpoint source pollution from runoff. 
(B)  Dead, diseased, or dying trees may be removed. 
(5)  All unvegetated areas within the required riparian buffer area shall be vegetated with appropriate riparian, erosion controlling plant material. Riparian material shall be defined as indigenous vegetation which naturally occurs along the river and creek and is suited to local conditions. 
(6)  With the approval of the Zoning Administrator, manmade materials may be used in conjunction with vegetation to stabilize the riverbank or creek bank only where it is shown that vegetation alone will not stabilize the bank. 
(7)  Access paths shall be constructed and surfaced so as to effectively control erosion.

(2)  Any antennas concealed within a modified existing building or structure, where the modification is consistent with the architectural composition of the building, relatively minor in scale, and increases the structure height by no more than ten (10) feet; 
(3)  Any antennas mounted to a water storage tank, where the antennas extend no more than ten (10) feet above the highest horizontal plane of the tank; 
(4)  Any antennas mounted on an existing electric transmission tower, where the antennas extend no more than ten (10) feet above the existing electric transmission tower; and 
Construction of a new structure for such integration or concealment shall not be construed to meet the definition of a stealth wireless telecommunication facility. 
    Substantial change: A modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria: 
(1)  For towers other than towers in the public right-of-way, the modification increases the height of the tower by more than ten (10) percent or by the height of one (1) additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than ten (10) percent or more than ten (10) feet, whichever is greater; 
Changes in height shall be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on a building rooftop; in other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act; 
(2)  For towers other than towers in the public right-of-way, the modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty (20) feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six (6) feet; 
(3)  For any eligible support structure, the modification involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or, for towers in the public right-of-way and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than ten (10) percent higher or volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; 
(4)  The modification entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site; 
(5)  The modification would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or 
(6)  The modification does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment, provided however that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in items (1) - (4) above.

DIVISION 2. - ADMINISTRATIVE PERMITS 

Sec. 36.2-520. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish procedures for permits which do not require administrative or legislative notice, or a public hearing. A public hearing is not required for permits set forth in this division for one (1) or more of the following reasons: 
(a)  Public hearings have already been conducted relating to the permit application, and the permit application procedure for a zoning permit or Certificate of Occupancy is designed to ensure that the proposed use complies with a previously approved subdivision plat, development plan, or conditional rezoning; or 
(b)  The proposed use is permitted as of right in the applicable zoning district. 
Sec. 36.2-521. - General applicability. 
    No development may be undertaken unless all applicable permits are issued in accordance with this chapter. At a minimum, no development may occur until a zoning permit has been obtained from the Zoning Administrator and a building permit is obtained from the Department of Planning, Building and Development. 
(Ord. No. 37984, § 5, 12-17-07) 
Sec. 36.2-522. - Zoning permits. 
(a)  Applicability. The following activities require a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator: 
(1)  The erection, construction, placement, reconstruction, movement, relocation, modification, demolition, addition, or structural alteration of any structure requires a zoning permit issued by the Zoning Administrator, including installation of outdoor lighting, construction or creation of parking and loading areas, and installation of signs and the installation of required landscaping and screening; 
(2)  The change of use of a property; or 
(3)  Clearing, grading, or excavating that affects required dimensional and development standards associated with Article III, Article IV or Article VI of this chapter. 
(b)  Procedures. 
(1)  An application for a zoning permit shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator prior to the issuance or consideration of issuance of any permit. 
(2)  One (1) copy of the application and accompanying plans shall be returned to the applicant by the Zoning Administrator, after the Zoning Administrator shall have marked such copy as either approved, approved subject to conditions, or disapproved, and attested to the same by signature. 
(3)  If a zoning permit is denied, reasons for the denial shall be stated upon the application. 
(c)  Scope. 
(1)  Zoning permits issued under the provisions of this chapter, on the basis of applications and plans approved by the Zoning Administrator, and other officials and bodies where additional approval is required, are deemed to authorize only the use, arrangement, location, and construction indicated in such approved plans and application, and no other. Any use, arrangement, location, or construction not in compliance with such authorization shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(2)  If the work described in any zoning permit has not begun within six (6) months from the date it was issued, or within the time limits established by a special exception or variance, the permit shall expire. 
(A)  Upon written application submitted by the original applicant, or his successors in title or under law, within ninety (90) calendar days after the expiration of the original zoning permit, the Zoning Administrator may issue a new zoning permit for work other than that involving a variance or special exception, using the original application and plans, if in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator such original application and plans are still adequate. The Zoning Administrator may not issue a zoning permit extending time limits set by the Board of Zoning Appeals, except on specific order of the Board. 
(B)  Failure of a person to apply for a new zoning permit within ninety (90) calendar days after expiration of the original zoning permit shall cause the Zoning Administrator to order such work on the premises involved as may be necessary to remedy conditions which would, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, cause imminent peril to life or property. The failure of any person who was the original applicant for a zoning permit, or who is the successor in title or under law to the original applicant, to do work ordered in such case shall be considered a violation of this chapter. In addition to other remedies and penalties, the Zoning Administrator may, in such cases, order such work done, with charges to be assessed, under procedures provided by law, against the property. 
(d)  Issuance. Whenever a basic development plan or a comprehensive development plan is required, no zoning permit shall be issued until such development plan has been approved. 
(Ord. No. 40088, § 1, 10-20-14) 
Sec. 36.2-523. - Certificates of occupancy. 
(a)  Applicability. 
(1)  New or altered uses: 
(A)  It shall be unlawful to use or occupy any structure or land, individually or in combination, in whole or in part, in which or on which a new use is created or an existing use is changed, converted, enlarged, or moved, until a Certificate of Occupancy is issued. 
(B)  If a zoning permit was not obtained prior to the application for a Certificate of Occupancy, such certificate shall not be issued until approval has been obtained from the City Engineer, or his agent, for changes to or usage of publicly dedicated street rights-of-way. 
(C)  A temporary Certificate of Occupancy may be issued by the Zoning Administrator for a period not exceeding six (6) months during alterations or partial occupancy of a structure pending completion, provided such temporary certificate may require such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public. 
(2)  Nonconforming uses: No person shall renew or resume after discontinuance or abandonment, or change, move, enlarge upon, expand, or extend, any nonconforming use of any land or structure, individually or in combination, in whole or in part, unless and until a Certificate of Occupancy for such use shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator. 
(b)  Procedures. 
(1)  Application for a Certificate of Occupancy shall be made to the Zoning Administrator before any permit shall be issued for the erection, conversion, moving, or enlargement of any structure, or for the creation of a new use or change of use of any land or premises. 
(2)  A Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued only upon completion of the work in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, after inspection by the Zoning Administrator indicates that the use and occupancy are in compliance with the application and the provisions of this chapter. Such application for new uses or altered uses shall require the approval by signature of the Zoning Administrator. 
(3)  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to and may, pursuant to the procedures provided in Section 36.2-561 for authorization of variances, upon appeal of an applicant to the Zoning Administrator for a Certificate of Occupancy for a nonconforming use, and upon showing made to the Board that the nonconforming use was existing on or prior to the effective date of this chapter, or prior to a subsequent amendment of this chapter making such use nonconforming, that it has not been discontinued for a period of time exceeding two (2) years after the aforesaid date, and that such use is not detrimental to the neighborhood, direct the issuance by the Zoning Administrator of a Certificate of Occupancy for such nonconforming use. 
(c)  Scope. Certificates of Occupancy issued under the provisions of this chapter, on the basis of applications and plans approved by the Zoning Administrator, and other officials and bodies where additional approval is required, are deemed to authorize only the use, arrangement, location, and construction indicated in such approved plans and application, and no other. Any use, arrangement, location, or construction not in compliance with such authorization shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
(d)  Records. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a record of all Certificates of Occupancy, and a copy shall be furnished to any person on request. 
DIVISION 3. - CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS 

Sec. 36.2-530. - Certificates of appropriateness. 
(a)  Purpose. This section is designed to encourage the preservation and enhancement of the City's historic districts and encourage rehabilitation and new construction in conformance with the existing scale and character of the districts. 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  Within the H-1 or H-2 Overlay District, no structure or historic landmark shall be erected, reconstructed, altered, demolished, moved, or restored until a Certificate of Appropriateness has been issued by the Architectural Review Board or, on appeal, by the City Council. 
(2)  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued unless the Architectural Review Board, or the City Council on appeal, finds that the proposed erection, reconstruction, alteration, or restoration is architecturally compatible with the structures or historic landmarks in the applicable historic district. 
(3)  Where a Certificate of Appropriateness is required by this section, the Zoning Administrator shall not issue a permit for the erection, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, demolition, or moving of any structure or historic landmark until such certificate has been issued. Once the permit has been issued, the work shall be routinely inspected to ensure compliance with the terms of the Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance of any structure or historic landmark in the H-1 or H-2 Overlay District. For the purposes of this section, "ordinary maintenance" means any activity relating to a structure or landmark which constitutes a minor repair of any element of a structure or landmark which is, or should be, performed on a regular and relatively frequent basis to maintain architectural and structural integrity. The determination of whether an activity constitutes ordinary maintenance, or whether an installation or modification otherwise requires a Certificate of Appropriateness under this section, shall be made by the Zoning Administrator in consultation with the Agent to the Architectural Review Board. 
(A)  In the H-1 Overlay District, painting shall be deemed ordinary maintenance, provided that the color of a structure is not changed; however, changing the color of paint or the painting of previously unpainted masonry surfaces shall require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(B)  In the H-2 Overlay District, painting shall be deemed ordinary maintenance; however, painting of previously unpainted masonry surfaces shall require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
(C)  In the H-2 Overlay District, the replacement of porches, stairs, awnings, roofing materials, or windows, or other similar modifications to an element of a structure or landmark, shall be deemed ordinary maintenance, provided that such replacement is performed using materials that are of the same design as those on the structure or landmark, and provided that such replacement maintains the architectural defining features of the structure or landmark. 
(5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the demolition of a structure or historic landmark which the building maintenance code official certifies in writing is required for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. 
(c)  Procedures. 
(1)  The Architectural Review Board may authorize its Agent to issue any Certificate of Appropriateness. The Agent, pursuant to such delegation, shall act only upon an application completed pursuant to the applicable district regulations, and shall apply the same guidelines and review standards applicable to the Board. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Agent made pursuant to this delegation may appeal to the Architectural Review Board by filing with the Board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof within thirty (30) calendar days from when the decision is rendered by the Agent. 
(2)  In order to be heard by the Architectural Review Board at its next regular meeting, a complete application for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be made to the Secretary to the Board, on forms provided, in accordance with the rules adopted by the Architectural Review Board. In the event of an appeal pursuant to subsection (1), above, a notice of appeal shall be filed with the Secretary to the Board at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the next scheduled meeting. 
(3)  The Architectural Review Board shall vote and announce its decision on any matter not later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing on the matter unless the time is extended with the written consent of the applicant. The Board shall not reconsider any decision made by it, except as provided for in this section. Having once considered an application, the Board shall not hear substantially the same application for one (1) year. 
(4)  Any property owner aggrieved by any decision of the Architectural Review Board may present to the City Council a petition appealing such decision, provided such petition is filed within thirty (30) calendar days after the decision is rendered by the Board. The City Council shall schedule the matter for a public meeting and render a decision on the matter within sixty (60) calendar days of the receipt of the petition, unless the property owner and the Agent to the Architectural Review Board agree to an extension. The City Council may affirm the decision of the Board, reverse or modify the Board's decision, in whole or in part, or refer the matter back to the Board. 
(5)  Upon approval by the Architectural Review Board, or the City Council on appeal, of any erection, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition, a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be made available to the applicant. 
(6)  In the event City Council denies an appeal of a decision of the Architectural Review Board, the applicant may file an appeal in Circuit Court pursuant to subsection (d), below. 
(d)  Appeals from City Council decision. Any property owner aggrieved by any final decision of the City Council pursuant to this section may present to the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke a petition setting forth the alleged illegality of the action of the City Council, provided such petition is filed within thirty (30) calendar days after the final decision is rendered by the City Council. The filing of such petition shall stay any action pursuant to the decision of the City Council pending the outcome of the appeal to the court, except that the filing of such petition shall not stay any action pursuant to the decision of the City Council if such decision denies the right to demolish a structure or historic landmark. The court may reverse or modify the decision of City Council, in whole or in part, if it finds upon review that the decision of the City Council is contrary to law or that its decision is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of discretion, or the court may affirm the decision of the City Council. 
(e)  Scope. A Certificate of Appropriateness is valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of the action of the Architectural Review Board or the City Council on appeal. 
(f)  Demolition; offer to sell. 
(1)  In addition to the right of appeal of the City Council's decision as set forth in Section 36.2-530(d), the owner of a structure or historic landmark within the H-1 or H-2 Overlay District, the demolition of which is subject to this section, shall have the right to demolish such structure or landmark provided that:

(C)  No bona fide contract binding upon all parties thereto, shall have been executed for the sale of any such structure or landmark and the land pertaining thereto, prior to the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in the time schedule in subsection (2), below. 
(2)  The time schedule for offers to sell shall be as follows: 
(A)  Three (3) months when the offering price is less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00); 
(B)  Four (4) months when the offering price is twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or more but less than forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00); 
(C)  Five (5) months when the offering price is forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) or more but less than fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000.00); 
(D)  Six (6) months when the offering price is fifty-five thousand dollars ($55,000.00) or more but less than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00); 
(E)  Seven (7) months when the offering price is seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) or more but less than ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00); and 
(F)  Twelve (12) months when the offering price is ninety thousand dollars ($90,000.00) or more. 
(3)  Before making a bona fide offer to sell, as provided above, an owner shall first file a statement with the Secretary to the Architectural Review Board identifying the property and stating the offering price, the date the offer of sale is to begin, and the name of the real estate agent. No time period as set forth in the schedule in subsection (2), above, shall begin to run until such statement has been filed. Within fourteen (14) business days of receipt of such statement, the Secretary to the Board shall distribute copies to the City Council, the Architectural Review Board, and the City Manager. 
(4)  Such bona fide offer to sell, in accordance with the provisions of this section, must be made within one (1) year after a final decision by the City Council. If not, an owner must renew his request to the City Council to approve such demolition in order to demolish a structure or historic landmark. 
(5)  Any appeal taken pursuant to Section 36.2-530(d), shall not affect the right of the owner of a structure or historic landmark to make the bona fide offer to sell referred to above.

(5)  Once City Council has considered an application, an applicant may not request consideration of substantially the same application for one (1) year. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit City Council's ability to reconsider an application under Rule 10 of Section 2-15, Rules of procedure, of this Code. 
(d)  Planning Commission action. 
(1)  All proposed amendments to this chapter shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for consideration and recommendation. The Planning Commission shall study proposals to determine:

(B)  When pertaining to a change in the district classification of property, the effect of the change, if any, on the property and on the surrounding neighborhood; 
(C)  When pertaining to a change in the district classification of property, the amount of undeveloped land in the general area and in the City having the same district classification as requested; and 
(D)  The relationship of the proposed amendment to the purposes of the general planning program, with appropriate consideration as to whether the proposed change will further the purposes of this chapter and the City's Comprehensive Plan.

(3)  Within sixty (60) calendar days from the date that any proposed amendment is referred to it (unless a longer period shall have been established by mutual agreement between the applicant and the Planning Commission inthe particular case), the Planning Commission shall submit its report and recommendation to the City Council. The recommendation of the Planning Commission shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on City Council. If the Planning Commission does not submit its report within the prescribed time, the City Council may proceed to act on the amendment, without further awaiting the recommendation of the Planning Commission. 
(e)  City Council hearing. Prior to amending the provisions of this chapter or the Official Zoning Map, the City Council shall conduct a public hearing on such proposed amendment, after notice of such hearing is given pursuant to Section 36.2-540(f). 
(f)  Notice of hearing. Prior to conducting any public hearing required by this chapter before the City Council or the Planning Commission, notice shall be given as required by Section 15.2-2204 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended.

No decision or recommendation by either the Planning Commission for the City of Roanoke, the City Council for the City of Roanoke or the Board of Zoning Appeals for the City of Roanoke shall be subject to challenge solely on the ground that the zoning administrator failed to comply with the requirement of posting a sign on the subject property. 
(g)  Amendment after hearing; City Council action.

(Ord. No. 40088, § 1, 10-20-14; Ord. No. 40296, § 1, 7-6-15; Ord. No. 40710, § 1, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 36.2-541. - Conditional rezonings. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement conditional rezoning authority pursuant to Section 15.2-2296 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, in order to provide for the orderly development of land in a manner that provides for a more flexible and adaptable zoning method to permit differing land uses and at the same time to recognize effects of change. It is the purpose of conditional rezoning to provide a flexible and adaptable zoning method to cope with situations whereby a zoning classification may be allowed subject to certain conditions proffered by the applicant for the protection of the community that are not generally applicable to land similarly zoned. 
(b)  Applicability. Conditional rezonings may be granted pursuant to the provisions of Sections 15.2-2296 through 15.2-2302, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. A conditional rezoning may be initiated only by application of the owner, contract purchaser with the owner's written consent, or the owner's agent of the property which is the subject of the proposed zoning map amendment. The owner must sign such application if conditions are proffered. 
(c)  Procedures. The procedures for the filing and approval of a conditional rezoning shall be the same as the procedures to amend the Official Zoning Map as set forth in Section 36.2-540, subsections (c) through (f), except as otherwise provided in this section. The acceptance of proffers or other conditions, enforcement, recordation, amendments, and variations of conditions, shall be as set forth in the provisions of Sections 15.2-2296 through 15.2-2303, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. Procedures specifically applicable to a request for a conditional rezoning shall be as follows: 
(1)  The owners of property for which an application is being made for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map may, as part of the application, voluntarily proffer, in writing, reasonable conditions which shall be in addition to the regulations of the zoning district classification requested by the application. Any conditions proffered by application of a property owner shall be drafted in such a way that they are clearly understood and enforceable and shall adhere to the following standards: 
(A)  The rezoning itself must give rise for the need for the conditions; 
(B)  The conditions shall have a reasonable relation to the rezoning; 
(C)  The conditions shall not include a cash contribution to the City; 
(D)  The conditions shall not include mandatory dedication of real or personal property for open space, parks, schools, fire departments, or other public facilities not otherwise provided for in Section 15.2-2241, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended; 
(E)  The conditions shall not include a requirement that the applicant create a property owners' association under Chapter 26 (Section 55-508 et seq.) of Title 55, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended; 
(F)  The conditions shall not include payment for or construction of off-site improvements except those provided for in Section 15.2-2241, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended; 
(G)  No condition shall be proffered that is not related to the physical development or physical operation of the property; and 
(H)  All such conditions shall be in conformity with the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  Such conditions may be proffered prior to the public hearing before the Planning Commission. Alternatively, or in addition, in consideration of comments expressed during the Commission deliberations on an application, the property owner may, prior to the final public hearing conducted by the City Council, choose to proffer original conditions or revised conditions. The City Council may also accept amended proffers once the public hearing has begun if the amended proffers do not materially affect the overall proposal. 
(d)  Approval criteria. The decision as to whether to accept a condition or a proffer shall be considered a legislative decision, and shall be committed to the sole discretion of the City Council subject to any criteria set forth in the applicable provisions of Sections 15.2-2296 through 15.2-2302, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, or any other applicable provision of state or federal law. 
(e)  Scope of approval. 
(1)  Proffered conditions shall be considered supplemental to and in addition to the provisions contained elsewhere in this chapter or other City ordinances and shall not authorize less than full compliance with all other applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Once proffered and accepted by the City Council as part of an amendment to the Official Zoning Map, such conditions shall continue in full force and effect until a subsequent amendment changes such conditions or the zoning on the property covered by the conditions; however, the conditions shall continue if the subsequent amendment is part of a comprehensive implementation of a new or substantially revised zoning ordinance. 
(3)  Conditions once proffered and accepted by the City Council shall immediately become effective with approval of the application to amend the Official Zoning Map. Upon approval, any development plan, subdivision plat, or development plan submitted for the development of the property in question shall be in conformance with all proffered conditions, and no development shall be approved by any City official in the absence of such conformance. 
(f)  Recording of conditions. The Official Zoning Map shall show by an appropriate symbol on the map the existence of conditions attached to the zoning district designation on the map. The Zoning Administrator shall keep in the Department of Planning, Building and Development and make available for public inspection a conditional zoning index. Such index shall provide ready access to each ordinance creating such conditions. The index shall also provide ready access to all proffered cash payments and expenditures disclosure reports prepared by the City Council pursuant to Section 15.2-2303.2, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. The Zoning Administrator shall update the index annually and no later than November of each year. 
(g)  Enforcement of conditions. 
(1)  Failure to meet all conditions of a conditional rezoning shall constitute cause to deny the issuance of any required permit or certificate, as may be appropriate, and to seek such remedy as provided under the terms of this chapter. The Zoning Administrator (See Section 15.2-2286.4, Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended) shall be vested with all necessary authority on behalf of the City Council to administer and enforce such conditions as may be attached to an amendment of the Official Zoning Map, including: 
(A)  The ordering in writing of the remedy of any noncompliance with such conditions; 
(B)  The bringing of legal action to ensure compliance with such conditions, including injunction, abatement, or other appropriate action or proceeding; and 
(C)  Requiring a guarantee, satisfactory to the City Council, in an amount sufficient for and conditioned upon the construction of any physical improvements required by the conditions, or a contract for the construction of such improvements and the contractor's guarantee, in like amount and so conditioned, which guarantee shall be reduced or released by the Zoning Administrator upon the submission of satisfactory evidence that construction of such improvements has been completed in whole or in part. 
(2)  Any zoning applicant or any other person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning Administrator made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), above, may petition the City Council for review of the decision of the Zoning Administrator. All petitions for review shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator and the City Clerk within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the decision for which review is sought and shall specify the grounds upon which the petitioner is aggrieved. 
(h)  Amendment of conditions. Amendment of conditions created pursuant to this section shall be made only as an original application for amendment to the zoning ordinance, pursuant to the procedures set forth in this division including public notice and hearing.

DIVISION 5. - DEVELOPMENT PLANS 

Sec. 36.2-550. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the development plan regulations is to ensure compliance with the general purposes of this chapter and the City's Comprehensive Plan. The development plan regulations are intended to maintain or enhance the character and integrity of residential neighborhoods and commercial and industrial areas by promoting excellence of development, preventing traffic hazards or congestion, preventing undue land or site hazards, and encouraging the most appropriate development and use of land in harmony with the neighborhood.

(b)  Combination of lots. When a basic or comprehensive development plan involves multiple lots of record, internal lot lines shall be vacated, relocated, or otherwise altered as a part of an otherwise valid and properly recorded plat of subdivision or resubdivision to create a single lot of record. This requirement may be waived by the Zoning Administrator whenever a new building is not being erected across a lot line, and the new construction consists entirely of a fence, a ramp for handicap accessibility, an addition to an existing single-family dwelling, or an accessory structure whenever the existing dwelling or accessory structure is already located on a lot line. 
(c)  Pre-application meeting. Prior to a formal submission of a development plan for review and approval, the applicant should meet with the Zoning Administrator to determine whether a basic or comprehensive development plan is required and what information must be provided. 
(d)  General review guidelines. Review of a development plan shall entail consideration of all aspects of the proposed development necessary to carry out the intent of this division and shall include a review of: 
(1)  The compatibility of the development with its environment and provision for such things as grading, screening, buffering, lighting, and landscaping; 
(2)  The ability of the development to provide for parking areas and the convenient and safe internal and external movement of vehicles and pedestrians; and

(e)  Scope of approval. 
(1)  Upon receipt of an approved and signed copy of the development plan, and provided that all other requirements of this chapter have been met, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a zoning permit to the applicant. 
(2)  An approved basic or comprehensive development plan shall expire and be null and void unless a building permit has been issued or use of the land has commenced within five (5) years from the date of approval. Upon request, revalidation of the development plan may be granted for an additional six (6) months if all factors of the original development plan review are the same, provided that written notice requesting revalidation shall be received by the Zoning Administrator prior to expiration of the original five-year period. 
(f)  Building permits and Certificates of Occupancy. All building permits and Certificates of Occupancy shall require compliance with the provisions of the approved basic or comprehensive development plan. 
(g)  Phasing. In order to enforce compliance with permit conditions, a development plan may be approved in phases, subject to a condition that building permits and Certificates of Occupancy in a phase of the development may be withheld subject to compliance with permit conditions in a prior phase. 
(h)  If the development requires the installation of public improvements, such as street dedication, utilities, stormwater facilities, erosion and sediment and control measures, or any public improvements, any one (1) or more of the documents set forth below may be required. In all such instances of the need to submit any one (1) or more of the agreements and/or guarantees below, the preparer of the comprehensive development plan shall submit a schedule of cost estimates in unit quantities, with totals, for all proposed public improvements, erosion and sediment controls practices, and stormwater management measures, as part of the comprehensive development plan submittal.

(a)  Applicability. A basic development plan shall be submitted as part of a zoning permit application for the following activities: 
(1)  Construction of, reconstruction of, relocation of, or addition to a single-family detached dwelling, a single-family attached dwelling, a two-family dwelling or permitted accessory structure and including associated grading and clearing, where such grading and clearing does not involve adjoining lots; or, 
(2)  Construction of, reconstruction of, relocation of, or addition to a single-family attached dwelling, a two-family dwelling or permitted accessory structure and including associated grading and clearing, on any lot within a subdivision with a valid subdivision site plan; or 
(3)  Construction of any structure, parking, or other impervious surface during which less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of area will be disturbed;

DIVISION 6. - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS, VARIANCES, AND APPEALS 

Sec. 36.2-560. - Special exceptions. 
(a)  Applicability. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide on applications for such special exceptions as may be authorized by this chapter. 
(b)  Procedures. 
(1)  Applications for special exceptions may be made by any property owner, tenant, government official, department, board, or bureau. Such application shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator in accordance with rules adopted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Upon receipt of a complete application for a special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing after giving notice as provided in Section 15.2-2204, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. However, when giving any required notice to the owners, their agents, or the occupants of abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property affected, the Board may give such notice by first class mail rather than by registered or certified mail. In addition to meeting the requirements of Section 15.2-2204, and as a courtesy to the general public, the Zoning Administrator shall erect a sign indicating the nature of the special exception requested, identification of the subject property, and the time, date, and place of such public hearing at least ten (10) business days prior to the public hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals. Failure by the Zoning Administrator to comply with the requirement of posting a sign on the subject property shall not be a ground for cancelling, rescheduling or continuing a public hearing at the request of any applicant or interested person or entity on any matter otherwise properly advertised for public hearing in accordance with Section 15.2-2204 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. No decision or recommendation by either the Planning Commission for the City of Roanoke, the City Council for the City of Roanoke or the Board of Zoning Appeals for the City of Roanoke shall be subject to challenge solely on the ground that the zoning administrator failed to comply with the requirement of posting a sign on the subject property. The expense of legal advertisement required by Section 15.2-2204 shall be borne by the applicant. Fees for such advertisements shall be as set forth in the City of Roanoke's Fee Compendium and as adopted by City Council in accordance with Section 15.2-107 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. 
(2)  Once the Board considers and renders a decision on an application for a special exception, the Board shall not consider substantially the same request within one (1) year, except when such decision is the subject of a motion to rehear. Any such motion to rehear shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(c)  Standards. In considering an application for a special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine the appropriateness of the application based on the following standards: 
(1)  The use is compatible with the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood by virtue of its height, bulk, location on the lot, and the design and location of parking, signage, landscaping, and other outside activities or structures; 
(2)  The use does not create a demand on public water or sanitary sewer services that exceeds the design capacity of these systems or that would in any way decrease the quality of service to the surrounding neighborhood; 
(3)  The use does not generate traffic on public streets that exceeds the design capacity of such streets and does not create a dangerous traffic problem by virtue of driveway location, site clearance, driveway slope, or other factor; 
(4)  The use does not increase the flood potential in the surrounding neighborhood; 
(5)  The use is in conformance with the setback, yard, frontage, lot area, parking, signage, screening, shading, and other applicable requirements of this chapter as they pertain to the district in which the use is located or to the specific use, whichever the case may be; and 
(6)  The use furthers the intent of the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(d)  Scope of approval. 
(1)  In authorizing a special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such conditions relating to the use for which a permit is granted as it may deem necessary in the public interest, including limiting the duration of a permit, and may require a guarantee to ensure compliance with the conditions imposed. 
(2)  Construction shall begin or the use of land for which a special exception has been obtained shall commence within twelve (12) months from the effective date of such permit; otherwise, such permit shall be void. 
(3)  In the event that the use allowed by a special exception is discontinued for a period of two (2) consecutive years, the special exception permit shall become void. 
(e)  Revocation. 
(1)  The Board of Zoning Appeals may revoke a special exception previously granted if the Board determines that there has not been compliance with the terms or conditions of the permit. No special exception may be revoked except after notice and hearing as provided by Section 15.2-2204, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. However, when giving any required notice to the owners, their agents, or the occupants of abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property affected, the Board may give such notice by first class mail rather than by registered or certified mail. 
(2)  A decision to revoke a special exception shall become final thirty (30) calendar days after the date the decision is rendered, unless appealed. After such effective date of revocation, any activities continuing pursuant to such permit shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter. 
(3)  The right to revoke a special exception permit, as provided in this subsection, shall be cumulative to any other remedy allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12; Ord. No. 40296, § 1, 7-6-15) 
Sec. 36.2-561. - Variances. 
(a)  Applicability. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal or original application in specific cases, variances from the terms of this chapter, pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in this section.

Such application for a variance shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator. Upon receipt of a complete application for a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing after giving notice as provided in Section 15.2-2204, Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. However, when giving any required notice to the owners, their agents, or the occupants of abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property affected, the Board may give such notice by first class mail rather than by registered or certified mail. No variance shall be considered except after such appeal, notice, and public hearing. The expense of legal advertisement shall be borne by the applicant. Fees for such advertisements shall be as set forth in the City of Roanoke's Fee Compendium and as adopted by City Council in accordance with Section 15.2-107 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended. 
(2)  During such public hearing, the chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or the acting chair in the absence of the chair, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall keep recordings, transcripts, minutes, or other records of its proceedings on variances sufficient to make possible court determinations on appeal as to the validity of its findings and its reasons therefor. Such minutes and records of official actions shall be filed in the office of the Zoning Administrator and shall be public records. 
(3)  Following the close of the public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall render a decision, denying or granting with or without conditions the variance, pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth in Section 36.2-561(c), (d), and (e). The concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be necessary to effect any variance from this chapter. 
(4)  Once the Board considers and renders a decision on a variance, the Board shall not consider substantially the same request for one (1) year, except when such decision is the subject of a motion to rehear. Any such motion to rehear shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
(c)  Standards for considering a variance. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, general or special, a variance shall be granted if the evidence shows that the strict application of the terms of the ordinance would unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property or that the granting of the variance would alleviate a hardship due to a physical condition relating to the property or improvements thereon at the time of the effective date of the ordinance, and 
(1)  The property interest for which the variance is being requested was acquired in good faith and any hardship was not created by the applicant for the variance; 
(2)  The granting of the variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and nearby properties in the proximity of that geographical area; 
(3)  The condition or situation of the property concerned is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to the ordinance; 
(4)  The granting of the variance does not result in a use that is not otherwise permitted on such property or a change in the zoning classification of the property; and 
(5)  The relief or remedy sought by the variance application is not available through a special exception process or the process for modification of a zoning ordinance at the time of the filing of the variance application. 
(d)  Conditions and guarantees. In granting a variance the board may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use as it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to ensure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. 
(e)  Conforming status. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, general or special, the property upon which a property owner has been granted a variance shall be treated as conforming for all purposes under state law and the zoning ordinance; however, the structure permitted by the variance may not be expanded unless the expansion is within an area of the site or part of the structure for which no variance is required under the Zoning Ordinance. Where the expansion is proposed within an area of the site or part of the structure for which a variance is required, the approval of an additional variance shall be required.

The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision brought up for review. 
(c)  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of the portions thereof as may be called for by the writ.

(h)  Costs shall not be allowed against the Board, unless it shall appear to the court that it acted in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed from. In the event the decision of the Board is affirmed and the court finds that the appeal was frivolous, the court may order the person or persons who requested the issuance of the writ of certiorari to pay the costs incurred in making the return of the record pursuant to the writ of certiorari.

(g)  Promote planting techniques that ensure the long-term health of landscaping materials; 
(h)  Reduce public costs to taxpayers for stormwater management, air pollution controls, and related infrastructure; 
(i)  Protect property values by requiring site appropriate landscaping; and 
(j)  Mitigate the impacts of intense development on less intense uses. 
Sec. 36.2-641. - Applicability. 
(a)  The provisions of this division shall apply to any construction or other development requiring a basic development plan or a comprehensive development plan pursuant to Sections 36.2-552 and 36.2-553. 
(b)  When a development plan is submitted to expand an existing building or for other site improvements, the requirements of this division shall apply only to those portions of the site that are affected by the proposed improvements. 
(c)  When a property abuts an adjacent jurisdiction, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the specific buffer yard and screening requirements along the boundary after consideration of the zoning designation of the adjacent property. Requirements shall not exceed those that would be required between similarly zoned properties within the City. 
Sec. 36.2-642. - General landscaping and screening standards. 
(a)  General requirements. 
(1)  All portions of a lot which are not included in the calculation of impervious surface ratio shall be landscaped. Landscaping shall include plant materials as may be required by this division as well as open areas covered with grass or other vegetative groundcover. 
(2)  Landscaping within a sight distance triangle shall not include any evergreen tree and, furthermore, shall not include shrubs or ground cover exceeding thirty (30) inches in height above the graded ground level. 
(3)  When a determination of the number of required trees or shrubs, as set forth in this division, results in a fraction, any fraction shall be counted as one (1) tree or shrub. 
(4)  If the development of any portion of a lot includes the creation of a slope of two to one (2:1), horizontal to vertical, or greater, such slope shall be planted with vegetative cover, subject to determination of the Zoning Administrator that the methods of planting will hold the soil in place and that the proposed vegetative cover and rate of planting will ensure stabilization of the slope. 
(b)  Planting materials. Where landscaping is required by this division, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Trees used to meet the requirements of this division shall be selected from the current list of landscape trees approved and published by the zoning administrator. Such list shall specify minimum height or minimum caliper at planting, the 20-year canopy of trees in square feet, and the suitability of each species for parking areas, site canopy, or buffer yards. 
(2)  Where evergreen or deciduous shrubs are required by this division, such shrubs shall have a minimum height of eighteen (18) inches at the time of planting. 
(3)  Existing vegetation which meets the standards prescribed by this division, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, may be preserved and may be used to meet some or all of the landscaping requirements. 
(4)  All required landscaping materials shall meet the specifications and standards of the American Association of Nurserymen. 
(5)  Where the planting of trees which have a height at twenty-year maturity which would interfere with overhead utility lines, the Zoning Administrator may, as a part of development plan approval, permit the substitution of trees with a lesser height at maturity, provided the substitute trees shall be provided at a rate that will result in the same amount of total tree canopy. 
(c)  Screening. Where screening is required by this division, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Screening shall be visually opaque and constructed of a durable material. Where specified, open space may be permitted in the screen materials to allow for air circulation with the open spaces to be distributed throughout the screen structure (e.g., space between louvers or gaps in mesh). 
(2)  Screening shall be maintained by the owner of the property so as to meet the requirements of this division. 
(3)  Acceptable screening materials shall include stockade fences, decorative masonry walls, brick walls, earth berms, and perforated or louvered metal panels. The Zoning Administrator may approve alternative materials where their characteristics and design meet the intent and standards of this division. 
(d)  Landscape plan. For development plans subject to the requirements of this division, the following landscaping information shall be required as part of development plan approval: 
(1)  For a basic development plan, the landscaping information as set forth in Section B-1, Appendix B, shall be submitted; or 
(2)  For a comprehensive development plan, a Landscape Plan as set forth in Section B-3, Appendix B, shall be submitted. 
(e)  Installation. The installation of required tree canopies, landscaping, buffering, and screening shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Only healthy planting materials shall be used for required plantings. 
(2)  The planting of trees shall be done in accordance with either the standardized landscape specifications jointly adopted by the Virginia Nurserymen's Association, the Virginia Society of Landscape Designers, and the Virginia Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects, or the road and bridge specifications of the Virginia Department of Transportation. 
(3)  No temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until either the required landscaping is completed in accordance with an approved development plan or the property owner or developer provides a guarantee in a form acceptable to the City Attorney that ensures installation. 
(A)  A guarantee for required landscaping shall be an amount equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of the plants, related materials, and installation. 
(B)  All required landscaping shall be installed, inspected, and approved within three (3) months of acceptance of the guarantee. 
(C)  During any water emergency declared by the governing body in which the use of water is restricted, the Zoning Administrator may permit the delayed installation of required trees, plants, or screening materials. In this event, the property owner shall be required to maintain the guarantee. After a declaration of water emergency ends, the property owner shall install the required plants within thirty (30) days. 
(4)  No permanent Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until the required landscaping is completed in accordance with an approved development plan. 
(f)  Maintenance. After approval by the Zoning Administrator that all landscaping required by this chapter is complete and in healthy condition, the property owner shall be responsible for the ongoing protection and maintenance of all required landscaping in a manner that complies with the requirements of this chapter and in conformance with the approved development plan. Where necessary to comply with the requirements of this chapter and the approved development plan, dead or damaged landscaping materials shall be replaced by the property owner within six (6) months of notification by the City. 
(g)  Modification of landscaping requirements. The Zoning Administrator may approve in writing a development plan subject to, in whole or in part, alternative landscaping, screening, or buffer yard standards if the Zoning Administrator finds that any of the following circumstances exist on the proposed development site, or surrounding properties, provided any such alternative plan shall provide the equivalent quantity of required vegetative material and shall have no additional adverse visual impact on adjacent properties or public areas or otherwise be inconsistent with the stated purposes of this division: 
(1)  Natural land characteristics, such as topography or existing vegetation, on the proposed development site would achieve the same intent of this division; 
(2)  Innovative landscaping or architectural design is employed on the development site to achieve an equivalent tree canopy, landscaping, screening, or buffering effect; 
(3)  The screening and landscaping for a required buffer would be ineffective because of the proposed topography of the site or the location of the improvements on the site; or 
(4)  The topography of adjacent and surrounding sites would render required screening ineffective. 
(Ord. No. 37633, § 14, 11-20-06; Ord. No. 37984, § 6, 12-17-07; Ord. No. 38423, § 1, 4-20-09; Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12; Ord. No. 41173, § 1, 6-18-18; Ord. No. 41370, § 1, 1-22-19)

Such tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any cleaning or grading on the site, shall be maintained during construction, and shall remain in place until completion of all guaranteed improvements shown on the development plan and final release on all requirements by the City. 
(4)  The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination concerning the degree of damage to any tree, whether replacement of any damaged tree is required, or the corrective measures to be taken to ensure the survival of damaged trees. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the property owner if any trees must be repaired or replaced because of the damage caused by the stress of construction. 
Sec. 36.2-644. - Overall tree canopy requirements. 
(a)  Definition of tree canopy. For purposes of this section, "tree canopy" shall include all areas of coverage by existing plant materials exceeding five (5) feet in height, and the extent of planted tree canopy at maturity shall be based on the "canopy at 20 years" as set forth in the current list of landscape trees referenced above in Section 36.2-642(b)(1). 
(b)  Applicability. 
(1)  This section shall apply to any development that requires submission of a comprehensive development plan or a basic development plan, except that:

Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 39495, adopted Sept. 4, 2012, retitled Div. 5, Off-Street Parking and Loading, to read as herein set out. 

Sec. 36.2-650. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to set forth off-street parking and loading requirements for permitted and special exception land uses, in accordance with the intensity of such uses, in a manner that: 
(a)  Reduces traffic hazards and excessive levels of congestion on surrounding streets; 
(b)  Minimizes impact of driveways on the street system; 
(c)  Reduces conflict between motor vehicles and other forms of transportation; 
(d)  Encourages pedestrian access and alternative modes of transportation; 
(e)  Addresses motor vehicle parking, loading, and access issues; 
(f)  Provides options for the provision of adequate parking; and 
(g)  Is consistent with environmental goals such as stormwater management, clean air, and reduction of the heat island effect of expansive impervious surfaces. 
(Ord. No. 38423, § 1, 4-20-09) 
Sec. 36.2-651. - Applicability. 
    The off-street parking and loading requirements of this division shall apply to any new structure or use, any increase in intensity of use, including an addition to or enlargement of an existing structure, or a change of existing use. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until required off-street parking and loading spaces have been established in accordance with the requirements of this division. The repetitive parking of a vehicle or vehicles in a turf grass area or landscaped area that results in denuded or partially denuded soil shall constitute the establishment of a parking area that does not meet the construction standards of this section. 
(Ord. No. 40710, § 1, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 36.2-652. - Minimum parking. 
(a)  Applicability. 
(1)  Where minimum parking is required pursuant to the dimensional regulations of the district, the required minimum number of off-street parking spaces shall be provided as set forth in Table 652-2, or as specified on the development plan for a planned unit development district. 
(2)  All required off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same zoning lot as the use or structure to be served, except as provided in Section 36.2-652(g). 
(3)  Spaces allocated to a fleet or accessory vehicles necessary for and directly associated with the operation of a business or service establishment shall not, while so allocated, be used to meet the minimum requirements for off-street parking or portions thereof or count toward any maximum parking standard. A fleet shall mean a group of motor vehicles, such as taxicabs, vans, or trucks, operated as a unit in association with a business or service establishment. 
(b)  Calculation methods. 
(1)  When a determination of the number of minimum required off-street parking spaces or the permitted maximum number of off-street parking spaces, as set forth in Table 652-2, results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall be counted as one (1) space. 
(2)  For the purposes of off-street parking calculations, the gross area of any parking garage within a building shall not be included within the gross floor area of the building. 
(3)  When computing required minimum off-street parking spaces, the total number of required spaces shall be based on the use(s) of the zoning lot, or portion thereof. In those instances where there are clearly identified multiple uses on a zoning lot, the minimum parking space requirements of Table 652-2 shall apply to each use, resulting in a total parking requirement when summed, except as provided in Section 36.2-652(f). 
(4)  Handicapped accessible parking spaces shall count toward the number of off-street parking spaces provided to satisfy the minimum parking space requirements of Table 652-2. 
(5)  Where applicable, the provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f) below, may be applied alone or in any combination to reduce the minimum off-street parking requirement. 
(c)  Reduction for proximity to public transit. Where a use is located within one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet of a public transit route, the total number of required off-street parking spaces, unassigned to specific persons, may be reduced to eighty (80) percent of that otherwise required as set forth in Table 652-2. 
(d)  Reduction for on-street parking. The total number of required off-street parking spaces as set forth in Table 652-2 may be reduced by one (1) space for every twenty (20) feet of lot frontage on a street to the extent that on-street parking is permitted along the same frontage. 
(e)  Reduction for first 4,000 square feet. Where the off-street parking requirement for a nonresidential use is based on square footage, as set forth in Table 652-2, the total number of required off-street parking spaces, for the first four thousand (4,000) square feet of net floor area of the use, may be reduced to two (2) spaces. 
(f)  Reduction for shared parking. Developments that contain a mix of uses on a single lot or contiguous lots of common ownership, as set forth in Table 652-1, below, may reduce the amount of required parking in accordance with the following methodology: 
(1)  Determine the minimum parking requirements in accordance with Table 652-2 for each land use as if it were a separate use; 
(2)  Multiply each amount by the corresponding percentages for each of the five (5) time periods set forth in columns (B) through (F) of Table 652-1; 
(3)  Calculate the total for each time period; and 
(4)  Select the total with the highest value as the required minimum number of parking spaces.

(g)  Off-site parking. Where permitted by right or by special exception, the minimum off-street parking requirements of a given use may be met with off-site, off-street parking spaces when, and if, all of the following requirements are met. For the purposes of this chapter, off-site, off-street parking provided in accordance with this section shall not be subject to the definition of, or supplementary regulations for, accessory uses or structures. 
(1)  Off-site, off-street parking shall be located within three hundred (300) feet of the lot of the use or structure served. For the purpose of this requirement, the distance from off-street parking spaces to the lot served shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest parking space to the lot of the use served; 
(2)  Off-site, off-street parking shall be designated for the purpose of the off-site use it serves and shall not be used to meet the minimum off-street parking requirements of another use, unless the Zoning Administrator determines from an Off-Site Parking Agreement as referenced in subsection (4) that the uses for which the off-street parking spaces are designated do not constitute simultaneous use of the parking spaces; 
(3)  Off-site, off-street parking shall either (i) be located on land in the same ownership as that of the use or structure served, or (ii) be subject to an Off-Site Parking Agreement as set forth in Appendix C, which agreement shall be recorded by the property owner with the Clerk of the Circuit Court and a copy filed with the Zoning Administrator. Should the legal agreement terminate, the use for which off-site parking was provided shall be considered nonconforming and any and all approvals, including special exceptions, shall be subject to revocation. Continuation or expansion of the use shall be prohibited unless the use is brought into compliance with the parking regulations of this chapter.

Sec. 36.2-653. - Maximum parking. 
(a)  The following maximum off-street parking provisions shall apply in all zoning districts and to all uses, except where maximum parking is delineated as not applicable in Table 652-2, or as established in Section 36.2-653(c). Although the minimum parking requirements shall not apply to the Downtown District (D), the Commercial-Neighborhood District (CN), or the Urban Flex District (UF), the maximum off-street parking provisions shall apply. For uses subject to maximum parking standards, the provision of off-street parking spaces shall not exceed the following amounts: 
(1)  If the total number of minimum required off-street parking spaces is fifty (50) or less, as set forth in Table 652-2, the maximum number of off-street parking spaces permitted shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) percent of the minimum number of spaces required; or 
(2)  If the total number of minimum required off-street parking spaces is fifty-one (51) or more, as set forth in Table 652-2, the maximum number of off-street parking spaces permitted shall not exceed one hundred forty (140) percent of the minimum number of spaces required. 
(b)  The maximum number of off-street parking spaces permitted, as established in Section 36.2-653(a), shall not include required handicapped accessible spaces. 
(c)  The maximum number of off-street parking spaces permitted, as established in Section 36.2-653(a), shall not apply to parking areas utilizing permeable pavement systems or to parking structures. 
(d)  Maximum parking standards may be exceeded with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Such increase in the number of parking spaces shall be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals by special exception, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 36.2-560; 
(2)  Such increase in the number of parking spaces shall be permitted only upon the same lot as the principal use which the parking is intended to serve; 
(3)  The total number of parking spaces created for any use shall be established by the Board, but in no case shall the total number of parking spaces provided exceed two hundred (200) percent of the minimum number of spaces required; and 
(4)  The approval of such increase shall be based on findings related to unique peak parking demands created by the operational nature of the use, intensity of building utilization unique to the use, or overlapping shifts or demand. Such documentation shall be provided by the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 37984, § 6, 12-17-07; Ord. No. 38424, § 1, 4-20-09; Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12; Ord. No. 40296, § 1, 7-6-15; Ord. No. 40710, § 1, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 36.2-654. - Parking and loading area standards. 
(a)  General standards. Parking and loading areas shall be subject to the following general requirements: 
(1)  All off-street parking areas shall be limited to improved surfaces as defined in Section 36.2-654(b)(1). 
(2)  Unobstructed access shall be provided to and from a street or an alley. 
(3)  Off-street parking areas shall be so designed as not to require or permit the parking of any motor vehicle across a sidewalk. 
(4)  Parking and loading areas shall be so designed as not to require or permit maneuvering to and from a street to access or exit a parking space, except for single-family detached, single-family attached, two-family dwellings, townhouses with individual driveways, and multifamily dwellings with less than four (4) dwelling units on a parcel where maneuvering to and from a street shall be permitted. 
(5)  For lots under common ownership or an otherwise agreed to unified development, the joint use of driveways, frontage roads, and parking areas for nonresidential uses may be required by the Zoning Administrator along collector and arterial streets. "Joint use" means a cross-access easement or other enforceable restriction that provides access between abutting properties. 
(6)  Screening and landscaping of off-street parking areas shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of Section 36.2-648. 
(b)  Construction and location standards. Parking and loading areas shall comply with the construction standards listed below and as shown in Table 654.1: 
(1)  All parking areas and loading areas shall be graded for drainage and have an improved surface, except where an alternative surface is permitted in Table 654-1. Improved surface shall mean concrete, asphalt, bituminous pavement, brick or stone pavers, or a permeable pavement system. 
(2)  Where gravel or a similar surface is permitted in Table 654-1, the Zoning Administrator may require a development plan including satisfactory specifications for a sub-base and the size, tamping, and containment of gravel and documentation that dust will not be generated in an amount in excess of that which would be generated by a paved surface or permeable pavement system prior to approval. 
(3)  Parking areas and loading areas shall be bordered by a curb of concrete, asphalt, or other material acceptable to the Zoning Administrator, as indicated in Table 654-1. Curbing shall not be required if the applicant incorporates low-impact stormwater design practices consistent with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Low-Impact Development Design Strategies: An Integrated Design Approach (June 1999) and Low-Impact Development Hydrologic Analysis (July 1999). 
(4)  When a curb is not provided pursuant to item (3) above, wheel or bumper guards shall be provided, located, and arranged so that no part of any parked motor vehicle will extend beyond the boundaries of the parking area and so that they preclude motor vehicles from driving onto landscaped areas. 
(5)  In any PUD District, the parking and loading area standards will be established on the development plan.

(d)  Protect the public investment in the creation, maintenance, and appearance of its streets, highways, and other public areas;

(d)  In addition to the requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c) above, an application for a zoning permit for any sign to be placed on, or project over, any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public property shall include documentation of meeting, and having received approval for, the requirements of Chapter 27.1 of this Code, regarding encroachments, liability insurance, and an indemnification and hold harmless agreement. 
(e)  A zoning permit for a sign shall become null and void if the sign is not erected within six (6) months after the date the zoning permit is issued. Upon written request and for good cause shown, the Zoning Administrator may grant one (1) six-month extension. 
Sec. 36.2-665. - Removal of abandoned nonconforming signs. 
    The Zoning Administrator may order the removal of any nonconforming sign that has been abandoned. For purposes of this section, a sign shall be considered abandoned if the business or use for which the sign was erected has not been in operation for a period of at least two (2) years. Such nonconforming sign(s) and its supporting structure shall be removed by the owner of the property on which the sign is located, or the agent for the property owner, or tenant or lessee of the property having beneficial use of the property upon which the sign(s) is located, within thirty (30) days of written notice by the Zoning Administrator. 
Sec. 36.2-666. - Illuminated signs. 
    When any sign is illuminated, such lights shall be enclosed in the sign, or if external, such external light source shall be located, shielded, or directed so as to concentrate the illumination upon the area of the sign face and so that the point source of the light is not visible from any adjacent street or lot. If ground lighting is used to illuminate a sign, and the point source of the light is not equipped with shielding to prevent its visibility from any adjacent street or lot, such ground lighting shall be fully screened from view by landscaping material. 
Sec. 36.2-667. - Calculation of sign area and number of on-premises signs. 
(a)  The calculation of the number of on-premises signs and sign area allotment shall be based on the applicable lot frontage for freestanding signs and the applicable building frontage or storefront for building-mounted signs. 
(1)  Any freestanding sign shall be located along the lot frontage from which the allotment for the freestanding sign is computed. 
(2)  Any building-mounted sign shall be located on the building façade from which the allotment for the building-mounted sign is computed. For purposes of a building-mounted sign which is attached to an appurtenance of the building or to an accessory structure not otherwise designed or constructed to support signage, such sign shall be located between the building line of the façade from which the building-mounted sign allotment is computed and the public right-of-way which it faces or, where applicable, within the parking lot which abuts the building façade from which the allotment is computed. 
(b)  The following method shall be utilized in the calculation of sign area for on-premises signs: 
(1)  Sign area for freestanding signs and building-mounted signs shall be calculated separately; 
(2)  Each sign face shall count in calculating total sign area, except that in the case of a double-faced sign, only one (1) sign face shall be used in the calculation of sign area; 
(3)  For signs composed of individually attached letters, numerals, pictures, logos, symbols, or figures, the sign area shall be calculated using the area of up to three abutting or overlapping geometric shapes to encompass all lettering, numerals, figures, designs, symbols, fixtures, logos, emblems, insignias, or other drawings or images. Geometric shapes used shall be limited to square, rectangle, triangle, circle, and ellipse; 
(4)  For signs enclosed by a frame or border or encased by a cabinet, the sign area shall be determined by computing the entire area within a continuous perimeter, enclosing the limits of writing, representation, emblem, or any figure or similar character, together with any cabinet, frame, or other material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed The supports, uprights or structure on which any sign is supported shall not be included in the sign area unless such supports, uprights or structure area are designed to form an integral background of the display; and 
(5)  Any banners which are attached to light poles on a lot, and which bear advertising or commercial images, shall be included in the calculation of the total square footage of freestanding sign area and shall be subject to the maximum total square footage of freestanding sign area permitted based on the applicable lot frontage. In the case of a lot with more than one (1) lot frontage, the freestanding sign area allotment toward which the banners shall be counted shall be the lot frontage on which the light poles are located, or if not along a lot frontage, the more applicable lot frontage, based on distance and visibility, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.

(3)  An electronic readerboard in a CN, D, IN, or CG District shall not exceed twenty-five (25) square feet in sign area. 
(4)  The frequency of change of copy shall be established so that each display of copy remains static with no animation for at least six (6) seconds before changing to new copy. 
(5)  An electronic readerboard shall be controlled so that the night-time illumination level does not exceed three-tenths (0.3) footcandles over ambient light, measured at a specified distance from the sign face. The distance of measurement shall be determined by multiplying the area of the electronic readerboard sign in square feet by one hundred (100). The square root of the resulting product is the distance in feet from which the measurement shall be taken. Electronic readerboard signs shall be equipped with a sensor that determines the ambient illumination and be programmed to dim according to ambient light conditions to comply with the requirements of this section.

(Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12) 
ARTICLE 7. - NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS 

Sec. 36.2-700. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to regulate nonconforming uses, structures, and lots. The intent of these regulations is to: 
(a)  Permit such nonconforming uses, structures, and lots to remain until removed, discontinued, abandoned, or changed to conform with the regulations of this chapter; 
(b)  Recognize that nonconforming uses, structures, and lots are generally incompatible with the character of the districts in which they occur and, as such, in certain circumstances, such continuances should not be indefinite and that the nonconforming uses should gradually be removed in favor of uses, structures, and lots that conform to this chapter and the Official Zoning Map; and 
(c)  Recognize that nonconforming uses, structures, and lots need not be entirely unchanged, and that under certain circumstances may change according to law and the provisions of this chapter. 
Sec. 36.2-701. - Generally. 
    Within the districts established by this chapter, or by amendments which may later be adopted, there exists or may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use, which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. Some of such structures, lots, and uses are considered nonconforming. A nonconforming use, structure, or lot may continue, as it existed when it became nonconforming, until removed, discontinued, abandoned, or changed to conform to the regulations of this chapter. Except as provided within this article, no nonconforming use, structure, or lot shall be changed, moved, increased, enlarged upon, expanded, extended, or resumed after removal, discontinuance, or abandonment, or used as grounds for adding other lots, structures, uses of land and structures, or characteristics of use not in keeping with the regulations for the district in which such nonconformity exists. 
Sec. 36.2-702. - Actual construction begun prior to adoption or amendment of chapter. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun or an affirmative governmental act has been obtained as set forth in Section 36.2-108 prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual construction has been carried on diligently. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing structure has been substantially begun preparatory to new construction, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently until the completion of the new construction involved, within any time limit set by a zoning permit or building permit issued under regulations in effect before passage of this chapter. 
Sec. 36.2-703. - Nonconforming lots. 
    Any lot, legally in existence at the time this chapter was adopted, which does not meet the minimum lot size or minimum lot frontage requirements of the district in which it is located, as set forth in Article 3 of this chapter, may be developed or redeveloped for any principal use permitted in that district. Except for minimum lot size or lot frontage requirements, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to permit less than full compliance with any other requirements of this chapter. 
Sec. 36.2-704. - Nonconforming structures. 
(a)  Where a lawful structure exists at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, which structure could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, bulk, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as the structure is maintained in its then structural condition and is not enlarged or altered in any way which increases any nonconforming characteristic of the structure or nonconforming characteristic of its location on the lot. 
(b)  Should such nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance on the same lot or to any other lot, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. However, a nonconforming sign may be relocated on the same property, if such sign was moved due to highway, utility, or other construction for public purposes. 
(c)  The owner of any nonconforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by an accidental fire, natural disaster or other act of God, or any other accidental means may repair, rebuild, or replace any such structure to its original nonconforming condition as long as the structure is not enlarged or altered in any way which increases its nonconforming characteristic. The owner shall apply for a building permit and any work done to repair, rebuild, or replace such building shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, and any work done to repair, rebuild, or replace such structure shall be in compliance with the provisions of Section 36.2-333, Floodplain Overlay District.

Sec. 36.2-705. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, a lawful use exists of a structure, individually or in combination with another structure, which use is made no longer permissible under the terms of the Chapter as enacted or amended, such use may be permitted so long as it is not abandoned for more than two (2) years and so long as the structure in which such use is located is maintained in its then structural condition. Abandonment means the intentional stopped use of the property, and that the property has been vacant for two (2) consecutive years. Should a structure in which such nonconforming use is located be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, or structurally altered, except as otherwise permitted by the provisions of this article, the use of such a structure thereafter shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(b)  No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, intensified, increased, or extended to occupy a larger square footage of building or lot area than was occupied on the effective date of the adoption of, or an amendment to, this chapter, except as provided in subsection (c) below.

(c)  Nonconforming uses may be expanded with the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Such change shall be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals by special exception, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 36.2-560; 
(2)  Such change to the nonconforming use shall be permitted only upon the same lot as the nonconformity; and 
(3)  Any increase in volume, area, or extent of nonconforming use shall not exceed an aggregate of fifteen (15) percent of the existing nonconforming use in the R-12, R-7, R-5, R-3, RM-1, RM-2, and MX Zoning Districts or twenty-five (25) percent of the existing nonconforming use in other zoning districts. 
(d)  No nonconforming use shall be moved on the same lot or to any other lot which is not properly zoned to permit such use. 
(e)  Any use which replaces, in whole or in part, a nonconforming use shall conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
(f)  Any nonconforming use may be resumed or restored after the structure in which the use is located is damaged or destroyed by an accidental fire, natural disaster or other act of God, or other accidental means without the need to obtain a variance as provided in Section 36.2-561. The owner shall apply for a building permit and any work done to repair, rebuild, or replace the structure in which such use is located shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code, and any work done to repair, rebuild, or replace such use shall be in compliance with the provisions of Section 36.2-333, Floodplain Overlay District. Unless such use is resumed or restored within two (2) years of the date of the natural disaster or replaced within two (2) years of the date of the accidental fire, natural disaster or other act of God, or other accidental means which directly caused its damage or destruction, such use shall only be restored or resumed in accordance with the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. However, if the nonconforming use is in an area under a federal disaster declaration and the use has been damaged or destroyed as a direct result of conditions that gave rise to the declaration, then the owner shall have an additional two (2) years for the use to be restored or resumed as otherwise provided in this subsection. For purposes of this section, "act of God" shall include any natural disaster or phenomena including a hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, high water, wind-driven water, earthquake, or fire caused by lightning or wildfire. Nothing herein shall be construed to enable the property owner to commit an arson under section 18.2-77 or 18.2-80 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as amended, and obtain vested rights under this section. "Accidental means" shall not include any intentional act by the property owner to damage or destroy the structure in which the nonconforming use is located. 
(g)  Where the use of a structure is deemed nonconforming with respect to the number of dwelling units or the residential use designation, unoccupied spaces such as porches, decks, or accessory buildings may be constructed or expanded. 
(Ord. No. 37633, § 17, 11-20-06; Ord. No. 38554, § 1, 7-20-09; Ord. No. 39495, § 1, 9-4-12; Ord. No. 40710, § 1, 12-5-16) 
Sec. 36.2-706. - Repairs and maintenance. 
(a)  On any structure devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, ordinary maintenance work, or the repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be done, provided the cubic content of the building, as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, shall not be increased. 
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, on order of such official; nor shall anything in this chapter be deemed to exempt any such building from any of the requirements and provisions of any other chapter of this Code or any other code or ordinance of the City. 
Sec. 36.2-707. - Change of nonconforming use to another use. 
    After public notice and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, as a special exception, permit the change of a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district, provided the proposed use, as proposed to be conducted, shall be of a nature more in keeping with the character of the district than the use from which the change is proposed to be made. Failure to conduct the use in the manner approved by the Board shall be grounds for revocation of the special exception, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.2-560(e). Where such a special exception has been revoked, the nonconforming status of the use, individually or in combination, shall no longer exist, and future use of the structure or premises, individually or in combination, shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which located. 
Sec. 36.2-708. - Nonconforming characteristics of use. 
    If characteristics of use, such as signs, off-street parking or loading, landscaping, outdoor lighting, utilities, or other matters pertaining to use of structures or lands, individually or in combination, are in lawful existence at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and are not as required by this chapter as adopted or amended, such characteristics of use may be continued, unless otherwise specified in this chapter, but no change shall be made which increases nonconformity with the provisions of this chapter as adopted or amended. 
Sec. 36.2-709. - Certain uses deemed not nonconforming. 
    Uses in existence in a district at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, for which a special exception permit would be required if they were new uses, shall be deemed conforming uses so long as they continue in existence on the same lot. Once such use is abandoned for any continuous period longer than two (2) years, any new use of the premises must conform to the applicable district regulations.

THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into this ___ day of ________, 20___, by and between _______, hereinafter referred to as the "Owner of the Primary Parcel(s)," and _______, hereinafter referred to as the "Owner of the Secondary Parcel(s)," and the City of Roanoke, Virginia: 
WITNESSETH: 
WHEREAS, the Owner of the Primary Parcel(s) certifies that he/she/it is/are the record owner(s) of property identified as Official Tax Parcel(s) No. _____ on the records of the Commissioner of the Revenue of the City of Roanoke, and being the same property acquired by the Owner of the Primary Parcel(s) by instrument recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke in Deed/Will Book _____, page _____, which property is hereinafter referred to as the "Primary Parcel(s)"; and 
WHEREAS, the Owner of the Secondary Parcel(s) certifies that he/she/it is/are the record owner(s) of property identified as Official Tax Parcel(s) No. _____ on the records of the Commissioner of the Revenue of the City of Roanoke, and being the same property acquired by the Owner of the Secondary Parcel(s) by instrument recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke in Deed/Will Book _____, page _____, which property is hereinafter referred to as the "Secondary Parcel(s)." 
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the approval of the City of a development plan for the Primary Parcel(s), and the mutual covenants herein, it is agreed by the parties that: 
Pursuant to the terms of Section 36.2-652, Minimum off-street parking, Chapter 36.2, Zoning, of the Code of the City of Roanoke (1979), as amended, off-street parking space requirements for the proposed use of the Primary Parcel(s), are being satisfied through provision of all or a portion of such required parking spaces, numbering ________, on the Secondary Parcel(s). 
The permanent availability of such parking spaces and associated pedestrian access routes for use on the Secondary Parcel in conjunction with the uses conducted on the Primary Parcel(s) has been established by execution of an appropriate legal instrument, recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke in Deed Book _____, page _____. 
By the signature(s) on this statement, the Owner(s) of the Primary Parcel(s), do hereby acknowledge and agree that should the parking spaces on the Secondary Parcel become unavailable for use at some time as a result of a breach in the recorded instrument, or for any other reason, that an equal number of parking spaces shall be constructed and provided either on the Primary Parcel(s) or through another off-site arrangement. Failure to provide or construct such replacement parking spaces within ninety (90) days, weather permitting, shall be deemed a violation of the City's Zoning Ordinance and shall be punishable in accordance with the penalties provided therein. 
The responsibility of complying with these parking requirements shall run with title to the Primary Parcel(s) and the Secondary Parcel(s), and shall not be affected by transfer by lease or of ownership, as long as the use of the Primary Parcel(s) necessitates provision of off-site parking spaces to satisfy the applicable parking standards specified by the Zoning Ordinance. A recorded statement executed by the Owner(s) of the Primary Parcel, indicating that all or a portion of such parking spaces are no longer required, shall be conclusive as to any release from the requirements of this Agreement by the City.
