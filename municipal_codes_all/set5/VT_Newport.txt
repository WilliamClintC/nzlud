INTRODUCTION
* Zoning is the division of all land in the community into various appropriate districts. Within these districts the use of the land, the height and size of buildings and the other aspects of development are regulated. The locations and standards of these districts are based on the desires of the community laid out in the Newport City Municipal Plan.
* The purpose of zoning is to protect existing development from nearby detrimental development. Residential areas will remain safe places to live and play. Industrial areas will not be hampered by complaints from nearby residences, and those areas that are a mix of residential and commercial development will be regulated so that these uses are compatible.
* Newport first adopted the Zoning Bylaw in 1971 and it has periodically been updated since that date. This updated version is both a revision of the previous bylaw and a re-write of certain aspects of the previous Bylaw to include Form Based Code. The revisions and re-write endeavor to improve its’ organization, bring it into compliance with current State law and with the new City Plan, clarify parts of the bylaw that have been sources of uncertainty and include the Form Based Code(FBC.)
* The Newport City Zoning Bylaw has been established to conform to, and be in harmony with, the Vermont Municipal and Regional Planning and Development Act. Any conflicts that are identified between the two documents will defer to Title 24 VSA, Chapter 117 as the prevailing authority.
CITY OF NEWPORT, VERMONT FORM BASED CODE,

ARTICLE 2: ESTABLISHMENT OF FORM BASED CODE & FBC ZONING DISTRICTS AND BOUNDARIES
§201 Establishment of FBC and Regulating Map.
Newport is hereby divided into the following Zoning Districts as shown on the City Regulating & Zoning Map:
Form 1 Main Street
Form 2 Downtown
Form 3 Urban Multi-Use
Form 4 Urban Waterfront 1
Form 5 Urban Waterfront 2
Form 6 Residential/Mixed-Use
§202 Form Based Code District Regulations
Form-Based Code (FBC) identifies the basic physical characteristics of building sites/zones/street types and determines the Building Envelope Standards (BES) (see pages 10-25) to be applied in accordance with the City of Newport FBC Regulating Map.
Newport’s Regulating Map illustrates disposition of each property or lot and how it relates to its adjacent properties and streets/building sites. All sites/lots described in Newport’s FBC are regulated by street frontage/type and BES.
§203 Intent
Newport’s FBC district is intended to be understood/coded as perimeter blocks with buildings typically placed at the street along the outer edge of their sites or lots. The street type and zone-building envelope standards promote a coherent streetscape throughout the FBC districts. The prescribed standards will, additionally, assist building owners/developers in understanding the relationship between streets, lots, built

environment and the public realm. These standards will endeavor to establish an environment that encourages and facilitates pedestrian activity.
§204 Process/Administration/Issuance
In the Newport City FBC districts, there are two discrete review processes: Administrative Process or Special Requirement Process. Special Requirement Process will require that the permit application be reviewed by the Development Review Board (DRB). Special Requirements are dependent upon site size, project size and/or the need for minor variations/adjustment to the FBC BES standards. Additionally, all permit applications that require Act 250 review shall require DRB review. If the proposed use is a permitted use but Special Requirements Review is triggered the DRB shall only review the proposed permit application utilizing the appropriate form requirements.
Section 604 of the Newport City Zoning & Subdivision Bylaw sets forth the provisions and requirements for the DRB review process However, in the FBC overlay district the criteria for review will be: 1. Regulating Map; 2. BES; 3. Streetscape Standards.
A) Administrative Review
Size Requirements: Projects on sites less than 40,000 square feet or with proposed building square footages less than 30,000 (total) square feet shall be reviewed administratively. If the permit application meets all of the standards of FBC and are also a permitted use, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a zoning permit. Permits will not be issued for building activity until review is completed and a determination made that the proposal is consistent with FBC requirements. All permits will be issued in accordance with standards set for Section 601 of Newport City Zoning & Subdivision Bylaw.
B) Special Requirement Permit Review -DRB.
Special Requirement Permit --DRB review will be required for sites over 40,000 square feet or with proposed building square footages over 30,000 (total)square feet. Such sites/proposed projects will be required to meet the intent and conform to the FBC standards and will be evaluated in those terms. They also must meet the objectives described in Site Plan Review of the Newport City Zoning Bylaw.
The DRB review process for Special Requirement Permits may allow for deviations in the FBC standards-- Examples of these deviations may include problems related to topography or street grade, the location of alley and streets, building breaks and passages between buildings, signs, streetscape details, and design issues related to the inclusion of existing buildings. Where properties of less than 40,000 square feet have such difficulties they shall require DRB Review.
All permit issuance requirements shall be in accordance Title 24 VSA, Chapter 117 and Newport City Zoning & Subdivision Bylaw.

§205 Streetscape Requirements
• In the built environment, the street and building façade receives more attention than the rest of the building. Streetscape elements, such as built edge, brick pavers, benches and waste-bins, throughout Newport’s Designated Downtown and FBC districts must be consistent within a project and should be consistent from project to project within a building activity area.
• Building facades are the public “face” of every building and support the life of the street. Owners/developers are encouraged to utilize recommended Architectural Standards (appendix A) and streetscape amenities—such as planters and window boxes.
• Building rear façades, or the more private, rear portions of the lots (toward the alley) are considered valuable/contributing members to the public realm—to be developed, maintained and are required to adhere to appropriate Streetscape standards.
• Street furniture, bike racks, benches, trash receptacles are required--see BES for specific requirements.
• Street trees are part of an overall streetscape; tree requirements are determined by street type and location—See Tree Chart (appendix B).
§206 Lots, Blocks, Streets and Alleys
• All lots shall share a frontage line with a street or alley (no landlocked lots.)
• All lots and/or all contiguous lots shall be considered to be part of a block. No block face shall have a length greater than 400 feet without an alley, common access easement or pedestrian pathway providing through-access to another street, alley, common access easement or courtyard. Alleys may provide access to the rear of all lots. Alley construction is required as part of redevelopment projects at the rear of property, unless an alley already exists.
• Where an alley does not exist and is not constructed at the time of redevelopment of any property, the developer is required to dedicate the alley right of way within or at the rear of the lot--Alley Type 1 standard—minimum.
Alleys shall be kept clear of debris, stored materials, and illegally-parked vehicles.
• Curb cuts shall be limited to no more than one per 200 feet on primary streets
• On sites with no alley access, there shall be a 12-foot setback from the rear lot line to provide alley or delivery channel access.
§207 Buildings
The hierarchy of BES, in descending order (most dense to least dense), is as follows:
Form 1 Main Street
Form 2 Downtown
Form 3 Urban Multi-Use
Form 4 Urban Waterfront 1
Form 5 Urban Waterfront 2
Form 6 Residential/Mixed-Use
01-28-2019
16
• The maximum building footprint is 40,000 square feet; beyond that limit a special exception is necessary. Large stores may have a maximum ground floor footprint of 50,000 square feet—overall square footage may be greater.
• For each block, building(s) along the "build-to line" shall present a complete and discrete vertical façade composition at an average street frontage length of 30 feet--varies per BES. Each façade on primary or secondary (per BES) streets, shall include a functioning, public entry. This may be satisfied through the use of shops for large footprint buildings
• Consistent BES shall front one another on the Regulating Plan.
• When the Building Envelope/Edge Standard designation changes along a property frontage, the property owner has the option of applying either BES for a maximum additional distance of 50 feet in either direction along that frontage.
• Publicly-owned, civic buildings (e.g. courthouses, municipal offices, etc) may be exempt from prescriptions of this code. The DRB may modify all other provisions of this FBC for publicly-owned, civic buildings in a less restrictive manner.
§208 Building Breaks
The physical design of a building facade should vary minimally at intervals determined by the form standard. Variations can be achieved by utilizing the following techniques:
• Architectural division into multiple buildings,
• Break or articulation of the façade--Building Break Types (see diagram, §211.07
1. Façade height change
2. Vertical surface shift
3. Horizontal surface shift /adjustment—section change
4. Significant material change
5. Arcade/gallery
• Significant change in facade design,
• Placement of window and door openings, or position of awnings and canopies.
§209 Parking
General goals and standards:
• Enable people to park once at a convenient location and to access a variety of commercial enterprises in pedestrian-friendly environments by encouraging shared parking.
• Reduce diffused, inefficient, single-purpose reserved parking.
• Avoid adverse parking impacts on neighborhoods adjacent to redevelopment areas.
• Maximize on-street parking. Provide flexibility for redevelopment of small sites and for the preservation of historic buildings.
• Promote prototype projects using flexible and creative incentives.
Garage and Parking Entrances
• Any garage and/or vehicle (autos, trailers, boats, etc.) parking areas-except where parking is located in an ancillary structure enclosed in a rear-loading town-house garage, or in a below-grade
01-28-2019
17
garage – on private property shall not be located within 25 feet from any build-to-line (except for basement garages) and screened from the street by a street wall.
• Parking access shall be from an alley when possible. Designated garage entries and alleys shall be the sole means of automobile access to a site unless otherwise approved by a DRB special requirement permit.
• Garage doors on residential parking shall not be at an angle of less than 90 degrees from the primary front build-to-line or right of way unless otherwise approved by DRB special requirement permit.
• These requirements are not applicable to on-street parallel or angled parking.
Parking Types
In general, allowed parking is as follows:
• Behind-structure, surface parking: ground-level public or private parking lot that is located in the rear yard behind a building. When possible, access to the parking shall be taken from an alley.
• Parking structure: a building where the primary function is to provide parking. Ground-level, building edge at primary and secondary street fronts shall maintain a pedestrian-related use.
• Tucked-under: ground -level, private, covered parking lot located directly beneath the second floor of building. Tucked-under parking shall not be visible from the public right-of-way unless the right-of-way is a city designated alley.
• Sub-surface/under parking facility that is below grade.
• [Parking next to structure-disallowed in Form(s) 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5.] Parking next to the building is allowed but discouraged in Form 6
§210 Retail General Intentions
Retail is required on the ground level at primary streets and, to a lesser degree, on secondary streets-see specific BES §211. The inclusion of retail enlivens the street and creates a purpose for pedestrians/citizens to make use of the streets. Unless otherwise noted, retail is an inclusive phrase that encompasses consumer comparison—goods, general merchandise, apparel, furnishings and other types of similar merchandise, convenience goods, food/delis, gifts, drugstore items, cards/stationery, business services, restaurants, grocery stores, lodging, hotel, theater, and other uses that provide visual interest and create active street life.
Retail types:
Retail 1: Uses that provide for the direct exchange of goods/commodities with the consumer and/or venues that provide entertainment or leisure activities. Generally Retail 1 promotes high walk-in customer counts, or are shopping destinations. Retail 1 includes stores, restaurants, barber shops, beauty salons, theatre/entertainment venues and hotel lobbies.
01-28-2019
18
Retail 2: Uses that provide business/professional services. Generally, Retail 2 provides essential services that are not typically high-volume foot traffic.
All direct to consumer exchange of goods and services (retail) are divided into these two categories/types. Unless otherwise noted, in BES all ground-floor retail refers to definition # 1: Retail.1. When Retail1 is required on ground level. Retail 2 is allowed on all levels above ground level.

“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specification which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (b) Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
“Top of Bank” means that vertical point along a stream bank where an abrupt change in slope is evident. For streams in wider valleys it is the point where the stream is generally able to overflow the banks and enter the floodplain. For steep and narrow valleys, it will generally be the same as the top of slope.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this bylaw. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

§705 Conditional Uses
No Zoning Permit shall be issued by the Administrative Officer for any use or structure, which requires conditional use approval in this bylaw until the DRB grants such approval. In considering its action, the DRB shall make findings on general and specific standards, hold hearings and attach conditions if any, as provided for in Title 24 VSA, 4414(3).
§705.01 The standards shall require that the proposed conditional use shall not result in an undue adverse effect on any of the following:
1. General Standards:
2. The capacity of existing or planned community facilities.
3. The character of the area affected, as defined by the purpose or purposes of the zoning district within which the project is located, and specifically stated policies and standards of the municipal plan.
4. Traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity.
5. Bylaws and ordinances then in effect.
6. Utilization of renewable energy resources.
§706 Waivers: Where renovation, expansion or new construction is proposed for a residential structure on a nonconforming lot, a waiver of up to 50% of the setback distance (e.g., a 30 ft. setback may be reduced by up to 15 ft.) shall be approved by the Development Review Board if the following standards are satisfied:
1. The proposal shall meet all conditional use criteria. As a condition of approval, the Board may require the mitigation of impacts to adjoining properties and uses through building design, layout, landscaping or screening.
2. The new or renovated part of the building is needed to accomplish the intended goal (an expanded, improved entry deck, for example).
3. The result shall improve the property and the neighborhood.
4. It is helpful or necessary to allow for continued reasonable use of the property.
5. The proposed work or construction shall not encroach any more than necessary to accomplish the desired results.
Any reduction of setback standards beyond 50% may only be granted in accordance with variance standards.
§707 Variance
§ 707.01 Appeal; variances
(a) On an appeal under section 4465 or 4471 of this title in which a variance from the provisions of a bylaw or interim bylaw is requested for a structure that is not primarily a renewable energy resource structure, the board of adjustment or the development review board or the environmental court created under 4 V.S.A. chapter 27 shall grant variances and render a decision in favor of the appellant, if all the following facts are found, and the finding is specified in its decision:
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to these conditions, and not the circumstances or
01-28-2019
90
conditions generally created by the provisions of the bylaw in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) Because of these physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the bylaw, and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
(3) Unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, or be detrimental to the public welfare.
(5) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the bylaw and from the plan.
§708 Site Plan Review
A Zoning Permit may be issued by the Administrative Officer for one-family & two-family dwellings and permit applications that meet the FBC standards for Administrative Review Process. All other permits will require DRB site plan review. Site Plan Reviews shall fall into two categories:
1. Minor Impact Review
2. Major Impact Review
Minor Impact Review permit applications are (unless otherwise determined by ZA) Change of Use permit applications that do not propose changes to the building or site and/or do not require additional parking spaces. See Chart: 708.01

All permits must be reviewed by the Department of Public Works for adequacy of water, sewer and roadways. All new infrastructures must be built to City specifications, except for paving, prior to the creation and transfer of any lot. Paving must be to City Standards within 3 years of initial construction of the road or prior to the sale/transfer of more than 25% of the lots accessed from the road. Copies of the current specifications as approved by the City Council are available at the municipal offices.
01-28-2019
91
Any new Right-Of-Way accessing 3 or more building lots will be considered a road. Any new subdivision off of an existing private Right-Of-Way accessing 3 or more building lots will be considered a new road and will have to be brought up to City Standards. As an example, any lot on a private Right-Of-Way not built to City Standards accessing more than 3 building lots wishes to split their lot in half creating 1 additional lot. The private Right-Of-Way would now have to be brought up to City Standards up to the point accessing the new lot, this includes paving and a cul-de-sac/hammerhead.
An example of the paving requirement would be, we have a new 10-lot subdivision and 2 lots are sold in the first year. The road would have to be paved prior to the sale of the 3rd lot. If the remaining 8 lots are not sold the road would still have to be paved within 3 years of initial construction. Another example would be on an existing private Right-Of-Way, as noted above, the road would have to be brought up to City Standards prior to the sale/transfer of the additional lot.
Site plan review is not for signs unless they impact within the criteria of §708.02(E).
For Major Impact Review permit applications the requirements are as follows in §708.02. For Minor Impact Review permit applications §708.02 may apply pending application—applicability to be determined by the Zoning Administrator.
708.02 The owner shall submit one set and seven (7) full size copies of Site Plan Maps and a Supporting Data Addendum to the Zoning Administrator, two (2) weeks prior to the respective meeting, for necessary copying and submittal to the DRB members. If physical changes to the site or structure(s) are proposed, the Site Plan Map shall include the following—when applicable:
A. Preparer and legend:
1. Name, address and signature of the person who prepared the map, and registry of Deeds Book and Page,
2. Scale, that is the number of feet in one (1) inch on the map; North arrow and date of map completion,

92
2. Name and address of the owners of record of the subject lot(s) and the abutting property owners;
3. Present land use and any deed restrictions or covenants, and if so attached copies;
4. Construction schedule, that is, planned start and finish dates for each phase and/or portion; such as structures, streets and ways, parking and loading areas, landscaping, etc...;
5. Proposed performance bonds.
E. The DRB shall conform to the requirements of Title 24 VSA §4416 before acting upon any application. In considering its action the DRB shall consider and may impose appropriate conditions and safeguards, in a manner that is consistent with the intent of this bylaw and the City Plan, with respect to:
1. the adequacy of parking, traffic access, and circulation for pedestrians and vehicles with particular attention to safety;
2. the adequacy of landscaping, screening, and setbacks with regard to achieving maximum compatibility and protection to adjacent properties;
3. the protection of the utilization of renewable energy resources;
4. exterior lighting;
5. harmonious relationship between proposed uses and existing adjacent uses;
6. the adequacy of drainage control;
7. compliance with all pertinent parts of this bylaw;
8. If the property is in a Special Flood Hazard Area, it must meet or exceed all criteria of section 433 B, Special Flood Hazard Area of this bylaw.

01-28-2019
93
709.04 The predominant use of the land shall not differ substantially from the uses permitted in the district in which the plan is located.
709.05 Lot size, width, front, side and rear yard requirements may be waived; however, these will be evaluated by the DRB on their individual merit.
