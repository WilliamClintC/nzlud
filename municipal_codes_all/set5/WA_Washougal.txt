3.20.020 Source of moneys.

The fund authorized in WMC 3.20.010 shall be funded by treasurer’s check wherein the disbursement shall be debited to a balance sheet asset account entitled “advance travel expense revolving fund” and shall be credited to a balance sheet liability account to be entitled “reserve for advance travel expense revolving fund,” and for such purpose, the amount of $2,000 is transferred to this fund from unexpended and unencumbered sums in the general fund. Upon receipt of such moneys the custodian of the fund shall open a checking account in a local bank to be selected by him, this account to be in the name of the city. (Ord. 1431 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1028, 1991; Ord. 428 § 1, 1970; Ord. 415 § 2, 1970)

Any reimbursement shall first be made payable to the advance travel fund until the advance issued to the traveler shall be paid in its entirety.

(Ord. 415 § 7, 1970)

It must not be used for personal loans, payment of airline tickets, preregistration fees, reimbursement to employees or officers for travel already incurred, etc. (Ord. 1028, 1991; Ord. 415 § 8, 1970)


3.20.090 Advance not to be considered as personal loan.

Any advance made under this chapter shall be considered as having been made to such officer or employee to be expended by that officer or employee as an agent of the city and is not to be considered as a “personal loan.” As such, any expenditure of the advanced funds for other than official city business shall be considered a misappropriation of public funds.

In the event that a monetary donation is conditioned or donated for a special purpose, prior to acceptance, the city manager, department heads or city council (depending on who is accepting the donation under subsections (1) and (2) of this section) should consider the long-term impacts of the donation, particularly where there could be significant future or ongoing operations and maintenance or capital costs associated with the donation. Where the proposed donation is conditioned on the contribution to a city program, purpose or activity that has not first been approved by council, the city manager or department heads shall defer to the city council for any such decisions.

3.58.030 Residential target area designation and standards.

(1) Criteria. Following a public hearing, the city council may, in its sole discretion, designate one or more residential target areas. Each designated target area must meet the following criteria, as determined by the city council:

(a) The target area is located within an urban center.

(b) The target area lacks sufficient available, desirable, and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would likely live in the urban center if desirable, attractive, and livable places were available.

(i) Encourage increased residential opportunities within the target area; or

(ii) Stimulate the construction of new multifamily housing and/or the rehabilitation of existing vacant and under-utilized buildings for multifamily housing; or

(iii) Where appropriate, stimulate the new construction or rehabilitation of owner-occupied multifamily housing, or the conversion of existing vacant and underutilized multifamily rental units to owner-occupied multifamily housing as such property redevelops. 

(d) In designating a residential target area, the city council may also consider other factors, including, but not limited to: whether additional housing in the target area will attract and maintain an increase in the number of permanent residents; whether an increased residential population will help alleviate detrimental conditions in the target area; and whether an increased residential population in the target area will help to achieve the planning goals mandated by the Growth Management Act under RCW 36.70A.020. The city council may, by ordinance, amend or rescind the designation of a residential target area at any time pursuant to the same procedure as set forth in this chapter for original designation.

The notice must state the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing and generally identify the area proposed to be designated.

(2) Target Area Standards and Guidelines. After designation of a residential target area, the city council shall adopt and implement standards and guidelines for both new construction and rehabilitation, including the application process and procedures and requirements that address demolition of existing structures and site utilization. The decision making process must include findings of compliance with RCW 84.14.060. The city council may also adopt guidelines which include parking, height, density, environmental impact, home ownership, public benefit features, compatibility with the surrounding property and such other amenities as will attract and keep permanent residents and will properly enhance the livability of the residential target area.

(b) Stimulate new construction of, or rehabilitation of existing vacant and underutilized buildings for, multifamily housing in residential target areas to increase and improve housing opportunities;

(c) Assist in directing future population growth to designated urban centers, thereby reducing development pressure on single-family residential neighborhoods; and

(d) Encourage new construction or rehabilitation of owner-occupied multifamily housing where identified as desirable.

(2) Duration of Exemption. The value of improvements qualifying under this chapter will be exempt from ad valorem property taxation for eight successive years where all applicable criteria under this chapter are met.

A minimum of four new units must be constructed or at least four additional multifamily units must be added to existing occupied multifamily housing.

The city council’s decision on appeal will be final.

(7) Extension of Conditional Certificate. The conditional certificate may be extended by the director for a period not to exceed 24 consecutive months. The applicant must submit a written request stating the grounds for the extension, accompanied by a $100.00 processing fee. An extension may be granted if the director determines that:

(b) Within 30 days of receipt of all materials required for a final certificate, the director shall determine which specific improvements satisfy the requirements, and whether the work completed is consistent with the application and the contract approved by the city and is qualified for a limited tax exemption under this chapter.

(9) Issuance of Final Certificate.

(a) Review and Approval. If, after reviewing the application for final certificate, the director determines that the project has been completed in accordance with the contract between the applicant and the city and has been completed within the authorized time period, the city shall, generally within 10 days, file a final certificate of tax exemption with the Clark County assessor.

(iii) The owner’s property is otherwise not qualified under this chapter.

(c) Appeal. Within 14 days of receipt of the director’s denial of a final certificate, the applicant may file an appeal with the city council. The appeal before the city council shall be based on the record. On appeal, the director’s decision will be upheld unless the applicant can show that there is no substantial evidence on the record to support the director’s decision. The city council’s decision on appeal will be final.

(b) A certification that the property continues to be in compliance with the contract with the city; and

(c) A description of any improvements or changes to the property constructed after the issuance of the certificate of tax exemption.

(d) The property owner must maintain records supporting this declaration and those records and the multifamily units are subject to inspection by the city. Failure to submit the annual declaration or maintain adequate records may result in the tax exemption being canceled.

(11) Annual Report. By December 31st of each year the city has any outstanding limited multifamily tax exemptions the city shall submit a report to the state providing the information required by Chapter 84.14 RCW.

(12) Cancellation of Tax Exemption. If the director determines the owner is not complying with the terms of the contract, the tax exemption will be canceled. This cancellation may occur in conjunction with the annual review or at any other time when noncompliance has been determined. If the owner intends to convert the multifamily housing to another use or otherwise discontinues compliance with this chapter, the owner must notify the director and the Clark County assessor within 60 days of the change in use.

(a) Effect of Cancellation. If a tax exemption is canceled due to a change in use or other noncompliance, the Clark County assessor may impose an additional tax on the property, together with the interest and penalty, and a priority lien may be placed on the land, pursuant to Chapter 84.14 RCW.

(b) Notice and Appeal. Upon determining that a tax exemption is to be canceled, the director shall notify the property owner by certified mail. The property owner may appeal the determination by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within 30 days, specifying the factual and legal basis for the appeal.

3.91.010 Schedule.

(1) The bimonthly water service charge for customers located within the service area of Washougal, according to classification established in this section, is as designated in subsection (10) of this section. The base charge is charged according to meter size as shown in Table 1 – Base Usage. Additional volume charges beyond the base usage are identified in Table 2 – Additional Volume Charges.

(2) As the water, sewer and stormwater department billings are handled through the same office and billed on a common bill, all services will be billed on a bimonthly basis as herein provided for water collection. The right to bill accounts on a monthly basis is reserved and may be implemented without further council action. If monthly billing is requested by the customer, the finance director shall be authorized to add an administrative fee to cover the costs of additional processing and any additional meter readings requested.

(3) Water and sewer service provided to buildings under construction will be billed to the property owner commencing with the period when a water meter is installed.

(4) In the event that water bills are not paid by the last day of the month following billing, the customers failing to pay shall be assessed a late charge of $10.00 or 10 percent of the past due amount, whichever is greater. If the last day of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, the next business day following shall be treated as the last day of the month.

(5) If more than one classification of service is maintained in the same or adjoining quarters in one structure, and use the same service pipe, then the base rate shall be the total of all classifications of service. Any excess usage over the composite minimum shall be charged based on the largest meter classification.

(6) For clarification purposes, each separate housekeeping establishment is considered as one unit and individual business establishment occupying individual quarters and under one structure is considered one unit.

(7) In calculating the domestic water consumption, deductions shall be made in units of 100 cubic feet and in making such deductions the two right-hand digits of the meter reading shall not be considered.

(8) Should any meter fail to register correctly, or if a leak should be detected, the city may adjust the billing accordingly.

It is the property owner’s responsibility to fix the leak and the city will adjust up to two billing cycles affected by the corrected leak.

(9) The city will keep an accurate account on its books of the reading of meters, and such account, so kept, shall be offered at all times, places and courts as prima facie evidence of the use of water service by the customer and shall be the basis on which all bills are calculated.

(10) Bimonthly Metered Rates.

3.91.065 Latecomer charges for sewer or water main or lateral line extension.

When a sewer or water main or lateral line is extended in accordance with the city’s water and sewer plans and such cost is absorbed entirely by the property owner who has requested the hookup to city utilities, then future assessment for hookup to that line shall be paid to the original property owner until such time as the verified cost of extending the line has been repaid, or a period of 10 years has lapsed, whichever shall first occur. After that, all latecomer charges will accrue to the city. It is specifically understood that only area assessment and front footage charges shall be used in paying latecomer charges to such property owner.

If a property owner(s) is required to construct off-site utilities that benefit adjacent owners, a special latecomer’s agreement can be granted by the city council. The request for consideration of a special latecomer’s fee is to be filed with the public works department. The request should include a proposed area of assessment. Following the public works department review, the request will be forwarded to the city council for consideration.

Further, the charges to the original property owner who installed the line, i.e., the area assessment and front footage charge, shall also be subtracted from the cost of the original line when computing the amount of latecomer charges due.

If termination of service does not occur on the above dates, we reserve the right to still do so at a later time if payment is still outstanding. Payment arrangements may be made at the discretion of the finance director or his designee; provided, that any arranged payments missed will result in immediate shut-off.

3.91.138 Sale of property.

When the sale of the real property occurs, it is the responsibility of the purchaser to contact the City Hall billing office and to make arrangements for water, sewer and refuse service. It is not the responsibility of the city to enforce payment of any billing which was against the property at the time of the sale against the seller. The billing and any liens against the property will remain against the property. The city will take no action to enforce payment of billings due at the sale date against the seller.

(4) Industrial Rates. To qualify to be an industrial customer, a customer must hold their own National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the Washington State Department of Ecology. The rates below are industrial sewer charges beyond simple domestic waste. The following data must submitted to the city by the fifteenth of the month for the preceding month’s analysis:

Average daily flow (gal)

Max daily flow (gal)

BOD (mg/L)

TSS (mg/L)

Industrial rate charges will be calculated as a ratio to the single-family residential rate as established in Table 3.92-1.

The volume of material accepted under the single-family household rate is as follows:

300 gallons per day

0.5 pounds of biological oxygen demand (BOD) per day

0.5 pounds of total suspended solids (TSS) per day

The equation used to calculate industrial equivalent single-family residential units (ERUs) is as follows:

	#ERUs =	0.54*(Industry Average Annual Flow/300 gpd) +

	 	0.20*(Industry Average Annual BOD Loading/0.5 lbs/day) +

	 	0.26*(Industry Average TSS Loading/0.5 lbs/day)

The calculation will be inputted and verified by city staff to calculate the customer’s monthly industrial sewer fee. 

(5) In the event that new construction, remodeling, annexations or change of classification not listed in the preceding sections arise, the sewer connection charges and nonservice charges shall be determined by the director of public works and approved by the city council. These charges shall be based on current rates and policies. In no case will the monthly service charge to any structure be less than $9.50.

There are other conditions of the wastewater treatment facility by Pendleton Woolen Mills, which are outlined and attached to Ordinance 1428 in Exhibit B, which is incorporated herein by this reference.

The average monthly flow will be established using the Pendleton Woolen Mills monthly Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR). Pendleton is to submit a copy of the DMR report at the same time it is submitted to the state.

(6) Date Range. If a date range for monthly service charge rates has expired, then the monthly service charge under this chapter shall remain at the latest established rate as shown in the rate table adopted under subsection (3) of this section, until such rate table is amended.

3.92.025 Adjustments to wastewater volume charge for commercial accounts.

It is the intent of this section to charge commercial customers for water that should enter the sewer system. Wastewater charges shall be based on the metered water delivered to the premises except as noted below: 

(1) Water metered exclusively for fire service, sprinkling, or irrigation shall not be subject to any wastewater charge or rate. 

(2) Where the use of water is such that a portion of all water used is lost by evaporation, irrigation, sprinkling or other cause, or is used in manufactured goods and commodities, customers may install, at their own expense, submeters approved by the director of public works to enable measurement of the amount of water so used or lost. These submeters must measure in CCF, must be calibrated on a regular basis, and must be easily accessible for meter reading. If the submeter is unable to be read or if the reading is unreliable, an estimate can be used, but the city of Washougal must get at least one accurate meter reading per year. Such estimate shall be approved by the director of public works. It will be the responsibility of the city of Washougal or its designee to inspect and approve the installation of a new submeter. 

(3) Should any meter fail to register correctly, or if a leak should be detected, the city may adjust the billing accordingly. The amount of the adjustment shall follow the same water leak process as described in WMC 3.91.010, unless otherwise approved by the director of public works. (Ord. 1854 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1785 § 4 (Exh. C), 2015)

(ix) That failure to pay the remaining balance at closing of any sale or transfer of the subject property shall be considered a delinquent payment of the remaining balance subject to lien and collection.

(x) That no permit for redevelopment (change of use) of the subject property shall be issued without payment in full of the remaining balance.

(xi) That in the event the property owner becomes delinquent, the owner agrees to pay any and all collection costs, including attorney fees and costs at trial and on appeal.

(1) When a sewer or water main or lateral line is extended in accordance with the city’s water and sewer plans and the cost is absorbed entirely by the property owner who has requested the hookup to city utilities, then future assessment for hookup to that line shall be paid to the original property owner until such time as the verified cost of extending the line has been repaid, or a period of 10 years has lapsed, whichever shall first occur. After that, all latecomer charges will accrue to the city.

(2) It is specifically understood that only front footage charges shall be used in paying latecomer charges to the property owner.

(3) Further, the charges to the original property owner who installed the line, i.e., the front footage charge, shall also be subtracted from the cost of the original line when computing the amount of latecomer charges due. (Ord. 1854 § 2 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1531 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1194 § 1 (Exh. A), 1996; Res. 280 § 1, 1992. Formerly 14.16.065)

The sewerage lien provided herein shall be effective for a period of one year of delinquent service charges without the necessity of any writing or recording of the lien with the county auditor, or for a longer period after the notice provided in RCW 35.67.210. Enforcement of the lien or liens shall be in the manner provided by law for enforcement of same. Upon full payment of the charges due, the finance director on behalf of the city executes and delivers to the property owner a release of such lien.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the erection, installation, maintenance and operation of all public utility poles, pole lines, circuits, or conductors erected or installed from and after 1953, except replacement of damaged poles made necessary for public safety, and all other such facilities heretofore installed and existing and in place as of 1953 shall be made to conform to such provisions not later than January 1, 1968; provided, however, that WMC 5.48.020(5) and (6) shall apply to the replacement and maintenance of all public utility poles.

Any conflict between the provisions of any franchise and any other present or future lawful exercise of the city’s police powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies exclusively to cable operator which contains provisions inconsistent with the franchise shall prevail only if upon such exercise, the city finds an emergency exists constituting a danger to health, safety, property or general welfare, or such exercise is mandated by law.

The franchise fees are in addition to all other fees, assessments, taxes or payments of general applicability that the grantee may be required to pay under any federal, state or local law. The franchise agreement and the franchise fees paid thereunder are not in lieu of any other generally applicable required permit, authorization, fee, charge or tax.

(2) Payments. A grantee’s franchise fee payments to the city shall be computed and paid annually unless a more frequent schedule is provided for by franchise agreement.

(3) Acceptance of Payment and Recomputation. No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord by the city that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall any acceptance of payments be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable or for the performance of any other obligation of a grantee.

(4) Franchise Fee Reports. A grantee shall furnish to the city annually or by such deadline as shall be set forth in the franchise agreement a statement stating the total amount of gross revenues and all payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payments. Such statement shall be reviewed by an independent certified public accountant prior to submission to the city.

(5) Annual Franchise Fee Reports. A grantee shall furnish to the city annually by such deadline as shall be set forth in the franchise agreement a statement stating the total amount of gross revenues and all payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payments. Such statement shall be reviewed by an independent certified public accountant prior to submission to the city.

(6) Audits. On an annual basis, upon 30 days’ prior written notice, city shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of a grantee’s records reasonably related to the administration or enforcement of a franchise agreement, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

If any such notice is given by the insurer, the city clerk shall advise the licensee that unless proper evidence is received, within 20 days, that adequate insurance has been obtained, a recommendation will be made to the city council for revocation of the certificate convenience and necessity. The recommendation shall be made at the next scheduled council meeting after the end of the 20-day period if proof of adequate insurance has not been filed. No provisions of this chapter shall be construed to limit the right of any injured person to any private right of action against a holder as herein defined. (Ord. 1109 § 6, 1993)


5.68.070 License fees.

No certificate shall be issued or continued in operation unless the holder thereof has paid an annual license fee of $35.00 for the right to engage in the taxicab business and $10.00 additional each year for each vehicle operated under a certificate of public convenience and necessity.

If the color scheme, identifying design or displayed name of a currently licensed taxicab or taxicabs is changed so as to be in conflict with or imitate that used by another person, owner or operator, if in the opinion of the city clerk such use could be misleading or tend to deceive the public, the license or certificate covering such taxicab or taxicabs shall be suspended or revoked.

(2) Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city clerk may appeal such decision to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal within 10 days of the date the city clerk renders his decision.

The taximeter shall be operated mechanically by a mechanism of standard design and construction. The case and all points and connections which, if manipulated, would affect its correct reading and recording are to be sealed. It shall be the duty of the driver to display a signal indicating that the vehicle is employed and the taximeter recording at the beginning of each trip and to move it to the nonrecording position at the end of each trip. It shall be the duty of the driver to call the attention of the passengers to the amount registered and the taximeter shall not be changed until after the fare is paid.

(2) Rates may be altered in the following manner:

Chapter 9.26 ELECTRONIC VAPOR DEVICES

Sections:

9.26.010    Purpose and intent.

9.26.020    Definitions.

9.26.030    Sampling and sales to minors prohibited.

9.26.040    Coupon redemption.

9.26.050    Possession by minors prohibited.

9.26.070    Mechanical sales restricted.

9.26.080    Use prohibited in public places and places of employment.

9.26.090    Penalties and enforcement.


9.26.010 Purpose and intent.

(1) It is expressly the purpose of this chapter to protect, provide for, and promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public. Its provisions shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes.

(2) The intent of this chapter is to protect minors from the hazards of nicotine addiction and the dangers of inhaling other products with no regulatory oversight as to their purity, content, and potential negative health impact. The intent of this chapter is to also protect the general public from exposure to vapors and gas fumes of liquid nicotine and/or other substances for which there is no regulatory oversight as to their purity, content, and potential negative health impact to the general public.

(3) The city of Washougal finds that the emergence of new, unregulated electronic smoking or vaping devices and unregulated nicotine delivery products present a threat to public health. Electronic smoking or vaping devices and other unapproved nicotine delivery products have a strong appeal to youth due to their high-tech design and availability in child-friendly flavors like chocolate and strawberry. Current state and federal law prohibits minors from legally purchasing, using or possessing tobacco in any form. FDA approved nicotine delivery devices or nicotine replacement therapy are not approved for persons younger than 18 years old.

(4) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that electronic vapor devices have not been fully studied, so consumers currently don’t know the potential risks of electronic vapor devices when used as intended, how much nicotine or other potentially harmful chemicals are being inhaled during use, or whether there are any benefits associated with using these products. The FDA has raised concerns that electronic vapor devices, which are often marketed in appealing flavors, can increase nicotine addiction among young people and may lead them to try conventional tobacco products. There is currently no regulation prohibiting the sale of electronic vapor devices to youth.

(5) The federal Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 banned candy and fruit-flavored cigarettes because the evidence demonstrated that flavored tobacco products are attractive to youth as they disguise the taste of tobacco. Young people believe that flavored tobacco products are less addictive and less harmful and those who smoke are far more likely to use flavored tobacco products than adults. Flavoring for electronic vapor devices is available in candy and fruit flavors, just as cigarettes were prior to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.

(6) The manufacturers of electronic vapor devices market their products as harmless and as a safe alternative to smoking. They also make claims that may impact a young person’s decision to use an electronic vapor device which can lead to nicotine dependence. Electronic vapor devices are currently available to youth to purchase since, unlike cigarettes, there are no restrictions on age.

(7) Electronic vapor devices may be used to inhale substances that are not regulated by the FDA, or state or federal law, which substances may be harmful to the user and others nearby. The Washington State Department of Health warns that secondhand vapor from electronic vapor devices may be unsafe. (Ord. 1773 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015)


9.26.020 Definitions.

The term includes e-pens, e-hookahs, hookah pens, vape-pipes, vape-pens, and such other devices, regardless of the details of the product appearance or marketed name, generally manufactured to resemble cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipes, hookahs, or other smoking devices, and which enables its user to inhale vapor or gas derived from liquid nicotine or other substances.

(2) A person may request a written waiver for this section from the code enforcement officer if the person can demonstrate to the code enforcement officer’s satisfaction that the premises is architecturally impracticable for the device to be located not less than 10 feet from all entrance and exit ways. Whether to grant a waiver is within the sole discretion of the code enforcement officer. (Ord. 1773 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015)


9.26.080 Use prohibited in public places and places of employment.

(1) The use of electronic vapor devices in public places and places of employment is prohibited. Owners, or in the case of a leased or rented space the lessee or other person in charge, shall prohibit the use of electronic vapor devices in public places and places of employment.

The city may cause said lien to be recorded against such property, but the lien shall be enforceable against the property without the need of being recorded.

The city shall be entitled to reimbursement of its attorney’s fees and costs incurred to enforce this chapter, including but not limited to the collection of assessments, whether or not an action is filed with a court.

(2) Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the chief of police, a city law enforcement officer, or a city code enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that a controlled substance event and/or nuisance activity has or is occurring in violation of this chapter, such city employees may seek permission to enter the property at all reasonable times to inspect the same. If permission to inspect is denied by the owner(s) and/or person(s) in charge of the property, or reasonable attempts to contact the owner(s) and/or person(s) in charge are unavailing, the chief of police and/or city attorney may apply to the court for an order authorizing entry upon the land for the performance of the inspection.

(3) All assessments under this chapter shall become final unless an appeal is filed within 20 days of service of the assessment. Any person against whom a monetary penalty is assessed under this chapter may seek appeal of the assessment by filing an action to appeal with the Washougal municipal court. All appeals shall be heard and decided by a Washougal municipal court judge. The method of appeal herein for all monetary assessment under this chapter shall be sole and exclusive. The decision of the Washougal municipal court judge shall be final.

(4) The appeal filing shall reference the assessment(s) being appealed, state the basis for the appeal, and shall be served upon the city attorney within three days of filing with the court. Within 15 days of filing the appeal with the court, a prehearing conference shall be set before a Washougal municipal judge to determine the timing of proceedings and other preliminary matters. All appeals shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 1-08 WAC, Uniform Procedural Rules; provided, however, that WAC 1-08-590 shall be excluded. Should any conflict arise between the provisions of this chapter and the applicable sections of Chapter 1-08 WAC, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. For purposes of this chapter, all references in the WAC to “agency” shall mean the Washougal municipal court judge.

(5) Filing an appeal shall stay the city from collecting on the appealed assessment until the appeal action has concluded, but shall not stay additional assessments from accruing due to continuing violations. This stay shall only apply to those persons who are named as appellants and who sign the appeal document. The assessment shall become final against all other nonparticipating persons against whom the assessment was made, should they fail to also timely appeal. The city may also proceed to collect assessments from all nonparticipating persons against whom it was assessed, regardless of the outcome of the appeal. Separate appeals based upon the same assessment or same chronic nuisance property shall be joined into one action. (Ord. 1777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015)


9.71.070 Burden of proof.

In all actions and appeals concerning enforcement of assessments, remedies, penalties, and licensing revocations under this chapter, the burden of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. Copies of police reports, reports of other city departments, agencies and employees, and reports of agents and contractors of the city documenting nuisance activities and/or controlled substance activities shall be admissible in all such actions and appeals. Additionally, evidence of a chronic nuisance property’s general reputation and the reputation of persons residing in or frequenting the chronic nuisance property shall be admissible in all such actions and appeals. (Ord. 1777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015)

They may also be ordered to pay relocation assistance not to exceed $3,300 to tenants who: (1) must relocate because of an order to cease renting or leasing; and (2) the court finds have not caused or participated in nuisance activities and/or controlled substance activities at the property. For the purpose of this section, the term “tenant” shall have the meaning set forth in RCW 59.18.030. (Ord. 1777 § 1 (Exh. A), 2015)


9.71.090 Suspension or revocation of business license.

In addition to any other remedy that is authorized by this chapter or other laws, upon the chief of police determining that a property is a chronic nuisance property pursuant to this chapter, and upon the failure to respond to the notice provided pursuant to WMC 9.71.030(1) or failure to enter into or comply with a written correction agreement, each owner and each person in charge shall be subject to the suspension or revocation of a business license or other license issued by the city and required at such property, including but not limited to licenses issued pursuant to WMC Title 5. This may be done on a case-by-case basis and at the sole discretion of the chief of police, by the chief forwarding a copy of the notice provided pursuant to WMC 9.71.030(1), requesting the finance director to suspend or revoke a business or other license issued by the city and relating to the chronic nuisance property, at which time the finance director may immediately pursue suspension or revocation of the said license(s) pursuant to the procedures set forth elsewhere in the Washougal Municipal Code.

10.26.010 Criteria.

The following criteria in this chapter shall be used for purposes of classifying streets within the city. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.020 Major arterials – Traffic service provided.

Major arterials provide for movement across and between large subparts of an urban region and serve predominantly “through” trips with minimum direct service to abutting land uses. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.030 Major arterials – Grouping of traffic generators.

Major arterial service is required by medium-to-large central business districts, most municipal airports, large shopping centers, large colleges and universities, large industrial plants, major governmental centers, large hospitals, important secondary business districts, major rail and seaport terminals and similar land uses which comprise the top layer of the hierarchy of trip generators. (Res. 130, 1972)




10.26.040 Major arterials – Spacing.

Major arterials will seldom be closer than one mile apart in even the most densely developed urban regions. In practice, it is expected that for most urban areas in Washington spacing of major arterials will be wider. Moreover, spacing will vary within any given urban area with major arterials being closest together in the vicinity of the central business district and becoming increasingly farther apart toward the suburban, rural boundary. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.050 Major arterials – Route continuity.

Major arterials shall form a closed, interconnected system linking together major traffic generators in urban areas. Stub end arterials are not normally classified as major arterials. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.060 Secondary arterials – Traffic service provided.

Secondary arterials provide for movement within the large subparts proscribed by major arterials. Secondary arterials may also serve “through traffic” but provide very much more direct service to abutting land uses than do major arterials. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.070 Secondary arterials – Grouping of traffic generators.

Secondary arterial service is required by small central business districts and traffic generators as listed above for major arterials except that such generators will be smaller, plus high schools and some grade schools, strip commercial development, parks, and low-use intensity recreational areas, warehousing areas, and similar land uses which comprise the middle layer of the trip generator hierarchy. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.080 Secondary arterials – Spacing.

Secondary arterial streets will seldom be closer than one-half mile from another secondary, or major, arterial street. In practice, it is expected that for most urban areas in the state of Washington the spacing of arterial streets will be wider. Moreover, spacing will vary within any given urban area with secondary arterials being closest together in the vicinity of the central business district and becoming increasingly farther apart toward the suburban, rural boundary. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.090 Secondary arterials – Route continuity.

Secondary arterials shall, wherever possible, be long, continuous streets with direct rather than meandering alignments. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.100 Collector arterials – Traffic service provided.

Collector arterials provide for movement within the smaller areas, which are often definable neighborhoods, and may be bounded by higher class arterials. Collector arterials serve very little “through” traffic, but serve a high proportion of local traffic requiring direct access to abutting land uses. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.110 Collector arterials – Grouping of traffic generators.

Collector arterial service is required for the majority of the nonresidential land uses which generate measurably important traffic volumes and which are not served by major or secondary arterials. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.120 Collector arterials – Spacing.

Collector arterials will seldom be closer than one-fourth mile from any other arterial street. In practice, it is expected that for most urban areas in the state the spacing of arterial streets will be wider. Moreover, spacing will vary within any given urban area with collector arterials being closest together in the vicinity of the central business district and becoming increasingly farther apart toward the suburban, rural boundary. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.130 Collector arterials – Route continuity.

Collector arterials need not be particularly long or continuous since this would tend to attract through trips in unduly high proportions. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.140 Secondary arterials – Designated.

Based on the above criteria and the city engineer’s recommendation the following streets shall be classified as secondary arterials:

“B” Street from 15th Street to 32nd Street;

27th Street from “B” Street to Index Street;

Index Street from 27th to the Bonneville Power Storage Facilities. (Res. 130, 1972)


10.26.150 Collector arterials – Designated.

“C” Street from 6th to the west city limits shall be classified as a collector arterial. (Res. 130, 1972)


Chapter 10.28 TRUCK ROUTES

Sections:

10.28.010    Established.

10.28.025    Fifteenth Street.

10.28.030    Vehicle width limitation.


10.28.010 Established.

There are established certain routes over and along the public streets and highways of the city which are to be known as truck routes. These routes are established by the supervisor of public works with the approval of the city council and are to be posted by appropriate signs. (Ord. 357 § 7, 1967)


10.28.025 Fifteenth Street.

A truck route shall be designated on Fifteenth Street from Highway 14 north to “E” Street; then east on “E” Street to 32nd; then south on 32nd to the Industrial Park. (Ord. 806 § 2, 1982)


10.28.030 Vehicle width limitation.

No vehicles in excess of 14 feet in width shall use the streets of Washougal except by special permit from the policing authority of the city whereby vehicles may be granted special permission to use the truck route as established by Washougal ordinance. (Ord. 470 § 1, 1972)

10.35.010 Findings.

The city council finds that:

(1) RCW 70.94.521 et seq. requires that each county containing an urban growth area, designated pursuant to RCW 36.70A.110, and each city within an urban growth area with a state highway segment exceeding the 100 person hours of delay threshold calculated by the Department of Transportation, as well as those counties and cities located in any contiguous urban growth areas, shall adopt a commute trip reduction plan and ordinance for major employers in the affected urban growth area;

(2) Counties, cities, and the regional transportation council are required to develop regionally coordinated commute trip reduction plans with an initial emphasis on requiring major employers within affected cities and counties to develop programs intended to accomplish commute trip reduction by employees;

(3) A regional CTR ordinance and CTR plans have been developed for the cities of Vancouver, Camas and Washougal, as well as Clark County, and CTR plans for WSDOT, the regional transportation council and C-TRAN;

(4) Adoption and implementation of this plan will lead to a reduction in single-occupancy vehicle use which will assist in improving air quality, relieving traffic congestion and reducing consumption of fossil fuels while enhancing the region’s economic vitality by maintaining and improving accessibility and mobility, and which will balance financial, social and environmental considerations;

(5) The city council recognizes the importance of increasing individual citizens’ awareness of air quality, energy consumption, and traffic congestion and the contribution individual actions can make toward addressing these issues;

(6) Certain large employers, such as schools, are not affected by this chapter. However, recognizing the benefits that commute trip reduction planning offers to the overall community, the city council encourages these employers to voluntarily participate in this program. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

“Affected employee” means a full-time employee who begins his or her regular workday at a single worksite covered by the commute trip reduction plan between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. (inclusive) on two or more weekdays for at least 12 continuous months who is not an independent contractor. Seasonal agricultural employees, including seasonal employees of processors of agricultural products, are excluded from the count of affected employees.

“Affected employer” means an employer that employs 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite covered by the commute trip reduction plan who are scheduled to begin their regular work day between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. (inclusive) on two or more weekdays for at least 12 continuous months. Construction worksites, when the expected duration of the construction is less than two years, are excluded from this definition. (Also see definition of “Employer.”)

“Alternative mode” means any means of commute transportation other than in which the single-occupant vehicle is the dominant mode, including telecommuting and compressed work week schedules if they result in reducing commute trips.

“Alternative work schedules” means programs such as compressed work schedules that eliminate work trips for affected employees.

“Base year” means the 12-month period which commences when a major employer is determined by the jurisdiction to be participating within the CTR program. The city uses this 12-month period as the basis upon which it develops commute trip reduction goals.

“Base year survey” or “baseline measurement” means the survey, during the base year, of employees at a major employer worksite to determine the drive-alone rate and vehicle miles traveled per employee at the worksite. The jurisdiction uses this measurement to develop commute trip reduction goals for the major employer. The baseline measurement must be implemented in a manner that meets the requirements specified by the city.

“Carpool” means a motor vehicle, including a motorcycle, occupied by two to six people of at least 16 years of age traveling together for their commute trip, resulting in the reduction of a minimum of one motor vehicle commute trip.

“Commute trip” means a trip made from a worker’s home to a worksite (inclusive) on weekdays.

“Commute trip reduction (CTR) plan” means the city of Washougal’s plan which is designed to achieve reductions in the proportion of single-occupant vehicle commute trips and the commute trip vehicle miles traveled per affected employees of affected public and private sector employers within the city of Washougal.

“Commute trip vehicle miles traveled per employee” means the sum of the individual vehicle commute trip lengths in miles over a set period divided by the number of full-time employees during that period.

“Compressed work week” means an alternative work schedule, in accordance with employer policy, that regularly allows a full-time employee to eliminate at least one work day every two weeks by working longer hours during the remaining days, resulting in fewer commute trips by the employee. This definition is primarily intended to include weekly and bi-weekly arrangements, the most typical being four 10-hour days or 80 hours in nine days, but may also include other arrangements.

“CTR” is the abbreviation of commute trip reduction.

“CTR program” means an employer’s strategies to reduce employees’ drive-alone commutes and average VMT per employee.

“Custom bus/buspool” means a commuter bus service arranged specifically to transport employees to work.

“Director” means director of public works.

“Employee transportation coordinator (ETC)” means a person who is designated as responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of an employer’s CTR program.

“Employer” means a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, unincorporated association, cooperative, joint venture, agency, department, district or other individual or entity, whether public, nonprofit or private, that employs workers.

“Exemption” means a waiver from any or all CTR program requirements granted to an employer by the city based on unique conditions that apply to the employer or employment site.

“Flex-time” is an employer policy that provides work schedules allowing individual employees flexibility in choosing the start and end times but not the number of their working hours.

“Full-time employee” means a person, other than an independent contractor, whose position is scheduled on a continuous basis for 52 weeks for an average of at least 35 hours per week.

“Good-faith effort” means that an employer has met the minimum requirements identified in RCW 70.94.531 and this chapter, and is working collaboratively with the city to continue its existing CTR program or is developing and implementing program modifications likely to result in improvements to its CTR program over an agreed-upon length of time.

“Implementation” means active pursuit by an employer of the CTR goals of RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.555 and this chapter as evidenced by appointment of an employee transportation coordinator (ETC), distribution of information to employees regarding alternatives to drive-alone commuting, and commencement of other measures according to its approved CTR program and schedule.

“Major employer” means a private or public employer, including state agencies, that employs 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite who are scheduled to begin their regular work day between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on weekdays for at least 12 continuous months.

“Major employer worksite,” “affected worksite” or “worksite” means the physical location occupied by a major employer, as determined by the local jurisdiction.

(1) Setting CTR Goals. The city’s goals for reductions in the proportions of drive-alone commute trips and vehicle miles traveled per employee by affected employers in the city’s jurisdiction, major employment installations, and other areas designated by the city are hereby established by the city’s CTR plan incorporated by WMC 10.35.040. These goals establish the desired level of performance for the CTR program in its entirety in the city. The city will set the individual worksite goals for affected employers based on how the worksite can contribute to the city’s overall goal established in the CTR plan. The goals will appear as a component of the affected employer’s approved implementation plan outlined in WMC 10.35.070.

(2) Commute Trip Reduction Goals for Affected Employers.

(a) The drive-alone and VMT goals for affected employers in the city are hereby established as set forth in the CTR plan incorporated by WMC 10.35.040.

(b) If the goals for an affected employer or newly affected employer are not listed in the CTR plan, they shall be established by the city at a level designed to achieve the city’s overall goals for the jurisdiction and other areas as designated by the city. The city shall provide written notification of the goals for each affected employer worksite by providing the information when the city reviews the employer’s proposed program and incorporating the goals into the program approval issued by the city. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.060 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any affected employer within the geographic limits of the CTR plan adopted in WMC 10.35.040. This chapter only applies when the CTR plan, as approved in WMC 10.35.040, designates the employer as affected based on location within the geographic limits of the plan.

(1) Notice of Applicability.

(a) Publication of Notice. In addition to the city’s established public notification for adoption of an ordinance, a notice of availability of a summary of this chapter, a notice of the requirements and criteria for affected employers to comply with this chapter, and subsequent revisions shall be published at least once in the city’s official newspaper not more than 30 days after passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter or revisions.

(b) Notice to Known Affected Employers. Affected employers located in the city are to receive written notification that they are subject to this chapter. Such notice shall be addressed to the company’s chief executive officer, senior official, CTR program manager, or registered agent at the worksite. Such notification shall provide 90 days for the affected employer to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city.

(c) Self-Identification. Affected employers that, for whatever reason, do not receive notice within 30 days of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter and are either notified or identify themselves to the city within 90 days of the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter will be granted an extension to assure up to 90 days within which to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city. Upon self-identification, such affected employers will be granted 180 calendar days to develop and submit a CTR program.

(d) Failure to Identify. Affected employers that have not been identified or do not identify themselves within 90 days of the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter and do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city within 90 days from the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

(e) Potential Affected Employer. Any existing or new employer (of 75 or more persons) that obtains a city business license subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, shall be required to complete a questionnaire that assesses whether or not an employer will be deemed affected or nonaffected in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(f) Baseline Measurement. If an affected employer has already performed a baseline measurement, or an alternative acceptable to the city under previous iterations of this chapter, the employer is not required to perform another baseline measurement.

(2) Newly Affected Employers.

(a) Definition of Newly Affected Employer. Employers meeting the definition of “affected employer” in this chapter must identify themselves to the city within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries outlined in the CTR plan or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees. Employers who do not identify themselves within 90 days are in violation of this chapter.

(b) Baseline Survey. Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city. Employers who do not perform a baseline measurement within 90 days of receiving written notification that they are subject to this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

(c) CTR Program Submittal. Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to the city. The program will be developed in consultation with the city to be consistent with the goals of the CTR plan adopted in WMC 10.35.040. The program shall be implemented not more than 90 days after approval by the city. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties outlined in WMC 10.35.110.

(3) Change in Status as an Affected Employer. Any changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements.

(a) Nonaffected Employer. If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is no longer an affected employer for the purposes of this chapter. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the city that it is no longer an affected employer. The employer bears the burden of proof to establish this.

(b) Change in status within 12-month period. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.

(c) Change in status in a greater than 12-month period. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an unaffected employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.070 Requirements for affected employers.

An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and drive-alone commute trips.

(1) CTR Program – Mandatory Elements. Each employer’s CTR program shall include the following mandatory elements:

(a) Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC). The affected employer shall designate an employee transportation coordinator (ETC) to administer the CTR program. The ETC and/or designee’s name, location and telephone number must be displayed prominently at each affected worksite. The ETC shall oversee all elements of the employer’s CTR program and act as liaison between the employer and the city. The objective is to have an effective transportation coordinator present at each worksite; an affected employer with multiple worksites may have one designated ETC for all sites. ETCs will be responsible for attending all CTR-sponsored trainings and meetings.

(b) Information Distribution. Information about alternatives to drive-alone commuting as well as a summary of the employer’s CTR program shall be provided to employees at least twice a year and to new employees at the time of hire. Each CTR program description and subsequent annual reports must describe the information to be distributed and the method(s) of distribution.

(c) Emergency Ride Home (ERH) Program. The affected employer shall offer an emergency ride home program to employees. If an ERH program is available through the regional CTR program administrator, then the employer may choose to use this for its program. The ERH program offered by the regional CTR program administrator will allow employees to use three emergency ride home vouchers in one calendar year period or one year within their start-of-work date if the employee has worked for the employer for less than one year. An employer may choose to allow more emergency rides home if the employer chooses to pay for them.

(2) Additional Program Elements. In addition to the specific CTR program elements previously described in this section, to meet the CTR goals as identified in the city’s CTR plan, employers will be required to have at least two additional program elements as part of their CTR program. Elements may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a) Provision of preferential parking for carpools and vanpools;

(b) Reduced parking charges for carpool and vanpool vehicles;

(c) Provision of commuter ride-matching services to facilitate employee ride-sharing for commute trips;

(d) Provision of subsidies for rail, transit, or vanpool fares and/or transit passes;

(e) Provision of vans or buses for employee ridesharing;

(f) Provision of subsidies for carpools, walking, bicycling, teleworking, or compressed schedules;

(g) Provision of incentives for employees that do not drive alone to work;

(h) Permitting the use of the employers’ vehicles for carpooling or vanpooling;

(i) Permitting flexible work schedules to facilitate employees’ use of transit, carpools or vanpools;

(j) Construction of special bus stops for transit users;

(k) Provision of bicycle parking facilities such as bicycle lockers or secure areas inside a building or a covered outside area that requires some type of key access or ability to lock bicycles;

(l) Provision of changing areas and showers for employees who bicycle or walk to work;

(m) Provision of parking incentives program such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities;

(n) Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes which reduces commute trips;

(o) Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules such as a compressed work week, which reduces commute trips;

(p) Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities or food establishments;

(q) Charging employees for parking and/or the elimination of free parking; and

(r) Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site as approved by the regional CTR program administrator.

(3) CTR Program Report and Description. Affected employers shall review their program and file a regular progress report with the city in accordance with the format provided by the city every two years. If necessary, the regional CTR program administrator may require a regular progress report be submitted every year. The CTR program report and description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for the reporting period. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements. At a minimum, the employer’s CTR program report and description must include:

(a) A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;

(b) The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;

(c) Documentation on compliance with the mandatory CTR program elements as described in subsection (1) of this section;

(d) Description of any additional elements included in the employer’s CTR program as described in subsection (2) of this section; and

(e) A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer’s established goals.

(4) Biennial Measure of Employee Commute Behavior. In addition to the baseline measurement, employers shall conduct a program evaluation as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect commute trip reduction program employee questionnaires (“surveys”) at least once every two years and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.080 Record keeping.

Affected employers shall maintain a copy of their approved CTR program description and report, their CTR program employee questionnaire results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to the city for a minimum of 48 months. The city and the employer shall agree on the record keeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.090 Schedule and process for CTR program description and report.

(1) Document Review. The city shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or annual report within 90 days of submission, the employer’s program or annual report is deemed accepted. The city may extend the review period up to 90 days.

The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

(2) Schedule. Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, the city shall establish the employer’s regular reporting date. This report will be provided in a form provided by the city consistent with WMC 10.35.070(3).

(3) Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the city for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exists:

(a) Impossibility. The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the affected employer; or

(b) Undue Hardship. The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.

The city may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request.

(4) Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description and report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The city shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s annual reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the city.

(5) Implementation of Employer’s CTR Program. Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from the city that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from the city. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.100 Enforcement.

(1) Compliance. For purposes of this section, “compliance” shall mean:

(a) Fully implementing in good faith all mandatory program elements as well as provisions in the approved CTR program description and report;

(b) Providing a complete CTR program description and report on the regular reporting date; and

(c) Distributing and collecting the CTR program employee questionnaire (“survey”) during the scheduled survey time period.

(2) Program Modification Criteria. The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:

In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program and description, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program.

(B) The city shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program.

(C) If a revised program is not acceptable, the city will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program.

(D) A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the city within 10 working days of the conference.

(3) Violations. The following shall each constitute a violation of this chapter if the established deadlines are not met:

(a) Failure to develop and/or submit on time a complete CTR program.

(b) Failure to implement all elements of an approved CTR program, unless the program elements that are carried out can be shown through quantifiable evidence to meet or exceed VMT and drive-alone goals as specified in this chapter.

(c) Failure to revise a CTR program as defined in RCW 70.94.534(4) and this chapter.

(d) Failure to self-identify as an affected employer.

(3) Civil Penalties. An employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. An employer of unionized or otherwise represented employees shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if it:

(a) Proposes to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and

(b) Advises the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the city and advises the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with state law (RCW 70.94.531). (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.120 Exemptions and goal modifications.

(1) Grounds for Exemption. An affected employer may request the city to grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The affected employer shall demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if, and only if, the employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of drive-alone trips and VMT per employee.

(a) Timing. Exemptions may be granted by the city at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request.

(b) Annual Review. The city shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

(c) Other Exemptions.

(i) Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a worksite’s CTR program.

(ii) Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts.

(iii) The city will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests.

(iv) The city shall review annually all employee exemption requests and shall determine whether an exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

(2) Modification of CTR Program Goals. An affected employer may request that the city modify its program goals. Such requests shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description and annual report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program. The city will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after the city approval of its initial program description or annual report. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.130 Hearing examiner.

(1) One or more hearing examiners shall be appointed by the city to hear appeals relating to the interpretation and/or enforcement of this chapter.

(a) Notice of civil violation; and

(b) Administrative decisions regarding exemptions, modification of goals and CTR program elements.

(3) Conduct of Appeal Hearing. The hearing officer shall hear evidence presented by the city. The hearing examiner shall likewise hear evidence presented by the person appealing the notice of violation or administrative decision. In the case of an appeal of a notice of civil violation, the burden of proof at the hearing shall rest with the city to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a violation as claimed. In the case of an appeal of an administrative interpretation, the hearing officer shall give substantial weight to the director’s interpretation and shall substitute his judgment only upon a showing by the appellant that the director’s interpretation is arbitrary and capricious. Formal rules of evidence need not be followed, but witnesses shall be sworn by the hearing officer and a written order issued. (Ord. 1666 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


10.35.140 Appeal procedure.

(1) Appeal Requirements. All appeals to the hearing officer as provided for in this chapter shall be filed in writing with the director or other such agency as the city may designate.

(f) The failure of any person to file a timely appeal, or failure of any person who has filed an appeal to attend a scheduled hearing, shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an appeal hearing.

(g) Filing of an appeal shall stay the enforcement of any notice of civil violation or other action during the pendency of such appeal except as otherwise provided.

(h) A copy of the final order of the hearing officer shall be mailed to the appealing party within three weekdays following the entry of a written order under this section. Unless otherwise stated in the order, this order shall be final and conclusive 10 days from the date of mailing thereof, unless any party of record makes application to a court of competent jurisdiction for judicial review and stay of enforcement.

10.46.060 Alternative penalty for minor children.

In lieu of the penalty described above, any Washougal police officer may, in their discretion, utilize the following penalty provision for violations by minor children. For purposes of this section, the city council of the city of Washougal hereby finds that there is a compelling governmental interest in opposing the following discretionary penalty section for minor children, in order to encourage parental intervention and responsibility for the violations of the minor children. The city finds that impoundment is more likely to prevent repeated offenses by minors in the imposition of monetary penalties.

(1) First Offense. On the child’s first offense in a 365-day period, the city shall issue a written warning and notification of the child’s parent or guardian of the violation.

(2) Second Offense. On the child’s second offense in a 365-day period, the city shall issue a written notice of violation and the investigating officer may take custody of the motorized foot scooter and hold for safe-keeping until the child’s parent or guardian claims the motorized foot scooter.

(3) Third and Subsequent Offenses. On the child’s third offense in a 365-day period, the city shall include a civil fine, not to exceed $250.00. The arresting officer may take custody of the motorized foot scooter and may hold for safe-keeping for a period of 30 days.

As authorized by WAC 308-330-565 and Chapter 63.32 RCW, impounded motorized foot scooters may be forfeited to the Washougal police department if unclaimed within 60 days of the impound. (Ord. 1489 § 1, 2004)

It is in the public interest to promote the conservation of the city’s water supply in order to protect the health, welfare and safety of water users. To accomplish this declared purpose, the city reserves the right to exercise its police powers through emergency measures as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1920 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 1551 § 1, 2006)


13.14.020 Authority.

The public works director, when necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, shall have the authority to declare various stages of water emergencies and to implement the water conservation measures set forth in this chapter. The public works director shall also have authority to determine whether the various stages of water emergencies and water conservation measures apply to the entire city utility service area or to such portions as may be particularly affected. The director shall at all times be subject to the direction and authority of the city manager. (Ord. 1920 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 1551 § 1, 2006)


13.14.030 Policies and procedures.

The following policies and procedures shall apply during the various stages of water emergencies as set forth in this section:

(1) Stage I – Anticipated Water Shortage – Internal Preparations. The public works director may declare a Stage I water emergency when a water shortage is anticipated but not immediate. The public works department shall conduct public education efforts regarding the benefits and necessity of conservation by the public.

(2) Stage II – Serious Water Shortage – Voluntary Conservation. The public works director may declare a Stage II water emergency when a water shortage exists such that immediate voluntary reductions in consumption are necessary. The public works department shall conduct an intensified public information campaign and shall institute a voluntary odd/even home irrigation program. The city shall reduce usage for designated park irrigation systems that do not affect sports fields.

(3) Stage III – Critical Water Shortage – Limited Outdoor Restrictions. The public works director may declare a Stage III water emergency when a water shortage exists such that water supplies are critically impacted and water demand must be reduced. The public works director is authorized to establish certain specified days or hours for irrigating, sprinkling or watering lawns and gardens, and may prohibit or regulate other nonessential uses of water within the water system during such times as there is an actual or impending water shortage, extreme pressure loss in the distribution system, or for any other reasonable cause. The following nonessential uses of water may be prohibited on all properties connected to the city’s water system, whether inside or outside of the city:

(a) Washing sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, patios, and other exterior paved areas by direct hosing, except as may be necessary to prevent or eliminate materials dangerous to the public health and safety;

(b) Escape of water through breaks or leaks within the customer’s plumbing or private distribution system for any period of time beyond which such break or leak should reasonably have been discovered and corrected. It shall be presumed that a period of 48 hours after the customer discovers a leak or break, or receives notice from the city of such leak or break, whichever occurs first, is a reasonable time in which to correct the same;

(c) Noncommercial washing of privately owned motor vehicles, trailers, and boats, except from a bucket or hose using a shutoff nozzle for quick rinses;

(d) Lawn sprinkling and irrigation which allows water to run off or overspray the lawn area. Every customer is deemed to have knowledge of and control over his or her lawn sprinkling and irrigation at all times;

(e) Sprinkling and irrigation of lawns, ground cover, or other plants, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. or on any day not authorized by the established rotation schedule;

(f) Such other uses as the public works director deems appropriate.

(4) Stage IV – Emergency Water Shortage – Mandatory Outdoor Restrictions and Indoor Conservation. The public works director may declare a Stage IV water emergency when a water shortage exists such that maximum flow reduction is immediately required, water available to the city is insufficient to permit any irrigation, watering or sprinkling, and all available water is needed solely for human consumption, sanitation and fire protection. The public works director may prohibit all nonessential uses of water, including, but not limited to, all vehicle washing, all lawn watering, and all of the uses that may be prohibited for a Stage III water emergency. The public works and utilities department shall disseminate information using every available means to encourage customers to reduce indoor water usage to the maximum extent possible.

(5) Stage V – Regional Disaster – Water Rationing. The public works director may declare a Stage V regional disaster water emergency when a water shortage exists such that water rationing must be implemented and emergency water distribution may be necessary for customers without water. The public works director is authorized to restrict water use by rationing the amount of water used by residential users to a certain number of gallons per day per person residing within the dwelling unit, by rationing the amount of water used by nonresidential users based on a percentage of their historical usage as calculated by the city, and by any other type of rationing as the public works director deems necessary and appropriate in the circumstances.

(6) Implementation Requirements. Prior to the implementation and enforcement of any of the above stages, the public works director shall take reasonable efforts to have information disseminated to affected customers regarding the rationing plan, which shall include, at a minimum, publication in the official newspaper of the city at least once, not less than one week in advance of the effective date of the declaration, information of the declaration of the applicable stage, a description of the limitations and restrictions that would apply, and identification of the effective date of the declared stage and limitations and restrictions. Notwithstanding the publication requirements set forth in this chapter, if it is determined by the public works director that exigent circumstances exist that necessitate immediate implementation and enforcement of any particular stages of water emergency, notice to affected customers may be provided by personal service of the notice on such customers, or by posting notices at the customers’ residences (if the customers’ residences are the affected sites), or by posting notices at the locations where the customers’ utility services are received (if the affected sites are not their residences).

(7) Term of Stage and Scope. The public works director is also authorized to determine the geographic area to which the declared stage shall apply, and to determine the duration for which the declared stage and its limitations and restrictions shall be in effect. (Ord. 1920 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 1551 § 1, 2006)


13.14.040 Enforcement.

13.14.050 Variances.

The public works director may grant temporary variances for the prospective use of water otherwise prohibited by this chapter. Such temporary variances shall be in writing and shall be based on a determination by the director that, due to unusual circumstances, application of this chapter would cause an extraordinary hardship adversely affecting the health, sanitation, or fire protection of the applicant or the public. The director’s determination shall be final unless appealed as follows: a party adversely affected by the director’s determination may appeal the determination to the city manager or designee within 24 hours of the director’s determination or such later time as the city manager may designate. The city manager’s determination shall be final and nonappealable. The 24-hour periods shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. (Ord. 1920 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 1551 § 1, 2006)

(2) The amount of the water or sewer additional connection charge and the area or properties which will be required to pay the same shall be established by resolution or ordinance of the city council and the amount shall be determined generally by dividing the total costs of the project within the public right-of-way or easement by the estimated maximum number of benefited. In determining the amount of the charges, the city council shall consider the costs which have been incurred to design, engineer, construct and install the water or sewer main extension.

(3) The additional connection charge will include an interest charge equal to the greater of six percent or 75 percent of the prime rate of Bank of America (as then in effect) from the completion of the improvement until the time of connection.

Such joint service may, however, be continued at the option of the director providing one owner is responsible and agrees to pay the total water bill for two or more premises. Computation of the total bill for flat rate services shall be made by adding the total of the separate use classifications of the premises. Computation of the total bill for meter services shall be based on multiplying the quantity in each bracket of the rate schedule by the number of consumers on one meter.

Chapter 14.12 CONNECTIONS

Sections:

14.12.005    Purpose.

14.12.010    Public sanitary sewer required inside UGA.

14.12.020    Conformance to Uniform Plumbing Code required.

14.12.030    Made by city – Costs – Lien.

14.12.040    Authorized personnel required.

14.12.050    Out-of-town service.


14.12.005 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to further the public health by providing clear rules for when connection to public sewer is required and when it is prohibited. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit violation of regulations for on-site sewage disposal systems promulgated by the State of Washington Department of Public Health or the Clark County Health District. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003)


14.12.010 Public sanitary sewer required inside UGA.

(1) Building Permit Issuance. Inside UGAs, connection to public sewer is required as a condition of building permit issuance for any new structure unless the responsible official, utilizing a Type I review process, finds that one of the following exceptions applies:

(a) The new structure is an alteration, expansion or replacement of an existing structure which will not entail a material increase in sewage effluent production.

(b) The new structure lawfully incorporates an approved on-site sewage system.

(c) The new structure is for single-family residential use, or a nonresidential use generating a projected effluent flow of not more than 700 gallons per day if:

(i) Such use does not generate hazardous/dangerous waste, as defined by applicable federal, state or local law; and

(ii) Extension of public sewer is impractical based upon the following criteria:

(A) Public sewer would have to be extended more than 300 feet to the nearest property lines; or

(B) Necessary permission cannot be obtained from intervening landowner(s); or

(C) Intervening property contains natural or manmade obstructions such as deep canyons, elevation changes and solid rock impediments, which make public sewer extension prohibitive and undesirable; and

(iii) A covenant to the city and sewer purveyor is recorded which commits the current and future property owner(s) to connect to public sewer within 12 months of sewer becoming available (“available” means within 300 feet). The covenant shall also contain a provision that commits the current and future property owner(s) to participate in a future local improvement district if this is the method used to extend sewer. Where the sewer purveyor is a city, such covenant additionally shall bind the current or future owner to support annexation to such municipality.

(2) Land Divisions within UGA. Inside UGAs connection to public sewers is required as a condition of approval of new land divisions, whether by plat, short plat or site plan application, except that this prohibition shall not apply to a two-lot land division where one of the lots is, or will be, developed in a use that generates no sewage effluent. Any plat approved under this exception shall record a covenant prohibiting the installation of plumbing fixtures for any use on the designated lot.

(3) Period of Validity. A Type I decision under this chapter shall be valid for a period of one year if not associated with any other action. When such a decision is made in conjunction with another application (e.g., short plat, plat or site plan), the decision shall be valid for the same period as the decision on the related application.

It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to provide, at their expense, service laterals where none have been provided. Laterals shall be designed, approved, installed and inspected to city standards and specifications. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1140 § 1, 1994; Ord. 1098 § 1 (Exh. A), 1993; Ord. 349 Art. 3 § 1, 1967)


14.12.020 Conformance to Uniform Plumbing Code required.

All connections shall be made to sanitary sewers in a permanent and sanitary manner in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Uniform Plumbing Code as amended, subject to the approval of the director. No storm or surface water shall be discharged into any sanitary sewer. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1140 § 1, 1994; Ord. 1098 § 1 (Exh. A), 1993; Ord. 349 Art. 3 § 2, 1967)


14.12.030 Made by city – Costs – Lien.

If any such connections shall not be made within the time or in the manner herein provided, the director or other employee of the city, as the council may hereafter designate, is authorized and directed to cause any such connection to be made and to file a statement of the cost thereof with the city clerk, which costs shall in no event be less than the sewer connection charge hereinafter affixed for the class of buildings applicable to the building to which the connection is made, and thereupon a warrant shall be issued under the direction of the city council by the clerk and against the sewer revenue fund for the payment of such costs. The amount of such warrant together with a penalty of 10 percent plus interest at the rate of six percent per year upon the total amount of such warrant and penalty shall be assessed against the property upon which the building or structure is situated and shall become a lien thereon as herein provided.

Such total amount when collected shall be paid into the revenue fund. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1140 § 1, 1994; Ord. 1098 § 1 (Exh. A), 1993; Ord. 349 Art. 3 § 3, 1967)


14.12.040 Authorized personnel required.

No connection to any sewer line or lateral or other part of the sanitary sewerage system of the city shall be made by any person or persons, firm, association, or corporation except those regularly licensed to perform that class of work, or those approved by the supervisor of public works, and such connections shall then only be made on the condition that the person or persons, firm, association, or corporation making such connections will indemnify and hold harmless the city from all suits, claims, accidents, and damages occasioned by opening the streets, alleys or public places for the purpose of such connection, and will replace and restore such streets, alleys or public places over such opening to the satisfaction and approval of the supervisor of public works. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1098 § 1 (Exh. A), 1993; Ord. 349 Art. 4 § 1, 1967)


14.12.050 Out-of-town service.

The city will not provide city water and/or sanitary sewer service for any person and/or entity developing property and/or residing outside the city limits of the city, unless the person and/or entity shall agree to annex their respective property to the city as soon as such annexation is available. Each person and/or entity shall enter into a contractual agreement binding the person and/or entity to annexation of the unincorporated property when annexation is available. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1098 § 1 (Exh. A), 1993; Ord. 295, 1982; Res. 291, 1982)

14.14.020 Cleanout required.

(1) Private service lines shall be connected to the sewer stub at the property line by means of a properly installed and adequately witnessed cleanout, meeting current APWA specifications and complying with the International Building Code.

(2) If the customer, at any time, is required to uncover the connection of the building sewer to the sewer stub in order to correct or remove a blockage, this junction shall not be covered until an appropriate and correct cleanout has been properly installed, inspected and witnessed. This will usually not be done by city personnel unless an emergency or problem of public health exists. (Ord. 1612 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 849 § 1, 1985)


14.14.030 Blockage – Responsibility for clearing.

(1) When Cleanout Exists. When such a correctly installed and locatable cleanout exists, the city field personnel will respond to requests for assistance in the correction of sewer blockages. This assistance will be limited to verifying that the stub is clear from the street main to the cleanout.

(a) If the blockage exists at the cleanout, indicating improper original installation, or between the cleanout and the building, then the correction of the blockage shall be the sole responsibility of the customer.

(b) If the blockage exists between the cleanout and the street main, the city personnel shall correct the blockage and restore free flow at no expense to the customer. To assure continued free flow of the sewer stub, the city personnel shall be permitted on the customer’s property, from time to time, for the purpose of performing any necessary or periodic maintenance.

(2) When No Cleanout Exists. In the case of blockages where no cleanout exists at the junction of the lateral stub and house sewer, the city’s responsibility shall be limited to assuring that the street main is flowing free. (Ord. 849 § 1, 1985)

Article I. General Provisions


14.24.010 Purpose and policy.

(1) This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) operated by the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this chapter are:

(a) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW;

(b) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;

(c) To ensure that the quality of POTW sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations;

(d) To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;

(e) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge (biosolids) from the POTW; and

(f) To promote strategies which reduce the amounts of pollutants by users, thereby reducing the associated hazards to the POTW and receiving waters.

(2) This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. This chapter defines certain prohibited discharges; sets forth local limits, as defined in WMC 14.24.080, for use by state agencies in the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the recovery of liquidated damages and collection of penalties. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.020 Administration.

Except as otherwise provided herein, the Washougal director of public works shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the director of public works may be delegated by the director to other qualified Washougal personnel. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.030 Definitions.

Unless a provision explicitly states otherwise, the following terms and phrases, as used in this chapter, shall have the meanings hereinafter designated:

“Act” or “the Act” means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, (33 USC 1251 et seq.), as amended.

Ecology may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration-based limitations above. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.090 Right of revision.

The city reserves the right, following a public hearing and public input, to amend this chapter and to establish more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.100 Special agreement.

(1) Users with BOD or TSS levels higher than 300 mg/l in their wastestream must have an agreement with the city before commencing discharge. Within such agreements, the city may establish terms of the user’s discharge to the POTW including maximum flow rates and concentrations. The city may also establish monitoring schedules to insure compliance with the agreement and fees to recover costs associated with treating such wastes. The fees shall be as established according to Article XII of this chapter. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement including categorical standards. The user who wishes to make such a discharge must submit a formal request to the city 180 days before the discharge is to occur. The request must include all pertinent data about the discharge including, but not limited to, flow rate, time and duration of discharge(s), type and concentration of pollutants, and any other relevant information requested by the city.

(2) Users discharging or intending to discharge pollutants other than BOD and TSS, and claiming compatibility, must prove to the satisfaction of the director, that such pollutants are compatible with the POTW. The director may require any claim of compatibility to be endorsed by Ecology. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.110 Dilution.

No user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may request Ecology impose mass limitations on users which he/she believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.120 Pretreatment facilities.

(1) Users will procure, emplace, operate and maintain the wastewater facilities which combined with appropriate practices are necessary to achieve AKART as defined herein. Pretreatment facilities shall be designed to achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements within the time limitations specified by the EPA or the state, whichever is more stringent. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to Ecology for review and approval in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 173-240 WAC, and shall be disclosed to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to Ecology and meet discharge limitations under the provisions of this chapter. Such facilities shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user’s expense.

(2) Users shall comply with approved engineering reports, plans and specifications, and operations and maintenance manuals, and shall modify such documents to reflect any proposed modifications of industrial wastewater (pretreatment) facilities. Users shall submit proposals to modify pretreatment facilities to the department before implementation in accordance with Chapter 173-240 WAC. Users shall submit a copy of such revised plans and Ecology’s acceptance to the director before implementing changes to approved pretreatment facilities. The city may audit the compliance of any user, and require changes in operating procedures deemed necessary by the director to ensure continued compliance with applicable requirements. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.130 Deadline for compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements.

(1) Existing sources covered by one or more categorical pretreatment standards shall comply with such standards within three years of the date the standard is effective unless the pretreatment standard includes a more stringent compliance schedule. Ecology shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for the user are more restrictive than EPA’s categorical pretreatment standards.

(2) New sources and new users shall comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, but in no case shall time exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge. Prior to commencing discharge, such users shall install and start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.140 Additional pretreatment measures.

(1) Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

(2) Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing grease and oil in excess of the limits in WMC 14.24.080, or excessive amounts of sand. Such interceptors shall not be required for domestic users. All interceptors shall be of type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Each user shall maintain, inspect and clean required interceptors on a schedule that ensures they capture the intended pollutants, and prevents reintroduction into the storm or sanitary sewer systems. Users shall bear all expenses related to installation, maintenance, repair and disposal of removed materials.

(a) Food Service Users. Users who operate restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, bars or clubs, or hotel, hospital, sanitariums, factory or school kitchens, butcher shops, or other establishments where food (polar) grease may be introduced to the sewer system, shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of fat waste, oil and grease. Such pretreatment facilities shall be either a grease interceptor or grease trap as determined by the jurisdiction located outside the building, and installed in the wastewater line leading from sinks, drains or other fixtures where grease may be discharged. Grease interceptors shall be required on all new construction projects that have a Type 1 hood exhaust system. New grease interceptors or grease traps shall be in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code, and any other requirements by the city as set forth herein. Grease interceptors that include dishwasher effluent shall be sized to allow sufficient detention time to allow for cooling of the effluent. No more than four fixtures shall connect to an individual grease interceptor, and no sanitary facilities will be allowed to connect upstream of any grease interceptor. Subject to the director’s approval, dishwater effluent may be excluded from pretreatment. Grease traps inside the kitchen area will only be allowed under special circumstances and shall only be approved by the director on a case-by-case basis.

(b) Industrial/Commercial User. Users who operate automobile or truck repair facilities, steam cleaning facilities for motorized equipment, air compressor(s), or any other establishments or equipment where petroleum-based (nonpolar) grease and oil may be introduced to the sewer system, shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of oil and grease. These pretreatment facilities shall be oil/water separators or interceptors located to collect such mixture of grease, oil and water. Such facilities shall be in accordance with city and state standards.

(c) Retrofit of User Facilities. Users may be required to retrofit facilities which were constructed prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. The requirement to retrofit shall be on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the director for compliance with city, state and federal regulations. The director may require installation of grease interceptors, grease traps or other pretreatment facilities for those facilities that violate discharge prohibitions and supplemental limitations as set forth in this chapter. In all cases, existing food service users that have a Type 1 hood exhaust system shall be required to retrofit with an approved grease trap or interceptor that is sized in accordance with the current Uniform Plumbing Code and its appendices. In deciding whether to require a user to retrofit their facilities, the director shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to, the extent of potential harm caused by the discharge, the magnitude and duration of the discharge, economic detriment to the user, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other relevant factors. Grease interceptor or grease trap size shall be determined in accordance with the Uniform Plumbing Code and any other requirements by the city as set forth herein at the time the user is notified that facility modifications are required. Sizing of grease traps or interceptors will be reviewed and may be modified at the request of the local sewer jurisdiction. All costs incurred in retrofitting a user’s facility shall be the sole responsibility of the user.

(d) Maintenance of Grease Interceptors and/or Grease Traps. Users shall maintain grease interceptors and/or grease traps and/or other pretreatment equipment in a manner that shall prevent fat waste, oil or grease from being carried into the sewer system at all times. Authorized city employees shall be allowed access to grease traps and interceptors for the purpose of inspection and/or to verify compliance with this chapter. Fat waste, oil or grease removed from such a facility shall not be disposed of in the sanitary or storm sewer. A record of disposal shall be maintained for review by the Southwest Washington Health District and the local sewer jurisdiction.

(3) Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

(4) Each user discharging more than 10,000 gallons per day or 10 percent of the average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is less, may be required by the director to install and maintain, on his/her property and at his/her expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a 24-hour period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least 50 percent of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the director. The city may require the user to obtain a wastewater discharge permit solely for flow equalization, or to develop a slug control plan (WMC 14.24.150). (Ord. 1571 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.150 Accidental spill/slug discharge control plans.

(1) The director may require any user to install, properly operate, and maintain, at his/her own expense, facilities to prevent slugloads or accidental discharges of pollutants to the POTW. The director may require users to produce and/or implement spill plans developed in compliance with OSHA, health, fire and ecology regulations that address POTW discharges. When such plans are required by the director they shall contain as a minimum the following elements:

(a) A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

(b) A description of stored chemicals;

(c) Procedures for immediately notifying the city of any accidental or slugload discharges, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; and

(d) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slugload discharge, including, but not limited to, the following inspection and maintenance of storage areas; handling and transfer of materials; loading and unloading operations; control of plant site runoff; worker training; building of containment structures or equipment; and measures for emergency response.

(2) Users shall verbally notify the city’s wastewater treatment plant immediately upon the occurrence of a slug or accidental discharge of substances regulated by this chapter and take immediate actions to correct the situation. If the treatment plant cannot be reached, the user shall try to contact City Hall. If City Hall cannot be reached, the fire department shall be notified. Immediate notification does not require placing people in jeopardy of being harmed. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. The user shall follow-up with a written notification to the director containing the same information within seven days following the discharge.

(3) Any user who discharges an accidental discharge or slugload shall be liable for: 

(a) Recovery of any resultant expenses, losses and damages to the POTW; 

(b) Recovery of any fines or settlements levied upon the city on account thereof by any government agency or court of competent jurisdiction; and

(c) Applicable fines and penalties assessed by the city for noncompliance with this chapter. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.160 Septic or liquid hauled wastes.

(1) Septic tank and liquid waste haulers may introduce substances into the POTW only at a designated receiving structure and at such times as are established by the director. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director.

(2) Such wastes shall not violate any discharge prohibition or standard of this chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities shall be issued by the director.

(3) Septage haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, addresses of the sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste.

(4) Haulers of liquid wastes other than septage must provide full disclosure to the director of the source or sources of the wastewater, and such additional information as required by the director to characterize the wastewater. The director may issue an authorization on his/her own authority, or require haulers of industrial wastewater to obtain a waste discharge permit as a condition of discharge. No authorization to discharge such wastewater shall be granted until the director has determined to his satisfaction that the wastewater complies with all discharge standards, prohibitions and requirements of this chapter.

(5) The director may exercise absolute discretion in whether to accept any load of septage or hauled wastes. In determining whether to accept a load, the director may collect samples of each hauled load and/or require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.

(6) Fees for discharge of hauled wastes will be established as part of the user fee system as authorized in this chapter. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article III. Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirements


14.24.170 Wastewater discharge permitting – Requirements for discharge.

(1) No significant industrial user (SIU) shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first applying for a wastewater discharge permit from Ecology. The director may require proof of such application. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of his/her obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law including the requirement for applying AKART.

(2) The director may require other users, including liquid waste haulers, to apply for wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

(3) The director may also establish, and require users by letter, permit or rule, to implement best management practices as determined by the director.

(4) The city encourages all users seeking authorization to discharge to the POTW to complete a pollution prevention review before submitting their request to discharge to the director. The city may require users who must submit a pollution prevention plan under the state of Washington’s Hazardous Waste Reduction Act to provide this plan to the director as a condition of initial or continued discharge. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.180 Permit requirements for dangerous waste constituents.

(1) Obtain a written authorization to discharge the waste from the director, and either obtain specific authorization to discharge the waste in a wastewater discharge permit issued by Ecology, or accurately describe the wastestream in a temporary permit obtained pursuant to RCW 90.48.165. The description shall include at least:

(a) The name of the dangerous waste as set forth in Chapter 173-303 WAC, and the dangerous waste number;

(b) The mass of each constituent expected to be discharged;

(c) The type of discharge (continuous, batch or other);

(2) Compliance shall be obtained on the following schedule:

(a) Before discharge for new users;

(b) Within 30 days after becoming aware of a discharge of dangerous wastes to the POTW for existing users; and

(c) Within 90 days after final rules identifying additional dangerous wastes or new characteristics or criteria of dangerous waste are published for users discharging a newly listed dangerous waste. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article IV. Reporting Requirements


14.24.190 Disclosure of records.

All records and reports required by this chapter, any applicable state and federal regulation, or any permit or order issued thereunder, will be available on-site for review by the director during business hours, when activities are being conducted at the facility, and at all reasonable times. Failure to comply with this provision is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.200 Reports from unpermitted users.

All users not obligated to obtain a wastewater discharge permit from Ecology shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the director may require. The schedule and form of such reports, and the pollutant properties, flow rates, and other pertinent information to be reported shall be determined by the director. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.210 Reporting requirements for dangerous waste constituents.

Any user discharging 100 kilograms or more of dangerous waste in any calendar month to the

POTW where the pollutants are not reported through self monitoring under an applicable wastewater discharge permit, shall report to the director and Ecology, the following information to the extent that it is known or readily available to the user:

(1) The name of the dangerous waste as set forth in Chapter 173-303 WAC, and the dangerous waste number;

(2) The specific hazardous constituents;

(3) The estimated mass and concentration of such constituents in wastestreams discharged during the calendar month;

(4) The type of discharge (continuous, batch or other); and

(5) The estimated mass of dangerous waste constituents in wastestreams expected to be discharged in the next 12 months. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Users subject to monitoring requirements shall keep records of all monitoring activities required or voluntary. Monitoring records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the sampler; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.

(2) These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article V. Sampling and Analytical Requirements


14.24.230 Sampling requirements for users.

(1) Applicable Requirements. Users which discharge to the POTW shall abide by the applicable wastewater monitoring requirements of this chapter, any applicable order, and any state or federal regulation or permit, including a wastewater discharge permit. The director may require self-monitoring as a requirement of discharge to the POTW, or may conduct city monitoring of any discharge to the POTW.

(2) Categorical Users Sampling Requirements. Categorical users with combined discharge shall measure flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). Where feasible, such users shall sample immediately downstream from any pretreatment facilities unless the control authority determines end-of-pipe monitoring to be more stringent or applicable.

(3) Noncategorical Users. All other users, where required to sample, shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements.

(4) Data Required. All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that the samples are representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. Whenever a user samples and analyzes any regulated pollutant more frequently than required, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, the results of such analysis shall be submitted with the next required discharge report. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.240 Analytical requirements.

All pollutant analyses required to be reported, with the exception of flow and temperature, shall be performed by a laboratory registered or accredited under the provisions of Chapter 173-50 WAC. Sampling and analysis techniques used in collection, preservation, and analysis, shall be in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, a sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA or Ecology. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.250 City monitoring of wastewater.

The city shall follow the procedures required of users described in WMC 14.24.230 and 14.24.240 whenever conducting wastewater sampling of any industrial user when such sampling is conducted to ensure compliance with this chapter and applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

(2) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director, his or her agents or assigns, and representatives of state and federal authority will be allowed to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their respective duties.

(3) For users with wastewater discharge permits, the director, in coordination with Ecology, shall have the right to set up on the user’s property, at the city’s expense, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.270 Monitoring facilities.

(1) Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurements of each use process waste line connected to the city’s sewer system. Such facilities may be required by Ecology or the city. Monitoring facilities shall be situated on the user’s premises unless this would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user. In such cases, the director may allow the user to construct the facility in the public street or sidewalk area, providing it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.

(2) The director or applicable control authority may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system) when deemed appropriate.

(3) There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The user shall maintain the facility, sampling and measuring equipment at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at his/her own expense.

(4) All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Any devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be regularly calibrated, but no less frequently than annually, to ensure their accuracy. Calibration records will be available for inspection of the superintendent. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.280 Search warrants.

(1) If the director or a qualified inspector acting as his/her agent has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder or any wastewater discharge permit issued by Ecology, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the director shall seek issuance of a search and/or seizure warrant from the superior court. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the director in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city.

(2) In the event the director has reason to believe a situation represents an imminent threat to public health and safety, and where entry has been denied or the area is inaccessible, an agent of the director may enter in the company of a uniformed police officer, before a requested warrant has been produced, in order to determine if the suspected situation exists, and if so, to take such actions necessary to protect the public. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.290 Vandalism.

No person shall wilfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article VII. Confidential Information


14.24.300 Confidential information.

(1) Records kept by the city with respect to the nature and frequency of discharges from any user shall be available to the public without restriction unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to confidentiality under the law.

(2) Users shall clearly mark “confidential” on all areas of reports requested to be held confidential from the public. Upon request for this information, the city shall determine if such information is legally afforded this protection under the law. Only information marked “confidential” which the city determines qualifies as such shall be withheld from the public.

(3) Documents claimed as “confidential,” however, shall not be withheld from any state or federal agency responsible for oversight of the city’s NPDES permit or authority to implement the NPDES, or federal or state pretreatment programs. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article VIII. Administrative Enforcement Remedies


14.24.310 State responsibility for administrative actions.

The Washington State Department of Ecology is charged with permitting and regulating significant industrial users of the city POTW. Except for emergency actions, it shall be the policy of the director to coordinate actions in regard to control of such users with Ecology until such time as a local pretreatment program for the city may be authorized by the state. Failure to do so, however, shall not invalidate any action of the city authorized by this chapter. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.320 Notification of violation.

(1) Whenever the director finds that any industrial user has violated or is continuing to violate any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the director may serve upon such industrial user written notice of the violation.

(2) Within 10 days of receipt of a notice of violation, the user shall submit an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions to the director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.

(3) Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.330 Consent orders.

(1) The director is empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such consent orders shall include a specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time schedule also specified by the consent order.

(2) Compliance schedules, when included in consent orders, may not extend the compliance date beyond any applicable state or federal deadlines. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to WMC 14.24.340 and shall be judicially enforceable.

(3) Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a consent order by the user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or for any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the director. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.340 Compliance orders.

(1) Whenever the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the director may issue a compliance order to the industrial user responsible for the violation directing that, following a specified time period, wastewater services, including collection and treatment, shall be discontinued and/or applicable penalties imposed unless adequate pretreatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated and maintained.

(2) Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance beyond any applicable state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the industrial user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the industrial user.

(3) Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a compliance order by the industrial user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or for any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the director. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.350 Show cause hearing.

A user shall also have the right to a hearing prior to termination of the user’s wastewater services.

(2) Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served on an authorized representative of the user (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing date.

(3) A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.360 Cease and desist orders.

(1) When the director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order by Ecology, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur and may cause a violation of the POTW’s NPDES permit, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:

(a) Immediately cease such actions or discharges as described;

(b) Comply with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements;

(c) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

(2) Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.370 Emergency suspension of wastewater services.

(1) The director may immediately suspend wastewater services including collection and treatment, after informal notice to the user, if it appears to the city that such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to either the environment, normal operation of the POTW, or the health or welfare of any person or the general public.

(2) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately cease all wastewater discharges. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or the danger to the public. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has passed unless the termination processings in WMC 14.24.380 are initiated against the user.

(3) It is unlawful for any person to prevent or attempt to prevent the city from terminating wastewater services in an emergency situation, by barring entry, by physically interfering with city employees or contractors, or by any other means.

(4) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing authorized by this chapter.

(5) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.380 Termination of treatment services (nonemergency).

(1) The director shall have authority to terminate wastewater services, including collection and treatment, for any user upon determining that such user has:

(a) Refused access allowed by this chapter thereby preventing the implementation of any purpose of this chapter;

(b) Violated any provision of this chapter including the discharge prohibitions and standards of Article II; or

(c) Violated any lawful order of the city issued with respect to this chapter.

(2) For users holding permits to discharge to the POTW, violation of the following conditions is also grounds for terminating discharge services:

(a) Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents and characteristics;

(b) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents or characteristics;

(c) Violation of any condition of the user’s waste discharge permit.

(3) Issuance of a termination order by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article IX. Judicial Enforcement Remedies


14.24.390 Injunctive relief.

When the director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the superior court through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.400 Civil penalties.

(1) A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement not reserved by a permit by Ecology shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

(2) In addition to the penalty amounts assessable under subsection (1) of this section, the director may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city including penalties for noncompliance with the city’s NPDES permit to the extent attributable to the user.

(3) The city shall petition the superior court to impose, assess and recover such sums. In recommending the amount of civil liability, the director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires, and shall present this analysis as evidence in support of the recommended penalty.

(4) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.410 Criminal prosecution.

(1) A user which wilfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or a requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 per violation, per day, plus costs of prosecution or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by both fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the superior court.

(2) The above provision applies to any user which knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter.

(3) Where wilful or negligent introduction of a substance into the POTW causes personal injury or property damage, this action shall be in addition to any other civil or criminal action for personal injury or property damage available under the law. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.420 Remedies nonexclusive.

The provision in Articles VIII through XI of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions concurrently or sequentially against a noncompliant user or to take other actions as warranted by the circumstances. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article X. Supplemental Enforcement Actions


14.24.430 Water supply severance.

Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.440 Performance bonds and liability insurance.

The director may decline to reinstate wastewater service for any industrial user who has had its wastewater services suspended or terminated under the provisions of this chapter unless such industrial user, at the discretion of the director and the city council, either: (1) first files with the city a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve compliance; or (2) first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.450 Innovative settlements and supplemental environmental projects.

(1) In any enforcement action allowed under this chapter, the director may recommend and the city may agree to set aside all or portions of the recommended penalty amount in lieu of requiring completion of a project of environmental benefit to the POTW of equal or greater value. Such projects must be agreed to by the user.

(2) In recommending this option, the director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the net environmental benefit, the ability of the project to help achieve or ensure compliance, the willingness of the party to change the circumstances that led to the noncompliance, and the responsible party’s technical and financial ability to successfully complete the project.

(3) In enforcement actions taken by the Department of Ecology, the city may make written recommendations either for or against an innovative settlement agreement with a noncompliant user based on these same criteria. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article XI. Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations


14.24.460 General prohibited discharge standards.

(1) The city may allow an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in WMC 14.24.050(1) and (2)(c) through (g). Such defense requires the user to prove to the satisfaction of the director that:

(a) The user did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference;

(b) The discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit; and

(c) In the case of interference, the user was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

14.24.470 Upset.

(1) Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

(2) An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

(a) An upset occurred; the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; and it was not due to improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation;

(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

(c) The user has verbally notified the city’s wastewater treatment plant (or City Hall or fire department as described in WMC 14.24.150) immediately, if possible, but no later than 24 hours upon becoming aware of the upset. Immediate notification does not require placing people in jeopardy of being harmed. The notification must include the following information. A written report must have been submitted within five days:

(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(ii) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

(3) Users will only have the opportunity for a judicial determination on a claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. In any such enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)


14.24.480 Bypass.

(1) A user may allow a bypass to occur if it does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated and if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operations. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

(2) Requirements for bypasses subject to pretreatment standards or requirements:

(a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass.

(b) An industrial user shall give verbal notification to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours of becoming aware of the bypass, and submit a written report to the director within five days of becoming aware of the bypass.

(c) The written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report if the verbal notification has been received within 24 hours.

(3) Exceptions. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

(c) The user submitted notice as required under subsection (2) of this section.

(4) The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (3) of this section. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

Article XII. Industrial Waste Collection and Treatment Rates


14.24.490 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this section to provide for the payment of charges from industrial users to compensate the city for the cost of installing, operating, maintaining and further improving the POTW and for the cost of administration of the pretreatment program established herein. (Ord. 1221 § 1, 1996)

(3) Unauthorized Reinstatement. Anybody commits an offense and violates this chapter if the person reinstates municipal separate storm sewer system access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the director. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


14.36.090 Industrial or construction activity discharges.

Any person or activity subject to an NPDES stormwater discharge permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the federal Environmental Protection Agency shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city prior to allowing discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


14.36.100 Monitoring of discharges.

(1) Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial or commercial activity, including but not limited to construction activity.

(2) Access to Facilities.

(a) The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the director.

(b) Premises owners, occupiers and their agents shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

(c) The city shall have the right to install on any permitted premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the director to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises’ stormwater discharge.

(d) The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary.

(e) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the premises to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the director. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.

(f) Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted premises are violations of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the owner or operator of a premises with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense and violates this chapter if the person denies the city reasonable access to the permitted premises for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.

(g) If the director has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

(h) In addition, the director may suspend water, sanitary sewer and/or storm drain access or access to any party refusing to provide or delaying access. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


14.36.110 Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of BMPs.

The city has adopted requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United States.

The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a premises which is, or may be, the source of an illegal discharge, may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

The owner or operator of a stormwater facility shall maintain, at its own expense, all facility functions in accordance with the maintenance manual associated with said facility. If no maintenance manual is known to exist, the latest version of Clark County’s “Stormwater Facility Maintenance Manual” shall be utilized. Any discharges from an unmaintained stormwater facility shall be considered illegal discharges and punishable in accordance with this chapter. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


14.36.120 Watercourse protection.

Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person’s lessee, shall not pollute, contaminate, introduce new vegetation into, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse, and must comply with all critical areas protection requirements established in Chapter 16.04 WMC. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, in a manner that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)


14.36.130 Notification of spills.

Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a premises or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a premises or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or watercourses, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the director in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city of Washougal within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010)

(c) Investigation Fees – Work Without a Permit. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee required by this code. The minimum investigation fee shall be the same as the minimum fee set forth in WMC 3.97.010 (Building Permit Fees). The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of the building codes and any penalty prescribed by law.

(d) Work Not Included in a Permit. A building permit holder that has expanded the scope of work without prior approval from the building official or has submitted inaccurate or incomplete information about the total work to be done may be assessed an investigation fee. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the difference between the permit fees for the total amount of work, less the amount of work shown on the permit. The permit holder is also required to obtain a permit for the additional work described above.

(e) Fee Refunds. The building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid hereunder, which was erroneously paid or collected. The building official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this code.

(g) Reinspection Fee. A reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. This section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the building official. To obtain reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefor in writing on a form furnished for that purpose and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with WMC 3.97.050 (Miscellaneous Building Fees). In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of work will be performed until the required fees have been paid.

The plan review fees specified in this section are separate fees from the permit fees and are in addition to the permit fees.

(c) Incomplete or Changed Plans. When plans are incomplete or changed so as to require additional plan review, an additional plan review fee shall be charged at the rate shown in WMC 3.97.030 (Mechanical Permit Fees).

(d) Expiration of Plan Review. Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official. The building official may extend the time for the action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days on request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented the action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee.

(e) Investigation Fees – Work Without a Permit. When work for which a permit is required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining a permit, a special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee that would be required by this code if a permit were to be issued. The payment of an investigation fee shall not exempt a person from compliance with all other provisions of this code nor from a penalty prescribed by law.

(f) Work Not Included in a Permit. A mechanical permit holder that has expanded the scope of work without prior approval from the building official or has submitted inaccurate or incomplete information about the total work to be done may be assessed an investigation fee.

The permit holder is also required to obtain a permit for the additional work described above.

(g) Fee Refunds. The building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid hereunder, which was erroneously paid or collected. The building official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this code. The building official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is done.

15.45.030 School impact fee – Capital facilities plan.

In order to collect school impact fees on behalf of a school district, said school district’s capital facilities plan shall be adopted as a portion of the city comprehensive land use plan in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(1) Plan Submittal. A school district requesting impact fees shall submit to the city every four years an updated capital facilities plan adopted by the respective school board consisting of the following elements:

(a) The district’s capacity over the next six years based upon an inventory of the district’s facilities either existing or under construction;

(b) A forecast of future needs for school facilities based upon the district’s enrollment projections;

(c) At least a six-year financing plan component, updated as necessary to maintain at least a six-year forecast period, for financing needed school facilities within projected funding levels;

(d) Application of the formula set out in this chapter based upon information contained in the capital facilities plan. Separate fees shall be calculated for single-family and multifamily types of dwelling units, based upon the student generation rates determined by the district for each type of dwelling units. If insufficient information is available for a district to calculate a multifamily student generation rate, a county-wide average shall be utilized. For purposes of this chapter, mobile homes and each unit of a duplex shall be treated as single-family dwellings.

(2) Board Action. No new or revised school impact fees shall be effective until adopted by the respective school board following a duly advertised public hearing to consider the school district’s capital facilities plan or plan update.

(3) Interlocal Agreement. School impact fees shall not become effective until the school district has entered into an interlocal agreement with the city. (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1455 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1164 § 3, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 3, 1994)


15.45.040 School impact fee component.

The impact fee component for schools shall be separately calculated for each participating school district using the following formula:

SIF = [CS (SF) – (TC) – (SM)] × A – FC

(1) “SIF” means the school component of the total development impact fee.

(2) “CS” means the cost of each type of facility listed in a school district’s capital facilities plan attributable to new growth divided by the number of students representing a six-year increase in students for each type of school facility. Each type of facility means elementary school, middle school and high school.

(3) “SF” means student factor. The student factor is the number of students typically generated from one residential unit for each type of school facility. This is determined by dividing the total number of residential units in a school district into the current enrollment numbers for each type of school facility. The student factor for each school district shall be calculated annually. Separate student factors shall be calculated for single-family and multifamily dwelling units.

(4) “SM” means state match. State match is that amount received from the state of Washington towards school construction costs. The state match component of the formula is that amount representing the per student amount of state matching funds. This is calculated for each type of facility as: student factor times Boechk index (average annual construction cost of a school facility per square foot) times square foot standard per student established by the superintendent of public instruction times state match percentage (that percentage of the total cost of a school facility funded by state funds). The state match for each school district shall be calculated each time the impact fee is revised.

(5) “TC” means tax credit. This is calculated as:

	(1 + i)10) – 1	x	average assessed value for the dwelling unit within a school district 

	i(1 + i)10

	 	x	current school district capital property tax levy rate.

where i = the average annual interest rate as stated in the Bond Buyer Twenty Bond General Obligation Bond Index. The tax credit shall be calculated each time the impact fee is revised.

(6) “FC” means facilities credit. This is the value of any improvement listed in a school district’s capital facilities plan provided by the developer.

(7) “A” means an adjustment for the portion of the anticipated increase in the public share resulting from exempt residential development proratable to new residential development. This adjustment for school impact is determined to be 85 percent.

(8) As of March 23, 2016, the impact fee amount within District No. 112’s boundary will be as follows:

(a) Five thousand six hundred dollars per single-family residential unit, to include a manufactured or mobile home residential unit placed on an individual lot.

(b) Five thousand eight hundred dollars per multifamily residential unit to include a manufactured or mobile home residential unit placed within a manufactured or mobile home park.

(9) As of March 23, 2016, the impact fee amount within District No. 117’s boundary will be as follows:

(a) Five thousand three hundred seventy-one dollars per single-family residential unit, to include a manufactured or mobile home residential unit placed on an individual lot.

(b) Five thousand three hundred seventy-one dollars per multifamily residential unit, to include a manufactured or mobile home residential unit placed within a manufactured or mobile home park. (Ord. 1849 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1790 § 1, 2016; Ord. 1788 § 1, 2016; Ord. 1721 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 1719 § 1 (Exh. A), 2011; Ord. 1655 § 1, 2010; Ord. 1524 § 2, 2005; Ord. 1523 § 2, 2005; Ord. 1463 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1461 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1366 §§ 1, 2, 1999; Ord. 1358 § 1, 1999; Ord. 1164 § 4, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 4, 1994)


15.45.050 Assessment of impact fees.

(1) The city shall collect impact fees from any applicant seeking residential development approval from the city of any development activity within the city, where such development activity requires the issuance of a building permit. This may include the expansion of existing uses which creates a demand for additional school facilities. In addition to the impact fee, the city shall collect from the applicant an administrative service fee of one percent of the total amount of the impact fee(s), per application.

(2) Impact fees shall be assessed at the time a sufficiently complete building application that complies with existing zoning ordinances and building codes is submitted for each unit in the development. Impact fees shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued, or at a time approved through the impact fee deferral program, for each unit in the development. In the case of manufactured homes and associated parks, impact fees shall be collected at the time of site plan approval. When a single manufactured or mobile home is being placed on a single lot, impact fees shall be collected at the time a building permit is issued. That temporary placement of a mobile home or manufactured home presently authorized under the Washougal Municipal Code shall not require payment of impact fees.

(3) Except if otherwise exempt, the city shall not issue the required building permit unless the impact fees have been paid. (Ord. 1804 § 2 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1164 § 5, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 5, 1994)


15.45.060 Credits.

A feepayer can request that a credit or credits be awarded to him/her for the value of dedicated land, improvements or construction provided by the feepayer if the land, improvements and/or the facility constructed are included within the adopted capital facilities plan or the district makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan. The feepayer shall direct the request for a credit or credits to the district. The district shall first determine the general suitability of the land, improvements, and/or construction for the district’s adopted capital facilities plan or the board of directors for the district may make the finding that such land improvements, and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan of the district. The district shall forward its determination to the city, including cases where the district determines that the dedicated land improvements and/or construction are not suitable for the district’s purposes. The city may adopt the determination of the district and may award or decline to award a credit, or the city may make an alternative determination and set forth in writing the rationale for the alternative determination. In the event the land, improvements and/or facilities are accepted by both the district and the city, the feepayer shall be responsible for supplying an independent appraisal based on objective standards which indicates the fair market value of the dedicated land, improvements and/or facilities. The credit amount shall be applied to the impact fee calculated for the particular development. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the impact fee due and owing by the feepayer, neither the district nor the city shall be liable to the feepayer for the difference. (Ord. 1164 § 6, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 6, 1994)


15.45.070 Appeals.

(1) Any feepayer may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a building permit. Appeals regarding the impact fees imposed on any development activity may only be taken by the feepayer of the property where such development activity will occur. No appeal shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at issue have been paid.

(2) Determinations of the city staff with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity or the availability or value of a credit, can be appealed to the city council pursuant to this section.

(3) Appeals shall be taken within 10 working days of payment of the fee or within 10 working days of the city’s issuance of a written determination of a credit or exemption decision by filing with the city a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and depositing the necessary fee, which is set forth in the existing fee schedules for appeals of land use decisions. (Ord. 1164 § 7, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 7, 1994)


15.45.080 Authorization for school interlocal agreement – Establishment of schools impact account.

(1) The city is authorized to execute, on behalf of the city, an interlocal agreement for the collection, expenditure and reporting of school impact fees; provided, that such interlocal agreement complies with the provisions of this section.

(2) School impact fees shall not be collected on behalf of the district. The district enters into an interlocal agreement with the city providing for submittal of a capital facilities plan, fund administration, report of expenditures, allocation of risk, and other appropriate matters.

(3) On an annual basis, pursuant to the interlocal agreement, the district shall provide a report to the city on the schools impact account, showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the public improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. (Ord. 1164 § 8, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 8, 1994)

(Ord. 1164 § 9, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 9, 1994)


15.45.100 Refunds.

(1) If a district fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within the time period specified in RCW 82.02.070 from the date the fees were paid unless extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. The district shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of claimants that they are entitled to a refund. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis.

(2) Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the city and/or the district, within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises, or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.

(3) Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by a district and expended on the appropriate public facilities.

(4) Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city or the district. (Ord. 1758 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1164 § 10, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 10, 1994)

(4) In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of public improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay the principal on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. (Ord. 1164 § 11, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 11, 1994)


15.45.120 Review.

Impact fees shall be reviewed by the council as it may deem necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the annual update of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1164 § 12, 1995; Ord. 1135 § 12, 1994)


15.45.130 School impact fees – Exemptions.

The school impact fee set forth herein is generated from the formula for calculating impact fees as set forth in this chapter. The amount of the impact fees is determined by information contained in the capital facilities plan of the district, as appended to the city’s comprehensive plan. All new residential developments in that portion of the district located in the city will be charged the school impact fee; provided, that the following exemptions shall apply:

(1) Any development activity or project which has submitted a technically complete building permit application prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be exempted from the payment of the impact fees.

The city council of the city finds and determines that new growth and residential development in the city creates additional demand and need for parks, open spaces and recreational facilities in the city, and the council finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the costs for new parks, open space and recreational facilities needed to serve the new growth and development in the city. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the council adopts the ordinance codified in this chapter to assess impact fees on new residential development within the city. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of this council in establishing the impact fee program. (Ord. 1175 § 1, 1995)

15.62.030 Park impact fee – Capital facilities plan.

In order to collect park, open space or recreational facilities impact fees, the city’s capital facilities plan shall be adopted as a portion of the city’s comprehensive land use plan.

(1) The city’s capital facilities plan shall consist of the following elements:

(a) The city’s capacity over the next six years, based upon an inventory of the city’s facilities either existing, or under construction;

(b) The forecast of future needs for park, open space or recreational facilities based upon the city’s residency projections;

(d) Application of the formula set out in this chapter based upon information obtained in the capital facilities plan. A separate fee should be calculated for single-family and multifamily types of dwelling units, based upon the residency generated rates determined by the city for each type of dwelling unit. If insufficient information is available to calculate a multifamily student generation link, a county-wide average should be utilized. For purposes of this chapter, mobile homes and each unit of a duplex should be treated as a single-family dwelling.

(2) Council Action. No new or revised parks, open space and recreation impact fee should be effective until adopted by council following a duly advertised public hearing to consider the city’s capital facilities plan or plan update. (Ord. 1175 § 3, 1995)


15.62.040 Park, open space and recreational facilities component formula.

The impact fee component for parks, open space and recreational facilities shall be calculated using the following formula:

	PIF	=	C x S x Y x A

	P

Single-Family:

	PIF	=	$161,239 x 5 x 2.59 x .90%	=	$1,880.00

	1,000

Multifamily:

	PIF	=	$161,239 x 5 x 2.13 x .90%	=	$1,550.00

	1,000

(1) “PIF” means the park and recreational facility component of the total development impact fee.

(2) “C” means the average cost per acre for land plus an additional development cost of $40,000 per acre. Such cost may be adjusted periodically, but not more often than once every year. Park development cost shall be based on actual, recent comparable construction and shall include associated project improvements such as streets.

(3) “S” means the parks standard in acres per 1,000 residents for neighborhood parks and community parks established in the comprehensive plan to total five acres.

(4) “P” means 1,000 people.

(5) “Y” means the average number of occupants per dwelling unit, or 2.59 occupants for a single-family dwelling unit and 2.13 occupants for any multifamily dwelling unit.

(6) “A” means an adjustment for the portion of anticipated additional tax revenue resulting from a development that is proratable to system improvements contained in the capital facilities plan. The adjustment for park impacts is determined to be 10 percent, so that “A” equals 90 percent.

(7) As of the date of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter the park, open space and recreational facility impact fee will be $1,880 for single-family residential unit to include the manufactured or mobile home residential unit placed on an individual lot and $1,550 for a multiple-family residential unit, to include a manufactured or a mobile home residential unit to be placed in a manufactured or mobile home park. (Ord. 1566 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1175 § 4, 1995)


15.62.050 Assessment of impact fees.

(1) The city shall collect impact fees from any applicant seeking residential development approval from the city for any development activity within the city, where such development activity requires the issuance of a building permit. This may include the expansion of existing uses which create the demand for additional school facilities.

(2) Impact fees shall be assessed at the time a sufficiently completed building application that complies with zoning ordinances and building codes is submitted for each unit in the development. Impact fees shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued, or at a time approved through the impact fee deferral program, for each unit of the development. In the case of manufactured homes and associated parks, impact fees shall be collected at the time of site plan approval. When a single manufactured or mobile home is being placed on a single lot, impact fees should be collected at the time a building permit is issued.

(3) Except if otherwise exempt, the city should not issue the required building permit unless or until the impact fees have been paid. (Ord. 1664 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1175 § 5, 1995)


15.62.060 Credits.

A feepayer can request that a credit, or credits, can be awarded to him/her for the value of dedicated land, improvements, construction provided by the feepayer, with the land, improvements and/or the facilities plan or the district makes the finding that such land, improvements and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan. The feepayer shall direct the request for a credit or credits to the city. The city shall first determine the suitability of land, improvements and/or construction for the city’s purposes. Second, the city shall determine whether the land, improvements and/or the facility constructed are included within the city’s adopted capital facilities plan, or the council for the city may make the finding that such land, improvements and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan of the city. The city will make a determination as to whether dedicated land, improvements and/or construction are not suitable for the city’s purposes. The city may decline to award a credit, or the city may make an alternative determination and set forth in writing a rationale for the alternative determination. In the event, the land improvements and/or facilities are accepted by the city, the feepayer shall be responsible for supplying an independent appraiser, based on objective standards which indicates the fair market value of the dedicated land, improvements and/or facilities. The credited amount shall be applied to the impact fee calculated for the particular development. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the fee, the feepayer shall pay the difference. In the event the amount exceeds the amount of the impact fee due and owed by the feepayer, the city shall not be liable to the feepayer for the difference. (Ord. 1175 § 6, 1995)

(d) In the case of owner/occupied dwellings, adequate documentation that such housing will only be sold or leased at affordable rates to a low-income household for a period of 10 years, and

(e) Adequate documentation in the event that the use of the property requiring the required period is no longer used for low-income housing, the owner shall pay the impact fee, plus interest from which the owner or any prior owner was exempt;

(9) Upon application, the developer, supported by studies and data, may request from the city a reduction or elimination to the impact fee, based on unusual circumstances of specific cases. Determination by the city on whether development should be exempt from payment of any impact fees or whether the impact fee amount shall be reduced shall be appealed pursuant to WMC 15.62.070;

(10) The impact fee for exempt development shall be calculated as provided for in the chapter and paid for with public funds. Such payment may be made by including such amounts in the public share of the system improvements undertaken within the applicable service area;

(11) Temporary placement of a mobile home or manufactured home. (Ord. 1884 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 1175 § 11, 1995)


15.62.120 Existing authority unimpaired.

Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the feepayer or the proponent of the development activity to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development, pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental developments accompanying the underlying development approval process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent to Chapters 43.21C and 82.02 RCW.

15.64.010 Findings.

The city council finds and determines that new growth and development in the city creates additional demand and need for public streets and roads in the city, and the council finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the costs for new public streets and roads needed to serve the new growth and development in the city. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the council adopts the ordinance codified in this chapter to assess impact fees on new residential, commercial or industrial development within the city. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of this council in establishing the impact fee program. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 1, 1995)


15.64.020 Definitions.

“Impact fee” means the payment of money imposed by the city on development activity pursuant to this chapter as a condition of granting development approval in order to pay for the public streets and roads needed to serve new growth and development. “Impact fee” does not include a reasonable permit fee, an application fee, the administrative fee for collecting and handling impact fees, or cost of reviewing independent fee calculations.

“Impact fee deferral program” shall mean the most current program/policy established by the city council to allow for required impact fees, associated with a permit, to be deferred or paid later at a time, as established under the program/policy, when the project is closer to completion.

Any improvement of a facility included in the capital facilities plan adopted by the council should be considered a project improvement. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1664 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 2, 1995)


15.64.030 Transportation impact fee – Capital facilities plan.

In order to collect transportation impact fees, the city’s capital facilities plan shall be adopted as a portion of the city’s comprehensive land use plan.

(1) The city’s capital facilities plan shall consist of the following elements:

(a) The city’s capacity over the next six years, based upon an inventory of the city’s facilities either existing, or under construction;

(b) The forecast of future needs for public streets and roads based upon the city’s residency projections;

(c) A six-year financial plan component, updated as necessary, to maintain at least a six-year forecast for financing needed within projected funding levels;

(d) Application of the formula set out in this chapter based upon information obtained in the capital facilities plan. A separate fee should be calculated for land use designation as determined by the Trip Generation Manual, Current Edition. For purposes of this chapter, mobile homes and each unit of a duplex should be treated as a single-family dwelling.

(2) Council Action. No new or revised transportation impact fee should be effective until adopted by the council following a duly advertised public hearing to consider the city’s capital facilities plan or plan update. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 3, 1995)


15.64.040 Public streets and roads component formula.

(1) The cost per trip value (CPT) is for all uses within the city UGA. Using the cost per trip value and multiplier value taken from the Trip Generation Manual, an impact fee can be calculated for a particular land use. The Trip Generation Manual, current edition, is a reference manual prepared by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and includes trip generation rates for multiple land uses. By finding the appropriate trip generation rate in the Trip Generation Manual and multiplying that number by the cost per trip, the correct impact fee for a specific land use can be determined. 

(2) The cost per daily weekday trip shall be established by the transportation capital facilities plan for the current year.

(3) The impact fee component for the purpose of public streets and roads shall be calculated using the following formula: 

Impact Fee = CPT × Number of Daily Trips1, 2, 3

1For some retail commercial land uses, a “business enhancement factor (BEF)” adjustment may be provided based on the City of Washougal Traffic Impact Fee Business Enhancement Factor (BEF) Program Technical Document in effect at the time of a technically complete application.

2For some land uses (e.g., retail), a substantial amount of traffic is already passing by the property and merely interrupts a trip between two other locations. These pass-by trips do not add to the impact on the surrounding street system. As a result, pass-by trips are subtracted from the total trips generated by each type of land use. The remaining trips are considered “new” to the street system and are therefore subject to TIF calculation. Pass-by trip percentages are derived primarily from ITE data and from available surveys conducted around the country.

3The TIF fee will be reduced for the current documented transportation trips to a development site.

(4) The number of daily trips and the transportation impact fee shall be determined by the community development director or a designee, using the Trip Generation Manual, latest edition, as a guide. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1665 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1636 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1567 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 4, 1995)


15.64.050 Assessment of impact fees.

(1) The city shall collect impact fees from any applicant seeking residential, commercial or industrial development approval from the city for any development activity within the city, where such development activity requires the issuance of a building permit or is a new use of a property. This may include the expansion of existing uses which create the demand for additional transportation facilities.

(2) Impact fees shall be assessed at the time a sufficiently completed building application that complies with zoning ordinances and building codes is submitted for each unit in the development. Impact fees shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued, or at a time approved through the impact fee deferral program, for each unit of the development. In the case of manufactured homes and associated parks, impact fees shall be collected at the time of site plan approval. When a single manufactured or mobile home is being placed on a single lot, impact fees should be collected at the time a building permit is issued. Impact fees shall be assessed at the time of site plan review approval for other uses subject to transportation impact fees.

(3) Except if otherwise exempt, the city should not issue the required building permit unless or until the impact fees have been paid. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1664 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 5, 1995)


15.64.060 Credits.

A feepayer can request that a credit, or credits, can be awarded to him/her for the value of dedicated land, improvements, and/or construction provided by the feepayer, with the land, improvements and/or the facilities plan or the city makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan. The feepayer shall direct the request for a credit or credits to the city. The city shall first determine the suitability of land, improvements and/or construction for the city’s purposes. Second, the city shall determine whether the land, improvements and/or the facility constructed are included within the city’s adopted capital facilities plan, or the council for the city may make the finding that such land, improvements and/or facilities would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan of the city. The city will make a determination as to whether dedicated land, improvements and/or construction are suitable for the city’s purposes. The city may decline to award a credit, or the city may make an alternative determination and set forth in writing a rationale for the alternative determination. In the event the land improvements and/or facilities are accepted by the city, the feepayer shall be responsible for supplying an independent appraiser, based on objective standards which indicate the fair market value of the dedicated land, improvements and/or facilities. The credited amount shall be applied to the impact fee calculated for the particular development. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the fee, the feepayer shall pay the difference. In the event the amount exceeds the amount of the impact fee due and owed by the feepayer, the city shall not be liable to the feepayer for the difference. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 6, 1995)


15.64.070 Appeals.

Any feepayer may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a building permit.

(1) Appeals regarding impact fees imposed on any development activity may only be taken by the feepayer of the property where such development activity will occur. No appeal shall be permitted unless and until the impact fee at issue has been paid.

(2) Determination of the city staff in respect to the applicability of impact fees to a given development activity or the availability of value of a credit can be appealed to the city council pursuant to this section.

(3) An appeal should be taken within 10 working days of payment of the fee, or within 10 working days of the city’s issuance of a written determination of a credit or exemption decision, by filing with the city notice of an appeal specifying the grounds thereon and depositing the necessary fee, which is set forth in the existing fee schedules for appeals of land use decisions.

15.64.080 Refunds.

If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within the time period specified in RCW 82.02.070 from the date the fees are paid, unless extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid shall receive a refund of such fees.

(1) The city shall notify the potential claimants, by first class mail to the claimants, that they are entitled to a refund. Determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees should be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis.

(2) Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for refunds of the fees to the city within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the notice is given, whichever comes later.

(3) Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within the one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on appropriate public facilities.

(4) Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city. (Ord. 1769 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1758 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1542 § 1, 2006; Ord. 1471 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1181 § 8, 1995)

(Ord. 1664 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.030 Fire impact fee capital facilities plan.

In order to collect fire impact fees, the city must first adopt a fire capital facilities plan as an element of the city’s comprehensive plan.

The city’s capital facilities plan for fire protection services shall consist of the following elements:

(1) The city’s capacity over the next six years, based on an inventory of the city’s fire facilities both existing and under construction.

(2) The forecast of future needs for fire facilities based upon the city’s population projections.

(3) A six-year financial plan component, updated as necessary, to maintain at least a six-year forecast for financing needed within projected funding levels.

(4) Application of the formula set out in this chapter based upon the information in the capital facilities plan.

(5) Council Action. No new or revised impact fee shall be effective until adopted by council following a duly advertised public hearing to consider the city’s capital facilities plan or plan update. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.040 Fire impact fee formula.

The calculation for fire impact fees for single-family residential structures shall be based on the following formula:

	FIF =	Capital cost × (percent attributable to new growth) × adjustment for past and future taxes

	New dwelling units

	FIF =	($2,756,000 × 18%)	=	$628.00

	789

	 	($628.00 × 20%)	=	$126.00

	 	$628.00 − $126.00	=	$502.00

Maximum fire impact fee per each new single-family residential unit = $502.00

The calculation for fire impact fees for multifamily units and all nonresidential uses (commercial and industrial and others) is calculated to be $0.31 per square foot; $502.00/1,600 square feet (the average size of a new house per the Palmer Growth Pietka Housing Report for Washougal, December 15, 2000).

New multiple-family units and nonresidential uses = $0.31 per square foot

(Ord. 1525 § 3, 2005; Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.050 Fire impact fee assessment.

The city shall collect fire impact fees from applicants seeking development approvals from the city for any development activity in the city for which building permits are required. This will include the expansion of existing uses, which create the demand for fire protection services.

Fire impact fees shall be assessed at the time of a sufficiently complete building permit application that complies with the city’s zoning ordinances and building and development codes. Fire impact fees shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued, or at a time approved through the impact fee deferral program.

Except if otherwise exempt, the city shall not issue the required building permit unless or until the fire impact fees are paid. (Ord. 1664 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.055 Impact fee reduction for providing residential fire sprinklers to single-family homes.

(1) A person required to pay a fee pursuant to RCW 43.21C.060 for system improvements shall not be required to pay a fire impact fee under RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.090 for those same system improvements.

(2) A person installing a residential fire sprinkler system in a single-family home shall not be required to pay the fire operations portion of the impact fee. The exempted fire operations impact fee shall not include the proportionate share related to the delivery of emergency medical services.

(3) Twenty percent of the Washougal department’s emergency responses can be considered fire operation responses. A reduction of 20 percent in fire impact fees shall be imposed on all single-family dwellings when a residential sprinkler system is installed. (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013)


15.65.060 Credits.

A feepayer can request that a credit, or credits, be awarded to the feepayer for the value of dedicated land, improvements, and construction by the feepayer if the city finds that such improvements or facilities serves to satisfy the goals of the fire department capital facilities plan. The feepayer shall first direct the request for credits to the city with a description of why the credits should be awarded. The city shall then determine if the improvements, land or construction is included in the capital facilities plan and that the city council determines that such improvements, land and construction meets the goals of the fire department capital facilities plan. The city may decline the request or make an alternative decision. In the event that the land, improvements or facilities are accepted by the city, the feepayer shall be responsible for supplying an independent appraiser to provide an appraisal report based on objective standards which indicates the fair market value of the dedicated land improvements or facilities. The credited amount shall be applied to the impact fee calculated for the particular development sponsored by the feepayer. If the amount of the credit is less than the amount of the fee, the feepayer shall pay the difference. If the amount of the credit exceeds the value of the impact fee, the city shall not be responsible for the difference. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.070 Appeals.

Any feepayer may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a building permit.

(1) Appeals regarding fire impact fees imposed on any development activity may only be taken by the feepayer of the property where such development activity will occur. No appeal shall be permitted unless and until the impact fee at issue has been paid.

(2) Determination of the city staff in respect to the applicability of fire impact fees to a given development activity or the availability of a credit, can be appealed to city council pursuant to this section.

(3) An appeal shall be taken within 10 working days of payment of the impact fees under protest or within 10 working days of the city’s issuance of a written determination of a credit or exemption decision by filing with the city a notice of appeal giving the reasons for the appeal with accompanying appeal fee set forth in the existing fee schedule for land use decisions. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.080 Refunds.

If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within the time period specified in RCW 82.02.070 from the date the fees were paid, unless extraordinary circumstances or reasons exist, the current owner of the property on which the impact fees were paid shall receive a refund of such fees.

(1) The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail that they are entitled to a refund. Determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis.

(2) Owners seeking a refund must submit a written request for refunds of the fees to the city within one year of the date the right to claim a refund arises or notice is given whichever comes later.

(3) Any impact fees for which no application has been made within the one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on appropriate fire facilities.

(4) Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city. (Ord. 1758 § 1 (Exh. A), 2014; Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.090 Use of fire impact fees.

Pursuant to this chapter, fire impact fees shall be used for fire facilities that will reasonably benefit the city and its residents.

(1) Fees shall not be used to make up deficiencies in city facilities serving an existing development;

(2) Fees shall not be used for maintenance and operations including personnel;

(3) Fire impact fees shall be used for but not limited to land acquisition, site improvements, engineering and architectural services, permitting, financing and administrative expenses and applicable mitigation costs, capital equipment pertaining to fire protection facilities;

(4) Fire impact fees may also be used to recoup public improvement costs incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements; and

(5) In the event bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for fire facility improvements, impact fees may be used to pay the principal on such bonds. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.100 Review.

Impact fees shall be reviewed by the planning commission with recommendations to city council as it may be necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with the annual review and update of the capital facilities plan and the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.110 Exemptions.

The fire impact fees are generated from the formula for calculating the fees as found in this chapter. The amount of the impact fees is determined by the information contained in the adopted fire department capital facilities plan, as appended to the city’s comprehensive plan. All new development located in the city will be charged a fire impact fee; provided, that the following exemptions shall apply. Any development activity or project, which has submitted a technically complete building permit application prior to the effective date of this ordinance, shall be exempt from the payment of fire impact fees. The following shall be exempt from fire impact fees:

(1) Replacement of a structure with a new structure at the same site and when such replacement is within 12 months, or for a longer time period approved by the director, of demolition or destruction of the precious structure.

(2) Alteration or expansion of or remodeling of an existing dwelling or structure where no new units are created and the use is not changed.

(3) Construction of an accessory residential structure.

(4) Miscellaneous improvements including, but not limited to, fences, walls, swimming pools, and signs.

(5) Demolition of or moving an existing structure within the city from one site to another.

(6) Low-income housing developed by individuals, nonprofit corporations, or housing authority may be exempted from impact fees at the discretion of city staff subject to:

(a) Fiscal impact analysis of the effect upon low-income housing of impact fees and how exempting housing from impact fees would forward the goals for low-income housing in the city and Clark County.

(b) That adequate documentation be; provided, that the housing will remain available for low-income persons for a 10-year period of time at affordable rents.

(c) Staff may make partial exemptions for market rate and low-income units providing that documentation is provided for the low-income units that they will meet the specifications for household income, rent levels and the affordable rent will be available for 10 years.

(d) In the case of owner-occupied dwellings, that such housing will be sold or leased at affordable rates to low-income households for a period of 10 years.

(7) The impact fee for exempt development shall be calculated as provided by this chapter and paid with public funds. Such payments may be made by including such amounts in the public share of the system improvements undertaken within the city for fire protection services and facilities. (Ord. 1884 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 1434 § 1, 2002)


15.65.120 Authority unimpaired.

Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the feepayer to mitigate adverse and environmental affects of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapters 43.21C RCW and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent with Chapters 43.21C and 82.02 RCW.

16.04.005 Authority, chapter and procedures.

(1) This chapter is established pursuant to RCW 36.70A.060 and Washougal Ordinance No. 1543. This chapter is known as the Washougal critical areas ordinance.

(2) As provided herein, the director is given the authority to interpret and apply, and the responsibility to enforce this chapter to accomplish the stated purpose. The city may withhold, condition, or deny development permits or activity approvals to ensure that the proposed action is consistent with this chapter.

(3) When any provision of this chapter or any existing regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflicts with this chapter, that which provides more protection to the critical areas shall apply.

(4) The director, to the extent practical, shall review development for compliance with critical area regulations with the triggering development application. Where there are no triggering applications, determination of the type of application shall be based upon the criteria in Table 16.04.020(1).

(5) Determinations of compliance with this chapter shall be appealed along with the decision on the underlying permit application to the hearing examiner. (Ord. 1543 § 1, 2006)


16.04.010 Purpose.

The purpose of the critical areas overlay district is to implement the policies of the Washougal Comprehensive Plan. This chapter creates an overlay district that requires the conservation and/or enhancement of identified critical areas while encouraging urban densities and affordable housing through density transfer to nonsensitive (buildable) lands. The Washougal Comprehensive Plan is designed to accommodate a 20-year supply of buildable residential, commercial and industrial lands. Where the effects of this chapter render private property unbuildable, the city will encourage the use of public and private strategies that balance protection or enhancement of critical areas against the city’s adopted development-related comprehensive plan policies.

Critical areas are valuable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints that, in their natural state, provide many valuable social and ecological functions. The attendant buffers of critical areas are essential to the maintenance and protection of the functions and value of important critical areas. The loss of social and ecological functions provided by critical areas, especially wetlands, riparian zones and fish and wildlife habitat, results in a detriment to public safety and welfare.

Critical areas help to relieve the burdens on the people of Washougal which urban development can create including congestion, noise and odors, air pollution, and water quality degradation. Critical areas can filter and clean surface waters, refresh the air we breathe, and provide open space areas that help add variety and texture to the urban landscape.

Critical areas serve several important urban design functions. They provide: (1) open space corridors separating and defining developed areas within the city; (2) views which enhance property values and quality of life in developed neighborhoods; (3) educational opportunities for the citizens of Washougal; and (4) accessible areas for residents to stroll, hike and enjoy Washougal’s valuable natural features.

Conservation of critical areas has associated natural resource benefits, including improved air and water quality, maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat, decreased erosion and sedimentation of streams, absorption of pollutants and preservation of rare plant and animal species.

The intent of this overlay district is, at a minimum, to achieve no net loss of wetlands, floodplains, and fish and wildlife habitat areas and to avoid the degradation or loss of aquifer recharge/wellhead protection areas. Where avoidance is not practical, the intent is to minimize the environmental impacts of development within and adjacent to critical areas. An over-riding objective of this overlay district is to protect or enhance stream corridors and associated wetlands throughout the urban area. This overlay district is also designed to ensure conservation of wetland areas and their functions, where such areas are associated with steep slopes or stream corridors. The overlay district promotes a balance between private property rights, urban level development and public use of critical areas, consistent with the maintenance of their natural appearance and functional values.

Compliance with the Washougal critical areas ordinance may reduce the need to require additional studies to ensure compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), Chapter 43.21C RCW, process and other applicable state or federal environmental regulations. (Ord. 1543 § 1, 2006)


16.04.015 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter the definitions set forth in this chapter and Chapter 18.06 WMC shall apply. Unless specifically defined in this chapter or Chapter 18.06 WMC, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

“Geologically hazardous areas” means areas that, because of their susceptibility to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events, are not suited to the siting of commercial, residential, or industrial development consistent with public health or safety concerns.

“Habitat” means the environment occupied by individuals of a particular species, population or community.

“Headwaters” means springs, lakes, ponds, or wetlands providing significant sources of water to a stream.

“High intensity land use” means roadways, commercial, industrial, and multifamily (more than four units per parcel) land uses.

“Hydric soil” means a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part. Hydric soils that occur in areas having positive indicators of hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology are wetland soils.

(2) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation;

(3) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

(4) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

(5) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments; or

(6) Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures to achieve the identified goal.

“Native,” when referring to plants or plant communities, means those species or communities that are indigenous to the watershed, including extirpated species.

“New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.

“Normal water year” means a 12-month period (October 1st through September 30th) with average precipitation based upon data from the past 50 years.

Obligate wetland plants almost always (99 percent probability) occur in wetlands under natural conditions. Facultative wet plants usually (67 to 99 percent probability) occur in wetlands. Facultative plants are equally likely (34 to 66 percent probability) to occur in wetlands or non-wetlands. Such groupings are more fully defined in the wetlands delineation manual.

“Open water,” when not specifically defined by the rating criteria, means a proportion of open water to vegetative cover equal to 25 percent to 75 percent of the total wetland area during a majority of a normal water year.

“Ordinary high water mark” on all lakes, streams, and tidal water is that mark that will be found by examining the bed and banks and ascertaining where the presence and action of waters are so common and usual, and so long continued in ordinary years, as to mark upon the soil a character distinct from that of the abutting upland in respect to vegetation as that condition exists on June 1, 1971, as it may naturally change thereafter, or as it may change thereafter in accordance with permits issued by a local government or department; provided, that in any area where the ordinary high water line cannot be found, the ordinary high water line adjoining saltwater shall be the line of mean higher high tide and the ordinary high water mark adjoining fresh water shall be line of high water. (RCW 90.58.030(2)(b).)

“Person” means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, organization, cooperative, public or municipal corporation, or any agency of the state or local governmental unit however designated.

“Preservation (protection/maintenance)” means removing a threat to, or preventing the decline of, wetland conditions by an action in or near a wetland. This includes the purchase of land or easements, repairing water control structures or fences, or structural protection such as repairing a barrier island. Preservation does not result in a gain of wetland acres, may result in a gain in functions, and will be used only in exceptional circumstances.

“Priority habitat and species areas,” as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, are areas requiring protective measures for the perpetuation of fish and wildlife species due to their population status, their sensitivity to habitat alteration and/or their recreational, commercial, or tribal importance.

“Qualified wetland professional” generally means a person with at least two years of full-time professional experience and comprehensive training in wetlands issues, including experience performing wetland delineations using state and federal manuals, assessing wetland functions and values, analyzing wetland impacts, preparing wetland reports, developing and implementing mitigation plans, and recommending and designing wetland mitigation projects.

“Regulated activities” include land clearing, grading, placement of fill or waste material, removal of protected native vegetation, construction and other habitat-altering activities.

“Restoration” means the manipulation of physical, chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland. Restoration is divided into the following two classes:

(1) Re-establishment, which is the manipulation of physical, chemical or biological characteristics with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. This results in a net gain of wetland acres.

(2) Rehabilitation, which is the manipulation of physical, chemical or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland. This results in the gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres.

16.04.050 Critical area – Critical aquifer recharge areas.

(1) Purpose. Due to the exceptional susceptibility and/or vulnerability of ground waters underlying aquifer recharge areas to contamination and the importance of such ground waters as sources of public water supply, it is the intent of this section to safeguard ground water resources by mitigating or precluding future discharges of contaminants from new land use activities. The provisions of this section shall apply to regulated activities specified herein within those portions of the Washougal UGA classified as aquifer recharge areas.

(2) Recharging Effect. Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs) are those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water as defined by WAC 365-190-030(2). CARAs have prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates that create a high potential for contamination of ground water resources or contribute significantly to the replenishment of ground water. These areas include the following:

(a) Wellhead Protection Areas (WHPA). Wellhead protection areas may be defined by the boundaries of the 10-year time of ground water travel, or boundaries established using alternate criteria approved by the Clark County department of health in those settings where ground water time of travel is not a reasonable delineation criterion, in accordance with WAC 246-290-135.

(b) Sole Source Aquifers. Sole source aquifers are areas that have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

(c) Susceptible Ground Water Management Areas. Susceptible ground water management areas are areas that have been designated as moderately or highly vulnerable or susceptible in an adopted ground water management program developed pursuant to Chapter 173-100 WAC.

(d) Special Protection Areas. Special protection areas are those areas defined by WAC 173-200-090.

(e) Moderately or Highly Vulnerable Aquifer Recharge Areas. Aquifer recharge areas that are moderately or highly vulnerable to degradation or depletion because of hydrogeologic characteristics are those areas delineated by a hydrogeologic study prepared in accordance with the State Department of Ecology guidelines.

(f) Moderately or Highly Susceptible Aquifer Recharge Areas. Aquifer recharge areas moderately or highly susceptible to degradation or depletion because of hydrogeologic conditions.

16.04.055 Critical area – Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas.

(1) Fish and Wildlife Conservation Areas. The purpose of this section is to protect environmentally distinct, fragile and valuable fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas. Protection measures spelled out in this section are intended to conserve and enhance the functional integrity of those habitats needed to perpetually support fish and wildlife populations. Identified sensitive fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas shall be preserved or adverse impacts mitigated. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas are divided into four basic categories as outlined below:

(a) Riparian.

(i) Overwhelming evidence exists to support the use of riparian buffers of adequate size to maintain healthy, productive fish and wildlife habitat. Although riparian areas comprise only a small portion of the surface landscape, approximately 90 percent of Washington’s land-based vertebrate species prefer, or are dependent upon, riparian habitats for essential life.

(ii) Riparian habitat areas may include frequently flooded areas, critical recharge areas, geologically hazardous areas, and wetlands. Riparian habitat areas are those areas immediately adjacent to waterways that contain elements of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that mutually influence each other. WAC 222-16-031, relating to stream classification, shall be the city’s classification system for streams.

(b) Endangered or Threatened.

(i) Areas that have a primary association with federal-listed endangered, threatened, or sensitive species of fish or wildlife and which if altered may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term. Federal or state-listed species that are endangered, threatened, candidate or of concern found in the Washougal corporate limits and urban growth area as of December 31, 2004, are listed in Appendix A.

(ii) Point source areas are lands where species designated as endangered or threatened have a primary association with that land. Development of such lands shall be controlled in accordance with a site-specific fish and wildlife management plan formulated from WDFWs priority habitats and species management recommendations and prepared by a qualified consultant. The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife should be consulted to provide a technical review and an advisory role in the decision making process. Point locations are the specific sites (nests, dens, etc.) where critical wildlife species are found. Many of these sites have been identified and mapped by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.

(c) Local Habitat Area. Species of local importance are those species that are of local concern due to their population status or their sensitivity to habitat manipulation or that are game species.

(i) Habitats of local importance include a seasonal range or habitat element with which a given species has a primary association, and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term. These might include areas of high relative density or species richness, breeding habitat, winter range, and movement corridors. These might also include habitats that are of limited availability or high vulnerability to alteration, such as cliffs, talus, and wetlands.

(ii) Local habitat areas include those areas specifically identified as local habitat areas on the city’s adopted critical areas map and background maps used to prepare the critical areas map.

(A) The city or private citizens may nominate areas for consideration as local habitat areas and for inclusion on the critical areas map.

(B) The applicant shall be responsible for preparing the nomination using city-prescribed forms. The applicant shall pay a processing fee of one percent of the assessed value of the proposed area as zoned at the time of application.

(C) The hearing examiner, through a Type III process, and in reliance upon all best available science in the hearing record, shall make a determination of whether the nominated area qualifies as a local habitat area.

(d) Priority Habitat Species (PHS) Areas. The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife has identified priority habitats and/or species considered to be priorities for conservation and management. Priority habitat types have unique or significant value to many species. Priority species are those species that require protective measures and/or management guidelines to ensure their perpetuation. The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife has identified PHS areas within the Washougal UGA that if altered may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas include commercial and recreational shellfish; smelt spawning areas; naturally occurring ponds under 20 acres and submerged aquatic beds that provide fish or wildlife habitat; waters of the state; lakes, ponds, streams and rivers planted with game fish by a governmental or tribal entity; and state natural area preserves and natural resource conservation areas. Habitat types and species are listed in Appendix A showing the location of priority species habitats and are kept on file at the city.

(2) Sources. The city consulted the following sources to identify critical fish and wildlife habitat areas:

(a) Water type reference maps, Washington State Department of Natural Resources;

(b) Natural heritage data base, Washington State Department of Natural Resources;

(c) Priority habitats and species program and priority habitat species maps, Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

(d) Non-game data base, Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

(e) Washington rivers information system, Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

(f) Water resource index areas (WRIA), Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife; and

(g) Field studies performed by qualified natural resource specialists.

(3) Education and Information. A voluntary education program to explain the need for and methods of habitat management may provide for long-term protection and enhancement of critical fish and wildlife habitat areas. By informing citizens about the declining populations of several fish and wildlife species in Washougal, the diminishing animal habitat available, and the management techniques that individuals can use to preserve and restore fish and wildlife habitat areas, the city can foster good stewardship of the land by property owners.

(a) The city will provide educational materials and lists of additional sources of information to applicants proposing regulated activities in the vicinity of critical fish and wildlife habitat areas. Materials will be selected from a variety of state and local resources.

(b) The city may accumulate information on the number of proposed activities associated with fish and wildlife habitat areas as identified by this chapter and indicated by state and local governmental maps to be in the vicinity of identified critical fish and wildlife habitats. Information shall include the number of single-family residences and other development occurring in the vicinity of critical fish and wildlife areas. Based on this information, additional regulations could be developed.

(c) The education and information program is an important adjunct to the implementation of the regulatory provisions of this chapter.

(4) Species and Habitat Assessment Report. A critical area report is required where specifically indicated and when an activity is proposed within a critical area or buffer that is not specifically exempt, or permitted with review. Where a critical area report is required it shall be consistent with the following standards:

(a) The report must be completed by a qualified professional.

(b) The critical area report shall use scientifically valid and professionally recognized and accepted methods and studies or best available science in the analysis of critical area data and field reconnaissance and reference the source of science used. The critical area report shall evaluate the proposal and all probable impacts to critical areas in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(c) Minimum Report Contents. At a minimum, the report shall contain the following:

(i) The name and contact information of the applicant, and the name and address of the qualified professional who prepared the report, a description of the proposal, and identification of the permit requested;

(vi) A description of reasonable efforts made to apply mitigation sequencing pursuant to mitigation sequencing, WMC 16.04.085, to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts to critical areas;

(vii) Plans for adequate mitigation, as needed, to offset any impacts, in accordance with mitigation plan requirements, WMC 16.04.085, including, but not limited to:

(A) The impacts of any proposed development within or adjacent to a critical area or buffer on the critical area; and

(B) The impacts of any proposed alteration of a critical area or buffer on the development proposal, other properties and the environment;

(viii) A discussion of the performance standards applicable to the critical area and proposed activity;

(ix) Financial guarantees to ensure compliance; and

(x) Any additional information required for the critical area as specified in the corresponding chapter.

(d) Unless otherwise provided, a critical area report may be supplemented by or composed of, in whole or in part, any reports or studies required by other laws and regulations or previously prepared, by a qualified professional, for and applicable to the development proposal site, as approved by the director.

(e) The director may waive specific requirements of the critical area reports where less information is required to adequately address the impacts to the critical area or where existing information is on file with the city that addresses the impacts.

(f) The director may require additional information that is necessary to determine compliance with the standards of this chapter.

(g) A qualified professional shall be a person who has the education, training, experience, and/or certification that meets the specific requirements to evaluate fish and wildlife habitat.

(5) Best Available Science. Habitat reports and decisions to alter habitat areas shall rely on the best available science to protect the functions and values of critical habitat areas and must give special consideration to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance anadromous fish and their habitat. Best available science is that scientific information applicable to the critical area prepared by local, state or federal natural resource agencies, a qualified scientific professional or team of qualified scientific professionals, that is consistent with criteria established in WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925.

(6) Habitat Buffers. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas and buffers are assigned to the lands regulated by this section according to Table 16.04.055(6)(a). Development activities are restricted within buffer areas as indicated in Table 16.04.055(6)(b).

(7) Buffer Standards.

(a) Building Setback and Construction near Buffer. A minimum setback of 15 feet from the buffer shall be required for construction of any impervious surface(s) greater than 120 square feet of base coverage from the head or toe of a slope where the overall slope is greater than 35 percent. Clearing, grading, and filling within 15 feet of the buffer setback shall be allowed only when the applicant can demonstrate that native vegetation within the buffer will not be damaged. The additional impervious surface setback from the toe and head of a slope may be waived if the applicant demonstrates, by credible evidence, that the proposed impervious surface will not significantly affect the stability of the slope.

(b) Marking of the Buffer Area. The edge of the buffer area shall be clearly staked, flagged, and fenced prior to and through completion of construction. The buffer boundary markers shall be clearly visible, durable, and permanently affixed to the ground.

(c) Fencing from Farm Animals. Permanent fencing shall be required from the buffer when farm animals are introduced on a site.

(8) Riparian Area Ecosystem Buffers. Regulated activities proposed along rivers and streams shall provide for habitat protection.

(a) The riparian ecosystem buffer is generally an area of no building, consisting of undisturbed natural vegetation. The buffer shall be required along all streams as classified by the DNR water typing classification system (WAC 222-16-030). The buffer shall extend landward from the ordinary high water mark of the water body.

(b) The buffer of a river or stream shall not extend landward beyond an existing substantial improvement such as an improved road, dike, levee, or a permanent structure which reduces the impact proposed activities would have on the river or stream.

(c) The city identifies the following river and stream segments as being critical to anadromous fish and, therefore, requiring a larger buffer protection:

(i) Columbia and Washougal Rivers within the UGA;

(ii) Gibbons Creek within the UGA; and

(iii) Campen Creek from north of J Street within Orchard Hills Golf Course to its confluence with Gibbons.

(9) Mitigation.

(a) Approval. City approval of a mitigation plan is a prerequisite for approval of any development activities within a designated habitat area or habitat buffer.

(c) The city shall consult with state and federal resource management agencies and, in order to protect wildlife habitat or natural resource values, shall attach such conditions as may be necessary to effectively mitigate identified adverse impacts of the proposed development activity.

(d) The city may request third party “peer review” of an application by qualified professionals and may incorporate recommendations from such third party reports in findings approving or denying the application.

(e) All reports recommending mitigation shall include provisions for monitoring of programs and replacement of improvements, on an annual basis, consistent with report recommendations and at one-, three-, five-, seven- and 10-year intervals.

(f) The city may require replacement mitigation to be established and functional concurrent with project construction.

(10) No Net Loss.

(a) Mitigation efforts, when allowed, shall ensure that development activity does not yield a net loss of the area or function, including fish and wildlife habitat values, of the critical area. No net loss shall be measured by:

(i) Avoidance or mitigation of adverse impacts to fish or wildlife; or

(ii) Avoidance or mitigation of net loss of habitat functions necessary to sustain fish life; or

(iii) Avoidance or mitigation of loss of area by habitat type.

(b) Mitigation to achieve no net loss should benefit those organisms being impacted.

(c) Where development results in a loss of habitat area, the mitigation plan shall demonstrate that habitat area is replaced at an equal or greater functional value(s).

(i) Wherever possible, replacement or enhancement shall occur on-site.

(ii) However, where the applicant can demonstrate that off-site mitigation will provide greater functional values, the city may approve such off-site mitigation.

16.04.060 Critical area – Frequently flooded areas.

(1) Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for Clark County Washington and Incorporated Areas” dated September 5, 2012, with accompanying flood insurance maps (FIRM), and any revisions thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The flood insurance study is on file at the office of the director, 1701 C. St., Washougal, WA. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in subsection (15) of this section shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued which incorporates the data used under subsection (15) of this section.

(2) Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

(3) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. Where this chapter and another code, ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, that which imposes the more stringent restriction shall prevail.

(4) Interpretation.

(a) In the interpretation and application of this section, all provisions shall be:

(i) Considered as minimum requirements;

(ii) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(iii) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(b) Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. The local administrator, the governing body or its agent or employee may interpret and apply when necessary the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. Any aggrieved person may contest the location of the boundary and shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation to the local administrator and then the governing body. Such appeal shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of the Rules and Regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR Parts 59 through 76).

(5) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes, and is based upon scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of Washougal, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

(6) Floodplain (FP) Combining District. A floodplain (FP) combining district is established and shall be applied to all 100-year floodplains identified on the flood insurance rate maps, which have been adopted by reference. The land use and siting provisions of these areas shall be in addition to other zoning provisions applied. Two distinct areas are recognized within the FP combining district: the “floodway” area and the “floodway fringe” area.

(7) Regulatory Area. The areas for floodplain management regulations shall be those areas subject to a base (100-year) flood. Base floodplains are designated as special flood hazard areas on the most recent maps provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the National Flood Insurance Program.

(8) Relationship to Other Requirements. Land uses in the floodplain combining district shall be subject to all relevant local, state, or federal regulations including those of the underlying zoning district. Where applicable, permit requirements under the Shoreline Management Act (Chapter 90.58 RCW), or the State Flood Control Zone Act (Chapter 86.16 RCW) may be substituted for permits required under this chapter; provided, that the standards of this chapter are applied.

(9) Criteria for Land Management and Use. The standards and definitions contained in 44 CFR Parts 59 and 60 for the National Flood Insurance Program are adopted by reference as the minimum standards.

(10) Uses Prohibited in the Floodway. Structures for human habitation and other residential structures or works posing a high flood damage potential are prohibited in the floodway, unless authorized by WAC 173-158-070. Any use in a floodway shall be subject to the terms of a floodplain permit.

(11) Uses Allowed under a Floodplain Permit. All other uses permitted in the zoning district with which the FP combining district has been combined are allowed in the floodway and floodway fringe areas subject to the terms of a floodplain permit.

(12) Permit Requirements. A floodplain permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard. The permit shall be for all structures including manufactured homes and other development, including fill and other activities, also set forth in the definitions. Permit application forms shall be furnished by the city clerk/treasurer. The application shall include, but is not limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevations of the area in question, and existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, and drainage facilities. Specifically, the following information is required:

(a) Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all nonresidential structures;

(b) Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed;

(c) Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing requirements; and

(d) Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.

(13) Designation of the Local Administrator. The city manager or his or her designee is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain permit applications in accordance with its provisions.

(14) Duties and Responsibilities of the Local Administrator. Duties of the local administrator, if applicable, shall include, but not be limited to:

(a) Development Review.

(i) Review all proposed developments to determine whether or not a floodplain permit is required.

(ii) Review all proposed developments with respect to the flood insurance study maps and zoning district boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of special flood hazard area boundaries.

(b) Permit Review.

(i) Review all proposed development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.

(ii) Review all proposed development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.

(iii) Review all proposed development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions are met.

(15) Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, the city manager or his or her designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from an agency of federal or state government, or other sources, in order to administer this section, including specific standards for residential construction, nonresidential construction and floodways and floodway requirements.

(16) Information to Be Obtained and Maintained.

(a) Where base flood elevation data is provided through the flood insurance study or required as in subsection (15) of this section, obtain and record the actual as-built elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.

(b) For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures, where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or as required in subsection (15) of this section:

(i) Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been floodproofed;

(ii) Maintain the floodproofing certifications;

(c) Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

(17) Variance Procedure – Additional State Requirements. The variance procedure contained in 44 CFR Part 60.6 and this chapter shall apply to the additional state requirements contained in WAC 173-158-064 and 173-158-070, unless an activity or use is expressly prohibited therein.

(18) Appeal and Review of City Action.

(a) Any aggrieved person may appeal the approval or denial of a floodplain permit to the hearing examiner.

(b) In acting on appeals or permit approval requests, the city shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

(i) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

(ii) The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

(iii) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

(iv) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

(v) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable;

(vi) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

(vii) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

(viii) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

(ix) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

(x) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters, and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

(xi) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems, streets and bridges.

(c) Upon consideration of the above factors, and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal hearing body may attach such conditions to actions on appeals and approvals as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter.

(d) The director shall maintain the records of all appeal and approval actions of the city of Washougal.

(e) Conditions for Variances. Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

(f) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places.

(g) Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(h) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

(i) Variances shall only be issued upon:

(i) Showing a good and sufficient cause;

(ii) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant;

(iii) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

(j) Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations shall be quite rare.

(k) Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except subsection (18)(e) of this section, and otherwise complies with anchoring and construction materials and methods general standards below.

(l) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

(m) Penalties and Enforcement.

(i) The attorney general or the attorney for the local government shall bring such injunctive, declaratory, or other actions as are necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

(ii) Any person who fails to comply with this chapter shall also be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation. Each violation or each day of noncompliance shall constitute a separate violation.

(iii) The penalty provided for in this section shall be imposed by a notice in writing either by certified mail with return receipt requested or by personal service to the person incurring the same from the department or local government, describing the violation with reasonable particularity and ordering the act or acts constituting the violation or violations to cease and desist or, in appropriate cases, requiring necessary corrective action to be taken within a specific and reasonable time.

(iv) Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section by the department shall be subject to review by the pollution control hearings board. Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section by the city shall be subject to review by the city council. Any penalty jointly imposed by the department and city shall be appealed to the pollution control hearings board.

(19) General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

(a) Anchoring.

(i) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.

(ii) All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors (reference FEMA’s “Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas” guidebook for additional techniques).

(b) Construction Materials and Methods.

(i) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.

(ii) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.

(iii) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

(20) Utilities.

(a) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;

(b) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters;

(c) On-site waste disposal systems are prohibited in the floodplain; and

(d) Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway.

(21) Subdivision Proposals.

(a) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;

(b) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;

(c) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and

(d) Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).

(22) Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study, FIRM or from another authoritative source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

(23) Additional Standards.

(a) Critical Facilities.

(i) Critical facilities should be afforded additional flood protection due to their nature. The city shall use the 500-year frequency flood as a minimum standard instead of the 100-year frequency flood as used for other types of development. When FEMA amends the Washougal floodway and floodplain maps the city shall reevaluate this section within one year of the FEMA map amendments.

(ii) Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the 500-year floodplain as identified on the city’s FIRM. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the 500-year frequency floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the 500-year frequency floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the level of the 500-year frequency flood or the flood protection elevation, whichever is greater. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into flood waters.

(iii) Access routes elevated to or above the level of the 500-year frequency flood shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.

(b) Flood Protection Elevation. In order to account for the impacts of future development on flood depths, and in order to ensure less expensive insurance rates for floodplain occupants, all development within special flood hazard areas which requires elevation or floodproofing shall be elevated or floodproofed to the flood protection elevation (base flood elevation plus one foot).

(24) Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, or subsection (15) of this section, Use of Other Base Flood Data, the following provisions are required:

(a) Residential Construction.

(i) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation.

(ii) Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(A) A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

(B) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

(C) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood waters.

Note: Foundation vent standards required by the IBC/IRC outside the floodplain do not meet this standard and are often inadvertently permitted. Insurance rates reflect an “all or nothing” standard, meaning partially ventilated crawl spaces may be subject to an additional loading fee of 20 to 25 percent attached to the annual insurance premium.

(b) Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

(i) Be floodproofed so that below one foot or more above the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

(ii) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

(iii) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official;

(iv) Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in this subsection; and

(v) Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to one foot above the base flood level will be rated at the base flood elevation).

(25) Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zone AE shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is one foot or more above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.

(26) Recreational Vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites are required either to:

(a) Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

(b) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

(c) Meet the requirements for a manufactured home and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes. Recreational vehicles may be allowed in the floodway and floodway fringe areas on a temporary basis as long as subsections (26)(a) and (b) of this section apply.

(27) Floodways and Floodway Requirements. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection (1) of this section are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

(a) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;

(b) Construction or reconstruction of residential structures, including the placement of any manufactured homes, is prohibited within the designated floodways, except for:

(i) Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

(ii) Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

(A) Before the repair or reconstruction is started, or

(B) If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred.

(iii) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as historic places, may be excluded in the 50 percent determination.

(c) If subsection (27)(a) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this code.

(28) Special Flood Hazard Areas with Base Flood Elevations but without Designated Floodways. When a regulatory floodway for a stream has not been designated, the city will require that applicants for new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) reasonably utilize the best available information from federal, state, or other sources to demonstrate the cumulative effect of existing, proposed, and anticipated future development and determine that the increase in the water surface elevations of the base flood will not be more than one foot at any point in the community. Building and development within a SFHA without a designated floodway shall comply with the requirement of 44 CFR 60.3(b) and 60.3(c) of the NFIP regulations, adopted by reference.

(29) Alteration of Watercourses.

(a) Notify adjacent communities and the Washington State Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency;

(b) Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

(30) Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. (Ord. 1921 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 1728 § 2 (Exh. A), 2012; Ord. 1725 § 4 (Exh. B), 2012; Ord. 1543 § 1, 2006)


16.04.065 Critical area – Geologically hazardous areas.

(1) Purpose and Intent.

(a) The purpose of this chapter is to regulate development to protect fragile steep slopes from unsuitable development and to protect life and property from hazards due to inappropriate development on steep slopes, erodible soils and geologically hazardous areas, in a manner consistent with the Washougal Comprehensive Plan and Clark County countywide planning policies.

(b) It shall also be the intent of these regulations to: use the fullest current understanding of good civic design, landscape architecture, architecture, planning and civil engineering to preserve, enhance and promote the existing and future appearance and resources of hillside areas; preserve and enhance the beauty of the landscape by encouraging the maximum retention of natural topographic features, such as forested hillsides, drainage swales, streams, slopes, ridge lines, vistas and natural plant formations; promote a safe means of ingress and egress for vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and within hillside areas while at the same time minimizing the scarring effects of hillside street construction; and encourage imaginative and innovative building techniques to create buildings suited to natural hillside surroundings. 

(c) Unauthorized motor vehicle use in geologically hazardous areas may be construed as a violation of this chapter and the community development director may refer observed unauthorized motorized vehicle use to the Washougal code enforcement officer or person designated to fulfill code enforcement activity within the city.

(2) Applicability. This chapter shall apply to any development proposal for properties when any topographical slope exceeds 15 percent or where adverse conditions associated with slope stability, erosion, sedimentation, or geological hazard are present as determined by Clark County or city records or identified by a geotechnical engineer.

(3) Approval Criteria for Hillside Development. All development proposals shall comply with the following:

(a) Orient development on the site so that grading and site preparation is kept to a minimum;

(b) Grade the site to blend with natural landforms to minimize the necessity of padding and/or terracing of building sites;

(c) Phase the project into workable units to schedule construction to minimize soil disturbance and to control erosion in accordance with the approved erosion control and grading plan;

(d) Allocation for open spaces and recreational uses of areas not well suited for development because of soil, geology, vegetation or hydrology limitations;

(e) Existing native vegetation shall not be removed in areas of 15 percent or greater slopes. Non-native, invasive nuisance vegetation may be removed by hand (not by chemical methods or machinery such as backhoe, track vehicle, or similar equipment). The exception is in the case where approval has been granted by the hearing examiner or community development director for utilities, storm water facilities, buildings, roads, and filled areas;

(f) Inclusion of innovative concepts for slope and soil stabilization, grading and landscaping is encouraged.

(4) Engineering Reports and Plans Required. At the time of preliminary plat review for development, or at the time of site plan review, of properties with slopes of 15 percent or more, the following reports and plans shall be submitted for review:

(a) Engineering Soils Report. This report shall include conclusions and recommendations regarding soil conditions for proposed developments. It shall include site-specific soil tests, particularly to identify the boundaries of slope-constrained areas and whether soils are permeable for storm water infiltration and construction of streets, utilities and buildings. This report shall be completed by a registered professional engineer experienced in soil mechanics. The report may use the U.S. Soil Conservation Service’s local soil survey as its basis, although site-specific soil tests are strongly recommended;

(b) Engineering Geology Report. This report shall include a complete description of the geology of the site, conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed development and opinions and recommendations covering the capability of the site to be developed for its intended use or uses. This report shall be completed by a professional geologist or a professional engineer experienced and knowledgeable in the practice of engineering geology;

(c) Hydrology Report. This report shall include a complete description of the hydrology of the site, conclusions and recommendations regarding the effect of hydrologic conditions on the proposed development and the capability of the site to be developed. Preliminary hydrology reports shall be completed by a professional engineer experienced and knowledgeable in the practice of hydrology and in the techniques of hydrologic investigation;

(d) Grading and Drainage Plan. A plan shall be submitted which contains the following information: existing topographic contour intervals of not less than two feet, proposed building sites; approximate dimensions, elevations and contours of proposed grading, including all cut and fill slopes; and proposed drainage facilities including all surface and subsurface drainage devices, retaining walls, sediment basins and other drainage features;

(e) Revegetation Plan. A revegetation plan showing types of vegetative materials to be planted in disturbed and graded areas or in areas where nuisance vegetation is proposed to be removed;

(f) The city will review the reports and plans within the context of the approval criteria for development specified in subsection (3) of this section and may place conditions on the proposed development that will result in compliance with said general guidelines.

(5) Hillside Development Grading Regulations. All development subject to regulation under this chapter shall conform to the following:

(a) In addition to the erosion control requirements of the city of Washougal engineering standards, no earthwork activity shall occur on slopes in excess of 25 percent between the dates of October 1st and May 1st; provided, that the city of Washougal may extend or shorten this time period on a case-by-case basis depending on actual weather conditions.

(b) Buffer area of at least 50 feet shall be established from the edge of areas characterized by steep slopes (25 percent or greater), potentially unstable soils, and erosion potential, or seismic activity. The buffer may be extended at the determination of the community development director or hearing examiner if a larger buffer is necessary to mitigate adverse impacts and to protect life and property. Existing native vegetation within the buffer area shall be maintained. The buffer may be reduced if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the community development director that such reduction will adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare.

(c) No grading, filling, clearing or excavation of any kind in excess of 50 cubic yards shall be initiated until a grading plan is formally reviewed and approved by the city engineer. Additional geotechnical analysis may be required, as determined by the city engineer.

(d) Borrowing for fill shall be prohibited unless the material is obtained from a cut permitted under an approved grading plan or imported from outside the hillside areas of Washougal. No cuts shall be permitted solely for the purpose of obtaining fill unless specifically approved in the grading plan, and any approved cut or fill slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal to one vertical (2:1) unless it can be shown by the project engineer that steeper slopes are feasible.

(e) All retaining walls with a total vertical projection of more than four feet shall be engineered as structural members keyed into stable foundations and capable of sustaining the design loads, and approved by the building official through the building permit process.

(f) All slopes which are stabilized by mechanical or alternate means shall be adapted to conform to the surrounding terrain.

(g) Construction shall be scheduled to minimize soil disturbance. All disturbed soil surfaces shall be stabilized. Temporary treatment adequate to prevent erosion shall be installed on these surfaces.

(6) Hillside Development Road and Circulation Requirements.

(a) Roads shall be designed to create the minimum feasible amounts of land coverage and the minimum feasible disturbance of the soil. Existing vegetation of the deep-rooted perennial variety shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible in the location of roads. Road alignments should follow the natural terrain unless the project engineer can justify additional cuts or fills.

(b) Combinations of collective private driveways, cluster parking areas and on-street parallel parking bays shall be used where possible to attempt to optimize the objectives of minimum soil disturbance, minimum impervious cover, excellence of design and aesthetic sensitivity. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1543 § 1, 2006)


16.04.070 Critical area – Wetlands.

(1) Purpose. Wetlands constitute important natural resources which provide significant environmental functions including: the control of flood waters, maintenance of summer stream flows, filtration of pollutants, recharge of ground water, and provisions of significant habitat areas for fish and wildlife. Uncontrolled urban-density development in and adjacent to wetlands can eliminate or significantly reduce the ability of wetlands to provide these important functions, thereby detrimentally affecting the public health, safety, and general welfare.

(2) Applicability. The provisions of this chapter apply to any soil disturbance occurring or land use proposal affecting Category 1, 2, 3, or 4 wetlands or associated buffers unless otherwise expressly exempted by this chapter.

(3) Exempted Wetlands. This chapter shall not apply to the following wetlands:

(a) Isolated wetlands less than one-tenth of an acre in size and scoring less than 20 points under the Department of Ecology Rating System, as amended.

(b) Riparian. Wetlands less than five feet wide above the ordinary high water mark along streams and lakes which are regulated under the State Shorelines Management Act.

(4) Interpretation. Except where a contrary intent clearly appears, the provisions of this chapter shall be construed to the maximum feasible extent consistent with the Federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC Section 1251 et seq., and the rules and guidelines promulgated pursuant thereto. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude application of the State Environmental Policy Act in approving applications not listed in WMC 16.04.025.

(5) Wetland Delineation and Marking.

(a) An application shall not be deemed technically complete until completion (if required) of a wetland delineation.

(b) The community development director shall determine whether a wetland delineation is required based upon several factors including but not limited to a site visit, review of existing critical areas maps, review of National Wetland Inventory maps, the presence of hydric soils, historical evidence, or consultation with a qualified expert.

(c) Wetland Delineation.

(i) Methodology. The location of a wetland and its boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation, to be performed by a qualified wetland professional using the methodology contained in the Washington State Wetland Identification and Delineation Manual (Publication #96-94) and 1987 U.S. Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual or the most current editions adopted by these agencies. The applicant shall be responsible for the cost of the professional services. If a wetland is located on an adjacent parcel, such that the wetland buffer may extend onto the proposed development site, the applicant shall use all reasonable resources to determine the wetland boundary and category and buffer type.

(ii) Information Requirements. Wetland boundaries shall be staked and flagged in the field and a delineation report shall be submitted to the city. The report shall include the following information:

(A) U.S.G.S. topographic map with site clearly defined;

(B) National wetland inventory map showing site;

(C) Soil Conservation Service soils map of the site;

(D) Site map, at a scale no smaller than one inch equals 400 feet, if practical, showing the following information:

1. Wetland boundaries;

2. Sample sites and sample transects;

3. Boundaries of forested areas;

4. Boundaries of wetland classes if multiple classes exist;

(E) An aerial photograph of the project area (scale no smaller than one inch equals 400 feet);

(F) Discussion of methods and results with special emphasis on technique used from the wetlands delineation manual;

(G) Acreage of each wetland identified on the site based on a survey;

(H) All completed field data sheets (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ format for three parameter application) numbered to correspond to each sample site; and

(I) Name and contact information of the applicant and primary author(s) of the wetland critical area report.

(iii) Responsibility. The wetland delineation is the responsibility of the applicant. The city shall review the boundary delineation and may request third party “peer review” of the delineation by qualified professionals and may incorporate recommendations from such third party reports in findings approving or denying the application. If the delineation is found to not accurately reflect the boundary of the wetland, the city will issue a report citing evidence (for example, soil samples) that demonstrates where the delineation is in error. The applicant may then either revise the delineation or submit another report or appeal.

(iv) Buffers. All buffers shall be measured perpendicularly outward from the delineated wetland boundary or, in the case of a stream with no adjacent wetlands, the ordinary high water mark as surveyed in the field.

(v) Marking Buffer During Construction. The location of the outer extent of the wetland buffer shall be marked in the field and such markings shall be maintained throughout the duration of the permit.

(vi) Permanent Marking of Buffer Area. A permanent physical demarcation along the upland boundary of the wetland buffer area shall be installed and thereafter maintained. Such demarcation may consist of logs, a tree or hedge row, fencing, or other prominent physical marking approved by the hearing examiner. In addition, signs (minimum size one-foot by one-foot and posted three and one-half feet above grade) shall be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 100 feet, whichever is less, and perpetually maintained at locations along the outer perimeter of the wetland buffer worded substantially as follows: WETLAND AND BUFFER – PLEASE RETAIN IN A NATURAL STATE.

(vii) A conservation covenant shall be recorded in a form approved by the city attorney as adequate to incorporate the other restrictions of this section and to give notice of the requirement to obtain a wetland permit prior to engaging in regulated activities within a wetland or its buffer.

(viii) In the cases of plats, short plats, and recorded site plans, include on the face of such instrument the boundary of the wetland and its buffer and a reference to the separately recorded conservation covenant provided for in subsection (5)(c) of this subsection.

(6) Wetland Rating. Wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington State Department of Ecology’s Wetland Rating System for Western Washington (Ecology Publication #04-06-025) or as revised by Ecology. The rating system is designed to differentiate between wetlands based on their sensitivity to disturbance, their significance, rarity, the ability for replacement, and wetland functions. This rating system shall be used to determine base buffer widths and to determine mitigation and enhancement requirements. The rating system document contains the definitions and methods for determining the criteria for each wetland category. Wetland rating forms shall be included in the wetland delineation report.

(a) The determination of the specific category of wetland and buffer type for each wetland shall be the responsibility of the city.

(b) A single wetland shall be classified into more than one category if distinct areas exist in the wetland that clearly meet the description of separate categories. Buffers shall also be classified into more than one type when distinct areas exist in the buffer that clearly meet the description for separate types.

(c) Wetlands that are enhanced and thereafter meet the criteria for a higher category are classified according to the characteristics of the pre-enhanced wetland.

(d) Wetland Rating System. The rating system contains a general description of each wetland category followed by specific criteria. If the specific criteria conflicts with the general description, the city shall determine the most appropriate classification as applied to a particular site.

(e) Wetland Rating Categories.

(i) Category I. Category I wetlands represent a unique or rare wetland type; are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or provide a high level of water quality, hydrologic and habitat functions. These wetlands meet one or more of the following criteria:

(A) Wetlands that are identified by scientists of the Washington State Department of Natural Resources Washington Natural Heritage Program as high quality wetlands, relatively undisturbed wetlands or wetlands that support state-listed threatened or endangered plants;

(B) Bogs due to their sensitivity to disturbance and that they are irreplaceable through compensatory mitigation;

(C) Mature (softwoods 80 years old or older and hardwoods 50 years old or older) and old growth forested wetlands larger than one acre;

(D) Wetlands that perform many functions well, as indicated by scoring 70 points (out of 100) in the rating system.

(ii) Category II. Category II wetlands are difficult but not impossible to replace, and perform most functions relatively well or perform one group of functions (water quality, hydrologic or habitat) very well and the other two groups moderately well. These wetlands have moderately high level of functions, as indicated by scoring 51 to 69 points in the Ecology rating system.

(iii) Category III. Category III wetlands perform a moderate level of functions; typically have been disturbed in some manner; and are often less diverse and more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. These wetlands score between 30 and 50 points in the Ecology rating system.

(iv) Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions and are often heavily disturbed. These wetlands score less than 30 points in the Ecology rating system.

(7) Base Buffer Width.

(a) Buffer width, measured in feet, shall be based upon “Alternative 3 in Appendix 8C of Freshwater Wetlands in Washington State, Vol. 2”. Intensity of use shall be based upon Table “8C-3, Types of proposed land use that can result in high, moderate, and low levels of impacts to adjacent wetlands” described in “Appendix 8C of Freshwater Wetlands in Washington State, Vol. 2”, and attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.

(e) General Site Design Measures. High intensity buffers may be reduced to moderate intensity buffers if all of the following mitigation measures are applied to the greatest extent practicable:

(i) Buffer Enhancement. The intent and effect of an approved buffer enhancement program shall be to measurably improve low functioning buffers by increasing the identified functions of the buffer. This may include the removal and management of noxious weeds and/or invasive vegetation or specific measures to improve hydrologic or habitat function.

(ii) Shielding of High Intensity Uses.

(A) Lights. Direct all lights away from wetlands;

(B) Noise. Locate activity that generates noise away from wetlands;

(C) Pets and Human Disturbance. Use privacy fencing; plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion; place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract.

(iii) Surface Water Management.

(A) Existing Runoff. Retrofit storm water detention and treatment for roads and existing development and disperse direct discharge of channelized flows from lawns and landscaping;

(B) Change in Water Regime. Infiltrate and/or disperse storm water runoff from impervious surfaces and drainage from lawns and landscaping into the buffer at multiple locations, except where the infiltration or dispersal would either be in opposition to the recommendations contained in the geotechnical report for the project or where the infiltration or dispersal would occur in a geologically hazardous area.

(f) Low Impact Development. If the development of the site has a low impact upon the critical area, the applicant may reduce the buffer width. However, the following reductions cannot be used in combination:

(i) Limiting Effective Impervious Surface as Defined in the Washougal Engineering Standards. Use of low impact development techniques and/or limiting the extent of impervious site area. Areas set aside as non-impervious surface must be protected by some type of permanent legal protection such as a covenant or easement.

(A) Less than 35 percent effective impervious surface results in a low-intensity impact.

(B) Less than 50 percent effective impervious surface results in a moderate-intensity impact.

(ii) Habitat Corridors. Establishment of a minimum 100-foot-wide functioning or enhanced vegetated corridor between the wetland and any other priority habitat areas as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife:

(A) Applies only to wetlands with habitat function scores higher than 20 on the rating system form;

(B) The habitat corridor must be protected for the entire distance between the wetland and the priority habitat area by some type of permanent legal protection such as a covenant or easement.

(9) Wetland Permit Standards – General.

(a) Any development proposal that impacts a wetland or wetland buffer shall not be allowed without an approved mitigation or enhancement plan consistent with subsection H of this section and WMC 16.04.085 and the mitigation sequencing preference.

(c) Density transfer credits shall be calculated on the total acreage of protected critical areas and buffers. In no case shall the site as a whole, including buildable and unbuildable lands, exceed the maximum density.

(4) Site Development. Development within the property utilizing density transfer may reduce the minimum lot size and minimum lot width dimensions for the zone by up to 10 percent in order to accommodate the additional lots transferred. Any further reduction to lot width only that is greater than 10 percent shall be processed as a variance consistent with Chapter 18.80 WMC.

(5) Requirements.

16.16.010 Purpose and policy.

The purpose of this chapter is to implement the Washington Shoreline Management Act of 1971 and the Washougal shorelines management master program as endorsed by the city council on June 17, 1974, by regulating use activities on shorelines of the city and by providing for variances as may be warranted.

The Washington State Legislature has found that the shorelines of the state are among the most valuable and fragile of its natural resources and that there is great concern throughout the state relating to their utilization, protection, restoration and preservation. In addition, it has found that ever increasing pressures of additional uses are being placed on the shorelines, necessitating increased coordination in the management and development of the shorelines of the state. The legislature further found that much of the shorelines of the state and the uplands adjacent thereto are in private ownership; that unrestricted construction on the privately owned or publicly owned shorelines of the state is not in the best public interest; and therefore, coordinated planning is necessary in order to protect the public interest associated with the shorelines of the state while, at the same time, recognizing and protecting private property rights consistent with the public interest. There is, therefore, a clear and urgent demand for a planned, rational, and concerted effort, jointly performed by federal, state and local governments, to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the state’s shorelines.

It is the policy of the state as stated in said legislation to provide for the management of the shorelines of the state by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses. This policy is designed to ensure the development of these shorelines in a manner which, while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in the navigable water, will promote and enhance the public interest. This policy contemplates protecting against adverse effects to the public health, the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the waters of the state and their aquatic life, while protecting generally public rights of navigation and corollary rights incidental thereto.

The State Legislature has further declared that the interest of all of the people shall be paramount in the management of shorelines of statewide significance. The Washington Department of Ecology, in adopting guidelines for shorelines of statewide significance, and local government, in developing master programs for shorelines of statewide significance, are required to and shall give preference to uses in the following order of preference which:

(1) Recognize and protect the state-wide interest over local interest;

(2) Preserve the natural character of the shoreline;

(3) Result in long-term over short-term benefits;

(4) Protect the resources and ecology of the shoreline;

(5) Increase public access to publicly owned areas of the shorelines;

(6) Increase recreational opportunities for the public in the shoreline;

(7) Provide for any other element as defined in Section 10(2) of the Shoreline Management Act of 1971 deemed appropriate or necessary.

It is stated that the city’s policy is consistent with such state policy as above stated. In the implementation of this policy, the public’s opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the city shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state, the city, and the people generally.

To this end, uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment, or are unique to or dependent upon use of the city’s shoreline. Alterations of the natural condition of the shorelines of the city, in those limited instances when authorized, shall be given priority for single-family residences, ports, shoreline recreational uses including but not limited to parks, marinas, piers and other improvements facilitating public access to shorelines of the city, industrial and commercial developments which are particularly dependent on their location on or use of the shorelines of the city and other development that will provide an opportunity for substantial numbers of the people to enjoy the shorelines of the city.

Permitted uses in the shorelines of the city shall be designed and conducted in a manner to minimize, insofar as practical, any resultant damage to the ecology and environment of the shoreline area and any interference with the public’s use of the water. (Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.020 Applicability.

This chapter shall apply to all developments and substantial developments, as defined in this title, proposed upon shorelines of the city, as defined in this title. No development or substantial development shall be undertaken on the shorelines of the city except those which are consistent with the policy of this chapter, the applicable regulations, and provisions of the master program, except as specifically authorized through a variance process.

No person shall undertake any substantial development, as defined by this title, on the shorelines of the city without first applying to the community development director for a substantial development permit and obtaining approval of such substantial development permit in accordance with the procedures, or reference thereto, specified in this chapter. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.030 Shoreline review committee.

A shorelines management review committee is created, consisting of the community development director (chair), one member of the city council, and one member of the planning commission. The committee is charged with determining if a shoreline substantial development permit application is significant or nonsignificant and hence determine the process which it will go through. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.040 Procedures.

(1) Except as provided for in subsection (3) of this section, shoreline substantial development permits, conditional uses or variances shall be processed as a Type II land use action, as provided for in WMC 18.94.060.

(2) Preapplication Review. Unless waived by the director, all shoreline substantial development permits, conditional uses and variances shall be subject to a preapplication conference pursuant to WMC 18.94.045.

(3) Supplemental Procedures. To assure consistency with the Shoreline Management Act (Chapter 173-27 WAC), the following supplemental procedures shall be in addition, or supercedent to, those procedures set forth in Chapter 18.94 WMC for shoreline substantial development permits.

(a) The public comment period from the notice of application shall be no less than 30 days.

(b) Upon receipt of a technically complete substantial development permit application, the director shall immediately forward a copy of the application to the shoreline review committee. After the end of the initial public comment period, but prior to issuance of the SEPA threshold determination, the committee, based upon the criteria in subsections (3)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, shall determine if the substantial development permit is significant or nonsignificant.

(i) Determination of Significance. Generally, a determination of significance is based upon the nature and scope of the project, with the public interest in mind. If the development is likely to involve public concern (for instance, as manifested in public comments received during the 30-day period of comment opportunity), the application will be determined a significant substantial shoreline development proposal. If the committee determines the application to be significant, the committee shall review and make recommendations on the application, and the director shall schedule the matter for consideration by the hearing examiner and proceed with the application as a Type III land use action.

(ii) Determination of Nonsignificance. If the applicant is not determined to be significant, the director shall proceed with application processing as a Type II land use action. The final decision on the permit application shall be issued within 60 days of the technically complete date. 

A determination of significance or nonsignificance of a shoreline substantial development permit shall not bind the city to issuing a SEPA determination of significance or nonsignificance on the same application. A final decision shall be issued within 90 days of the technically complete date.

(c) Upon final decision by the city, and exhaustion of all local appeals of such decision or lapse of local appeal opportunities, the city shall forward a copy of the decision to the Department of Ecology. When a substantial development permit and a conditional use or variance permit are required for a development, the submittal on the permits shall be made concurrently. The submittal to the Department of Ecology shall include the following information:

(i) A copy of the complete application pursuant to WAC 173-27-180;

(ii) Findings and conclusions that establish the basis for the decision including but not limited to identification of shoreline environment designation, applicable master program policies and regulations and the consistency of the project with appropriate review criteria for the type of permit(s) as established in WAC 173-27-140 through 173-27-170;

(iii) The final decision of the local government;

(iv) The permit data sheet required by WAC 173-27-190; 

(v) Where applicable, local government shall also file the applicable documents required by Chapter 43.21C RCW, the State Environmental Policy Act, or in lieu thereof, a statement summarizing the actions and dates of such actions taken under Chapter 43.21C RCW; and

(vi) When the project has been modified in the course of the local review process, plans or text shall be provided to the department that clearly indicate the final approved plan. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.045 Submittal requirements.

(m) On all applications for variances pursuant to WMC 16.16.060, the plan shall clearly indicate where development could occur without approval of a variance, the physical features and circumstances on the property that provide a basis for the request, and the location of adjacent structures and uses. (Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.050 Criteria for approval of substantial development permit and conditions authorized.

(1) A substantial development permit shall only be issued when the following criteria have been met:

(a) The policies and procedures of the Act;

(b) The policies and provisions of this regulation;

(c) The applicable master program adopted or approved for the area; and

(d) No permit shall be issued for any new or expanded building or structure of more than 35 feet above average grade level on shorelines of the state that will obstruct the view of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining such shorelines except where a master program does not prohibit the same and then only when overriding considerations of the public interest will be served.

(2) Local government may attach conditions to the approval of permits as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Act and the local master program.

The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate the proposed substantial development is consistent with said criteria.

(3) In considering and/or granting a permit the hearing examiner, shorelines management review committee and the director may attach conditions regarding the location, character, and/or other features of the proposed structure or use, or regarding their effect upon the shorelines, as deemed necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter and the state act and to be in the public interest. Such conditions may require additional work to be done, or work to be done in a certain manner. Plans conditionally approved by the hearing examiner for significant substantial developments shall be considered binding site plans. Conditionally approved developments, or binding site plans may be rescinded for failure to comply with conditions. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.060 Variances.

(1) Applicability. The purpose of a variance permit is strictly limited to granting relief from specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program where there are extraordinary circumstances relating to the physical character for configuration of property such that the strict implementation of the master program will impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020.

Variance permits should be granted in circumstances where denial of the permit would result in a thwarting of the policy enumerated in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances the applicant must demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

(2) Procedures. Variances shall be classified and processed in the same manner as zoning variances, as set forth in Chapter 18.80 WMC.

(3) Criteria. The following criteria shall apply to shoreline variance requests:

(a) Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), and/or landward of any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

(i) That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program precludes, or significantly interferes with, reasonable use of the property;

(ii) That the hardship described in subdivision (1)(A) of this subsection is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size or natural features and the application of the master program, and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant’s own actions;

(iii) That the design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and shoreline master program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment;

(iv) That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area;

(v) That the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief; and

(vi) That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

(b) Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), and as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), or within any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

(i) That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program precludes all reasonable use of the property;

(ii) That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsection (3)(a)(i) through (vi) of this section; and

(iii) That the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected.

(c) In the granting of all variance permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional request for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments and/or uses in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

(d) Variances from the use regulations of the master program are prohibited. (Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.070 Commencement of construction.

No construction pursuant to an approved substantial development permit shall begin or be authorized, and no building, grading or other construction or use permits shall be issued until 45 days have passed from the date of final approval, or until all review proceedings have terminated if such proceedings were initiated within 45 days of the date of final approval of the director, in the case of a nonsubstantial development. (Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


16.16.080 Appeals.

Appeals of any decision on a shoreline substantial development permit or variance shall be made pursuant to WMC 18.94.140. Following exhaustion of all local appeals, any person aggrieved by the local action on a shoreline substantial development permit or variance may seek review from the State Shorelines Hearing Board by filing a request for the same within 30 days of receipt of the final order, and by concurrently filing copies of his request with the State Department of Ecology and the Attorney General, as provided by the Shorelines Management Act. Copies of the appeal shall likewise be filed with the community development director and the city attorney. The burden of proof shall in all cases be upon the person seeking such review.

16.36.030 Additional definitions.

In addition to those definitions contained within WAC 197-11-700 through 197-11-799, when used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context indicates otherwise:

“Department” means any division, subdivision or organizational unit of the city established by ordinance rule, or order.

“Early notice” means the city’s response to an applicant stating whether it considers issuance of a determination of significance likely for the applicant’s proposal (mitigated DNS procedures).

“Ordinance” means the ordinance, resolution or other procedure used by the city to adopt regulatory requirements.

“SEPA rules” means Chapter 197-11 WAC adopted by the Department of Ecology. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.050 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.

(1) The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940 unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency.

(2) When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.

(3) When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.

(4) If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city may be initiated by the director of public works.

(5) Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement must approve the agreement.

(6) Any department making a lead agency determination for a private project shall require sufficient information from the applicant to identify which other agencies have jurisdiction over the proposal (that is: which agencies require nonexempt licenses). (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.055 Additional considerations in time limits applicable to SEPA process.

The following time limits (expressed in calendar days) shall apply when the city processes licenses for all private projects and those governmental proposals submitted to the city by other agencies:

(1) Categorical Exemptions. The city shall identify whether an action is categorically exempt within 14 days of receiving a completed application.

(2) Threshold Determinations.

(a) The city should complete threshold determinations that can be based solely upon review of the environmental checklist for the proposal within 30 days of the date an applicant’s adequate application and completed checklist are submitted, but no sooner than the end of the comment period on any notice of application required pursuant to WMC 18.94.080; provided, nothing in this subsection prevents a determination of significance from being issued before the notice of application.

(b) When the responsible official requires further information from the applicant or consultation with other agencies with jurisdiction:

(i) The city should request such further information within 21 days of receiving an adequate application and completed environmental checklist;

(ii) The city shall wait no longer than 30 days for a consulted agency to respond;

(iii) The responsible official should complete the threshold determination within 15 days of receiving the requested additional information from the applicant or the consulted agency; provided, that a threshold determination shall not be issued until the expiration of the comment period on any notice of application, and shall be issued at least 15 days prior to any open record predecision hearing required pursuant to Chapter 18.84 WMC.

(c) When the city must initiate further studies, including field investigations, to obtain the information to make the threshold determination, the city should complete the studies within 60 days of receiving an adequate application and a completed checklist. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.058 Additional timing considerations.

(1) For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission.

(2) If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. The point at which environmental review may be initiated for specific permits or other licenses requiring detailed project plans and specifications is the submission of a preliminary plat that completely shows the extent of the proposal and any possible impacts. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.060 GMA project review – Reliance on existing plans and regulations.

The city endorses the amended procedures of WAC 197-11-158 regarding reliance on existing plans, laws, and regulations for environmental review and any supplemental provisions adopted pursuant to this part, and shall apply such procedures to the review of project proposals where appropriate. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.062 Planned actions.

The city endorses the amended procedures of WAC 197-11-164 through 197-11-172 regarding the review of projects which meet the criteria for planned actions in accordance with RCW 43.21C.031; such a planned action does not require a threshold determination or the preparation of an environmental impact statement, but is subject to environmental review and mitigation. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.064 SEPA/GMA integration.

The city endorses the amended procedures of WAC 197-11-210 through 197-11-235 regarding the optional integration of SEPA review with actions being considered for adoption under the Growth Management Act and, when used, shall supersede the SEPA process requirements that would otherwise apply. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.066 Monitoring.

The city endorses the amended provisions of WAC 197-11-238 encouraging cities planning under GMA to establish a process for monitoring the cumulative impacts of permit decisions for use in updating plans and information on existing conditions of the built and natural environment. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.068 SEPA/Model Toxics Control Act integration.

The city endorses the amended procedures of WAC 197-11-250 through 197-11-268 regarding the integration of SEPA procedural requirements and documents with those of the Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), Chapter 70.105D RCW and Chapter 173-340 WAC. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.070 Flexible thresholds for categorical exemptions.

(1) The city establishes the following exempt levels for minor new construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(b) based on local conditions:

(a) For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i), up to six dwelling units;

(b) For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i), up to 20 dwellings in the town center core and town center east village zone districts;

(c) For agricultural structures in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(ii), up to 10,000 square feet;

(d) For office, school, commercial recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii), up to 4,000 square feet and/or up to 20 parking spaces;

(e) For office, school, commercial recreational, service or storage buildings in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iii), up to 12,000 square feet and/or up to 20 parking spaces in the town center core and town center east village zone districts;

(f) For parking lots in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(iv), up to 20 parking spaces;

(g) For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v), up to 500 cubic yards.

(2) Whenever the city establishes new exempt levels under this section, it shall send them to the Department of Ecology, Headquarters Office, Olympia, Washington, under WAC 197-11-800(1)(c). (Ord. 1628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009; Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.080 Use of exemptions.

(1) Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal, shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. The department’s determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal.

(2) In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department’s consideration is exempt.

(3) If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter except that:

(a) The city shall not give authorization for:

(i) Any nonexempt action;

(ii) Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact;

(iii) Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives; or

(iv) Any action that would occur, wholly or partially, within any designated critical area. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.090 Environmental checklist.

(1) A completed environmental checklist shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, the proposal is a planned action under RCW 43.21C.031 or SEPA compliance has otherwise been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The checklist shall be in the form of WAC 197-11-960.

(2) For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For a city proposal, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal.

(3) The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:

(a) The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or

(b) The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.093 Threshold determination.

In reviewing the environmental checklist, the responsible official shall apply the threshold determination criteria of WAC 197-11-330 and, if necessary, may initiate the additional information-gathering procedures of WAC 197-11-335. Upon completion of this process, the responsible official shall issue one of the following documents and proceed with requirements of the respective sections and subsections below: determination of nonsignificance (DNS), mitigated DNS, or determination of significance (DS). (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.095 Determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

(1) If the responsible official determines there will be no probable significant adverse environmental impacts from a proposal, a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) shall be prepared. The DNS shall be combined with the environmental checklist and other supporting documents to accompany the proposal through the normal review process.

(2) If the proposal for which any DNS is issued involves another agency with jurisdiction, demolition of any nonexempt structure, issuance of nonexempt clearing or grading permits, or a GMA action, the following requirements apply:

(a) The DNS, environmental checklist, and other supporting documents shall be sent for a 14-day review and comment period to agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal;

(b) Public notice of the DNS shall be given in accordance with WMC 16.36.130; and

(c) The proposal shall not be acted upon for 14 days after the date of issuance of the DNS.

(3) The responsible official shall reconsider the DNS based on comments received, and may retain, modify or withdraw the DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2)(f) and (3)(a). Any modified DNS shall be sent to agencies with jurisdiction, but does not require a new comment period. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.100 Mitigated DNS.

(1) As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.

(2) An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:

(a) Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and

(b) Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for which the department is lead agency.

(3) The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 15 working days. The response shall:

(a) Be written;

(b) State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, area(s) of general or specific area(s) of concern that are leading the city to consider a DS; and

(c) State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarification.

(4) As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.

(5) When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:

(a) If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include these specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a determination of nonsignificance under WAC 197-11-340(2).

(b) If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.

(c) The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific for example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent storm water runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200 foot storm water retention pond at Y location” are adequate.

(d) Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.

(6) A mitigated DNS is issued under WMC 16.36.095(2) and WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice.

(7) Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.

(8) If the city’s tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).

(9) The city’s written response under subsection (2) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. 


16.36.110 Optional DNS process.

(1) If the responsible official has a reasonable basis for determining significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely for a private project, the city may use a single integrated comment period to obtain comments on the notice of application and the likely threshold determination for the proposal. When this process is used a second comment period for the DNS will typically not be required.

(2) Where the optional DNS process is used, the city shall:

(a) State on the first page of the notice of application that it expects to issue a DNS for the proposal, and that:

(i) The optional DNS process is being used,

(ii) This may be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the proposal,

(iii) The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared, and

(iv) A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific proposal may be obtained upon request;

(b) Identify in the notice of application the conditions being considered to mitigate environmental impacts, if a mitigated DNS is expected;

(c) Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public notice in RCW 36.70B.110; and

(d) Send the notice of application and environmental checklist to:

(i) Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal, and

(ii) Anyone who requested a copy of the environmental checklist for the specific proposal.

(3) If the city indicates on the notice of application that a DNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status during the comment period on the notice of application in accordance with WAC 197-11-948.

(4) The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice of application and either:

(a) Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with no comment period using the procedures in subsection (5) of this section;

(b) Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with a comment period using the procedures in subsection (5) of this section, if the city determines a comment period is necessary;

(c) Issue a DS; or

(d) Require additional information or studies prior to making a threshold determination.

(5) If a DNS or mitigated DNS is issued under subsection (4)(a) of this section, the city shall send a copy of the DNS or mitigated DNS to the Department of Ecology, agencies with jurisdiction, those who commented, and anyone requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental checklist need not be recirculated. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.115 Determination of significance (DS).

(1) If the responsible official determines that a proposal may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, a determination of significance (DS) shall be prepared. The DS document shall also serve as a scoping notice for identifying, and soliciting comments on, the issues to be discussed in the required environmental impact statement (EIS). If a determination of significance is made concurrently with any notice of application required pursuant to Chapter 18.84 WMC, the notice of application shall be combined with the DS/scoping notice.

(2) The responsible official shall circulate the DS/scoping notice to the applicant, the Department of Ecology, other agencies with jurisdiction and expertise, affected tribes, and the public. Notice shall be given under WMC 16.36.130. In the event a proposal is changed so as to result in a withdrawn determination of significance, a DNS shall be sent to all who commented in the DS/scoping notice; in such cases a new public notice and 14-day comment period shall be provided. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.118 Scoping.

(1) An environmental impact statement (EIS) is required to analyze only those probable adverse environmental impacts that are significant (RCW 43.21C.031). The responsible official shall narrow the scope of every EIS to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures.

(2) Scoping is required for the preparation of all new draft EISs, but is optional at the discretion of the responsible official for the preparation of a supplemental EIS or when adopting another environmental document for the EIS.

(3) As a minimum, the city shall invite agency and public comment on the scope of the EIS by circulating the DS/scoping notice in accordance with WMC 16.36.115(2). The scoping notice may stipulate that written comments are required, in which case agencies and the public shall be allowed 21 days from the date of issuance of the DS in which to respond. (Ord. 1385 (Exh. A), 2000)


16.36.120 Preparation of EIS – Additional considerations.

(1) Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEIS and FEIS) and draft and final supplemental EISs (SEISs) is the responsibility of the department of community development under the direction of the responsible official. Before the city issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter and Chapter 197-11 WAC.

16.40.010 Purpose.

It is the city of Washougal’s policy to recognize and protect important historic and cultural resources, including those listed on the national, state and local registers of historic places; cultural resources inventoried by the State Archaeologist; and as yet unrecorded sites, objects or structures. The city adopts by this reference the “City of Washougal Archaeological Predictive Model” and associated probability maps from Clark County (which may be periodically updated to reflect the best available information), and establishes the following matrix as a guideline for when an archaeological survey is required based upon: the probability as indicated by Clark County records, the described impact potential of land use applications, and the cited exceptions. (Ord. 1477 § 1, 2004)


16.40.020 Archaeological survey required.

	Predictive

Class	Designation 

Probability Index	Potential for Impacts*

	Low	Moderate	High

	1	1% – 20%  (Low)	No	No	No

	2	21% – 40%  (Low – Moderate)	No	No	Yes

	3	41% – 60%  (Moderate)	No	Yes	Yes

	4	61% – 80%  (Moderate – High)	No	Yes	Yes

	5	81% – 100% (High)	No	Yes	Yes

*Low potential impacts include those activities involving no ground disturbance, normal maintenance and repair of existing structures and facilities, lands that have been substantially disturbed to a depth of more than eight inches, and areas that have been adequately surveyed in the past with no discovery of resources.

*Moderate potential impacts include activities involving slight ground disturbance not otherwise characterized as having low or high impact potential.

*High potential impacts include activities involving disturbance of ore than 12 inches below the ground surface and more than 10,000 square feet of area. 

(Ord. 1477 § 1, 2004)


16.40.030 Exceptions.

(1) A survey should be required for any high potential impact project located within one-quarter mile of a recorded site, regardless of the probability designation.

(2) A survey shall be required for any moderate through high potential impact project within 500 feet of a known unrecorded site, regardless of the probability designation.

(3) A survey shall be required upon discovery of an archaeological site during development of any permitted project, regardless of the probability designation.

(4) A site walkover shall be an adequate survey for properties in the Predictive Class 1 through 3 unless a significant archaeological site has been discovered or indicated. Any more intensive investigation shall be determined by site-specific conditions, which indicate the need for subsurface analysis. (Ord. 1477 § 1, 2004)


16.40.040 Predetermination.

In any case where the preceding criteria calls for an archaeological survey, the project proponent shall provide an archaeological predetermination report by an archaeologist in order to determine whether the likely presence of resources necessitates a survey. (Ord. 1477 § 1, 2004)


16.40.050 Mitigation alternatives.

An archaeological survey shall result in a report addressing the significance of cultural resources present on the site and recommending appropriate mitigation measures. (Ord. 1477 § 1, 2004)

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, blocks within the various districts shall be designed as follows:

(1) Size. Except in the case of a unique and innovative development design, or to accommodate a large industrial or commercial development, block sizes shall be as follows:

(a) In residential and commercial districts, blocks shall not exceed 500 feet in length, except blocks adjacent to arterial streets or unless the previous adjacent layout or topographical conditions justify a variation. Along arterial streets, the minimum distance between intersections on arterial streets shall be 1,800 feet.

(b) In industrial districts, blocks shall not exceed one quarter mile in length, except blocks adjacent to arterial streets or unless the previous adjacent layout or topographical conditions justify a variation. Along arterial streets, the minimum distance between intersections on arterial streets shall be 1,800 feet.

(c) In any block over 500 feet in length, a pedestrian easement or combination pedestrian way and utility easement with a minimum width of 15 feet shall be provided through the middle of the block. If unusual conditions require blocks longer than one quarter mile, two pedestrian ways may be required. When essential for public convenience, such ways may be required to connect to cul-de-sacs. Long blocks parallel to arterial streets may be approved without pedestrian ways in the interests of traffic safety.

(2) Cul-de-Sacs. Shall be in compliance with the Washougal Engineering Standards.

(3) Exceptions. Block size and interconnectivity requirements of subsections (1) and (2) of this section may be modified by the director upon finding that such modification is necessary due to physical constraints, to permit a unique integrated development, to allow for siting of a significant commercial or industrial development, or to further the policies of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1495 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

Where a subdivision or short subdivision adjoins vacant or developable land and to comply with WMC 17.20.020, the community development director or hearing examiner may require streets to be stubbed to property line abutting the adjacent developable land. Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions. The applicant is required to provide a conceptual future street plan demonstrating street stubs are adequate to meet the city’s intersection spacing/block size/cross circulation standards and showing how the proposed street stubs can be extended onto adjacent properties consistent with existing development, topography, streets, etc. Subsequent development is required to comply with the approved future street plan or obtain a modification of the plan. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1495 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


17.20.120 Streets – Half streets.

Half streets are required for the reasonable development of the property, to assure compliance with WMC 17.20.020, and when the director or hearing examiner finds it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half street is adjacent to a vacant developable parcel, the other half of the street shall be platted within such parcel. Reserve strips and street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of half streets. (Ord. 1495 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

At the applicant’s request, the city may allow improvements which may be assured by a financial instrument, such as bond, escrow or certified check, in lieu of construction. The total amount of the financial instrument shall be 150 percent of the costs of actual construction, as evidenced by an estimate prepared and certified by a licensed engineer. If the developer chooses to use this method of assuring improvements, and the city agrees, the final plat may be recorded prior to completion of construction. No building permits shall be issued by the city prior to final acceptance by the city of any and all improvement required by this chapter or as a condition of approval of the development except and until the director finds the following:

(a) That the interests of the public nor the intent of this section would not be compromised by deferral of the improvements; and

(b) That affected departments and agencies agree with the deferral; and

(c) That a financial instrument as described above has been secured in the city’s name for the improvements; and

(d) That the essential elements of required construction have been completed, including:

(i) Sewer, water, electricity, storm sewer systems, and discretionary utilities serving the development have been installed and accepted, and

(ii) At least the first lift of asphalt has been placed on public roadways and construction of private roadways is complete; and

(e) That the deferral of construction of improvements will not result in future damage to systems already accepted by the city for maintenance.

(3) The following improvements shall be installed at the expense of the subdivider in accordance with city requirements:

(a) Streets, including drainage;

(b) Sanitary sewers, unless the area is not accessible to a trunk line;

18.02.010 Title.

This title shall be known and may be cited as the zoning code of the city of Washougal, Washington. (Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.02.020 Authority.

This zoning code, which constitutes a major part of the land development regulations of the city, is enacted pursuant to the requirements and authority of RCW 36.70A.070 (the Washington State Growth Management Act) and the police powers of the city. (Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.02.030 Purpose and intent.

It is the intent of the city council to provide uniform, equitable and reasonable standards to govern the development and use of land, buildings and structures in the interest of health, safety, aesthetics and general welfare of the city, pursuant to the city’s police powers. The city council finds that harmonious and orderly development can best be promoted under these regulations. The text continued in this title and the maps of the comprehensive plan for the city establish and constitute a part of the comprehensive plan and development regulations for the city, by describing the specific uses and restrictions that apply to land use districts in the land use element of the comprehensive plan. These regulations are intended to allow use and development of property that is in compliance with the goals, objectives and policies of the city as expressed in the comprehensive plan.

It is the purpose of these regulations to classify, designate and regulate the development of land for residential, commercial, industrial and public land uses as a means of implementing the Washougal comprehensive plan text and map; to provide adequate open spaces for light, air and the prevention of fires; to provide the economic and social advantages which result from an orderly, planned use of land resources; to provide for desirable, appropriately located living areas in a variety of dwelling types and at a suitable range of population densities; to provide for the preservation of adequate space for industrial, commercial and other activities necessary for a healthy economy; to lessen congestion in the streets; to seek alternative transportation options in conformance with the adopted transportation plan; to stabilize expectations regarding future development, thereby providing a basis for wise decisions with respect to such development, to provide for judicious, efficient, timely and reasonable administration respecting the due process set forth in these regulations and other applicable laws; and to protect and promote the public health, safety, aesthetics and general welfare. (Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.02.040 Use districts and map.

(1) The city is divided into use districts as named and established in this title and the comprehensive plan. The location of boundaries of all use districts designated in this title are established as shown on comprehensive plan maps of the city stated with the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title and signed by the mayor and clerk of the city, referred to as “comprehensive plan maps.” Specifically, the comprehensive plan maps that set forth the boundaries of the use districts established in this title are as follows:

(c) For highway, community and convenience commercial uses, “Exhibit VII” entitled “City of Washougal Commercial Land Allocation.”

(2) The city may provide for consolidation of said maps into a single zoning map. The maps, together with all explanatory matter thereon, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this title. The use districts are as set out below:

18.02.050 Maintenance of the comprehensive plan map.

The original signed copy of the comprehensive plan maps containing the use districts shall be filed in the office of the city clerk of the city pursuant to RCW 35.63.100 and Chapter 35.70A RCW. The use districts may be changed only as set forth in the other sections of this title. All amendments hereafter made to such map shall be shown on such maps, and it shall be the responsibility of the community development director to keep the map updated at all times. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1193 § 1 (Exh. E), 1996; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.02.060 Interpretation of district boundaries.

Where use district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streets or highways, street right-of-way lines or railroad right-of-way lines, or such lines extended, such centerline, or right-of-way line shall be construed to be such boundaries. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, such corporate limit line shall be construed to be such boundaries. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of stream beds or river beds, such centerline shall be construed to be such boundaries.

Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines or such lines extended, such property lines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries. Where a boundary divides a lot into two or more districts, the location of the boundary, unless indicated by dimensions shown on the map, shall be determined by the use of the map scale shown thereon.

Where a public street, alley, utility corridor or other right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned public street, alley or right-of-way.

Where, due to the scale, lack of detail or inapplicability of the foregoing methods, the exact location of a use district boundary cannot be determined, or in cases where uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to a boundary exists, the community development director shall make a determination in writing and record it on the map upon request of any person. Any person aggrieved by such interpretation may appeal such interpretation to the planning commission. In such cases the planning commission shall, upon appeal by a Type III review, either affirm the interpretation of the community development director or otherwise determine the location of the boundary and forward its recommendation to city council. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1193 § 1 (Exh. E), 1996; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.02.070 Use, occupancy and erection to comply with these regulations.

No building, structure, land, open space or water shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, structurally altered or maintained, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure, land, open space or water, nor shall any conditions of or upon real property be caused or maintained, after the effective date of these regulations, except in conformity with the regulations codified in this title. It is unlawful for any person to erect, construct, establish, move into, alter, enlarge, use or cause to be used, any buildings, structures, improvements, lands, open spaces or waters contrary to the provisions of this title. Where this title imposes greater restrictions than those imposed or required by other rules, regulations or ordinances, the provisions of this title shall control. (Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.02.080 Delegation of authority.

The community development director or designee shall have the authority to administer and interpret the provisions of this title. Where specifically indicated, the building official and city attorney shall have such powers as provided by this title. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1193 § 1 (Exh. E), 1996; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)

18.14.010 Purpose.

The R1 single-family zones are intended to implement the city comprehensive plan community vision of providing for a diversity of housing types and sizes and that no more than 75 percent of new housing stock will be of a single product type (i.e., single-family detached residential). The R1 single-family zones are intended for the use and protection of predominantly single-family dwellings, with provisions for the location of two-family dwellings, townhouses or zero lot line homes in certain instances. The R1 single-family zones are also intended to provide for related public and institutional uses such as schools, parks, churches. In limited instances, convenience commercial uses may be permitted within certain R1 single-family zones to serve adjacent and surrounding residential areas.

The R1-5, R1-7.5 and R1-10 districts are intended to provide for single-family residential areas of low urban densities with minimum individual lots sizes of 5,000 square feet, 7,500 square feet and 10,000 square feet, respectively. These districts are located primarily in areas to provide a smooth transition between the lower density residential districts (R1-15) and multiple-family residential districts (AR-16 and AR-22). Some convenience commercial development may be allowed to serve the needs of surrounding residential development, as a conditional use, limited to 3,000 square feet in one structure within the zone district. Duplexes and townhomes may also be allowed.

The R1-15 district is intended to provide for single-family residential areas of low urban densities with minimum individual lot sizes of 15,000 square feet. These districts are located primarily in areas removed from multiple-family residential and commercial development. The larger lots in the R1-15 district are intended to accommodate the demand for more spacious and amenity-based residential development identified in the comprehensive plan. The larger lot sizes are also intended to help protect steep slopes, unstable land and wetlands from overdevelopment. The R1-15 district contemplates the possible need, as conditional uses, for future convenience commercial development, limited to 3,000 square feet in one structure within the zone district, in certain of these areas as residential neighborhoods develop and evolve. (Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421, 2001; Ord. 1264 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)

18.14.045 Maintenance requirement for stormwater facilities.

An easement, or other recorded document, meeting the approval of the community development director and recorded against the lot, shall provide for the ongoing maintenance of all stormwater facilities. (Ord. 1849 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018)


18.14.050 Northeast and northwest UGA additional standards.

In 2016 the city and citizen volunteers invested time and expertise in the question of how best to grow the northeast and northwest urban growth areas.

After an extensive public engagement process, the community reached a consensus that it is in the public interest to promote economic opportunity and higher density housing choices in the downtown core of Washougal and to encourage high quality lower density residential choices and limited commercial development opportunity in the northern urban growth areas. The community consensus is reflected in these additional standards. The standards contained in this chapter will apply to lands within the northeast and northwest areas at the time of annexation into the city of Washougal.

(1) Guiding Principles. Effective planning regulations are guided by principles understood and accepted by the community. The guiding principles supporting this section are:

(a) General Principles, Generally.

(i) Zoning designations should avoid creating nonconforming uses;

(ii) Assure compatibility between zones through the use of open space, landscaping and buffer standards;

(iii) Roads and trails should provide connectivity throughout the area;

(iv) Commercial nodes should be limited in area and scale and serve the neighborhood; and

(v) Steep slopes and critical areas should be retained as open space to the maximum extent practical and all new development shall comply with the city’s environmental regulations (WMC Title 16).

(b) Guiding Principles – Northwest Annexation Area.

(i) Encourage lower density development adjacent to existing large lots;

(ii) Commercial development at the intersection of 23rd and Crown Road should support the new development within the northwest area and Camas; and

(iii) New development should ensure that greenways provide connectivity to trails, views, parks and open space throughout the northwest area.

(c) Guiding Principles – Northeast Annexation.

(i) The neighborhood commercial node at the intersection of 352nd and SE 20th should support new development within the northeast area of the city and should be proximate to the existing fire station;

(ii) Roads and trails should follow slope contours and should connect directly to existing streets; and

(iii) Provide trail connections where topography makes roadway connections impractical.

(2) Zoning. When the city annexes lands situated in the northern UGAs it shall apply residential zoning designation to those lands in a manner fully consistent with the northeast urban growth area preferred alternative map or the northwest urban growth area preferred alternative map. The city shall apply the following zoning designation to the land classifications as follows:

(a) Low density residential = R1-15;

(b) Transitional density residential = R1-10 or R1-7.5;

(c) Medium density residential = R1-5; and

(d) Neighborhood commercial = CV.

(3) Split Zoned Property. Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot in single ownership, the zones shall apply where adopted. The city may refine the zoning district boundary lines consistent with WMC 18.02.060, Interpretation of district boundaries.

(4) Applicable Regulations. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this section, all regulations applicable to these zoning districts shall apply. In the case of a conflict between this section and other elements of WMC Title 17 or this title, the city shall apply the regulation or standard in this section.

(5) Residential Site Development.

(a) All new lots shall meet the minimum lot size of the zoning district unless the subdivision is approved through the PUD process, Chapter 18.64 WMC.

(b) Perimeter lots of the subdivision or PUD not abutting a dedicated public right-of-way, dedicated public facility, or critical area dedicated to the city shall be no smaller than the minimum lot size of the zone in which the subdivision is located.

(6) Buffering Residential Zones. The buffering standards will help ensure compatibility between different zoning districts and protect the property values of existing and future property owners. Where residential districts abut each other and are not separated by a developed public right-of-way, public park, or public trail, lot sizes in higher density districts adjacent to the perimeter of a lower density district shall increase incrementally.

(a) Where an R1-15 zone abuts an R1-10 or R1-7.5 zone the abutting perimeter lots within the R1-10 or R1-7.5 shall be a minimum of 12,000 square feet.

(b) Where an R1-10 or R1-7.5 zone abuts an R1-5 zone the abutting perimeter lots within the R1-5 zone shall be a minimum of 7,500 square feet.

(c) Where a residential zone abuts a commercial zone, commercial buildings and structures, including parking lots, shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the residential zone and shall be consistent with Chapter 18.48 WMC, Aesthetics, Buffers, Compatibility and Landscaping Standards, and shall meet the B3 “high screen buffer” standard.

(d) Where a residential redevelopment abuts a residential lot created by short plat and recorded as Book 2, page 208; Book 2, page 312; Book 2, page 635; and Book/page H963, the abutting lot shall be a minimum of 26,000 square feet.

(7) View Corridors. The city of Washougal is fortunate to have some of the most impressive views of the Columbia River basin and the Cascade Mountain range of any city in Clark County. These views remind us of the majesty of the area and inspire personal reflection. They are a treasure for all and they will be in high demand for future development. Consequently, the intent of this section is to create view corridors along pubic rights-of-way so that all residents can find an opportunity to enjoy the beauty that surrounds Washougal. To accomplish this goal the city adopts the following guidelines and regulations:

(a) Significant View Corridors. For purposes of this subsection, significant view corridors are:

(i) The Columbia River and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area;

(ii) Mt. Hood; and

(iii) The Portland skyline.

(b) Scope. This section applies to present and future public rights-of-way:

(i) With a general north/south alignment;

(ii) Classified as a collector street or higher; or

(iii) Trails.

(c) Orientation. Building orientation should face the street frontage to preserve view corridors. “View corridor” means the line of sight, identified as to height, width, and distance, of an observer looking toward significant sights identified in subsection (7)(a) of this section, from a public right-of-way, public property, or trail.

(d) Development Standards. Along designated public view corridors:

(i) All utilities shall be underground.

(ii) Building facades, excluding single-story porches or stoops shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from a designated view corridor.

(iii) Street trees should be selected to be less than 30 feet at maturity.

(iv) Within front yards landscape materials should not obscure the public view along the view corridor.

(v) In the northeast area open spaces and developed viewing areas should be incorporated into new development greater than nine new lots above 600 feet elevation.

(vi) In the northwest area open spaces and developed viewing areas should be incorporated into new development greater than nine new lots above 550 feet elevation.

(e) At the time of preliminary plat application for a subdivision or planned unit development with more than nine lots the developer shall provide a view corridor analysis that demonstrates consistency with the requirements and development standards in subsection (7) of this section. A view corridor analysis is a three-dimensional study of the view corridor including:

(i) The width of the corridor which is the width of the right-of-way or trail plus 25 feet on either side;

(ii) The height from grade of the lowest point of the right-of-way up to 65 feet; and

(iii) The length of the right-of-way.

(f) The community development director shall have the authority to approve minor modifications in site requirements, such as side and rear yard setbacks, lot coverage and maximum impervious surface standards, if the director finds that granting of a minor variation:

(i) Is consistent with the comprehensive plan;

(ii) Will not create an undue hardship on similarly situated properties; and

(iii) Will further the goal of protecting view corridors along public rights-of-way, public open space, and trails.

(8) Residential Architectural Standards.

(a) Purpose. The purposes of these standards are to ensure compatibility and continuity between and within developments, as well as variety in architecture.

(b) Applicability. The standards of this section apply only to residential subdivisions with more than nine new lots created after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section.

(c) Architectural Design. To ensure architectural variety and to reduce the dominance of garages on the streetscape, applicants for new residential developments shall demonstrate compliance with the following provisions at the time of final plat application and subsequent building permit application:

(i) The street facing facade of each single-family residence shall contain a porch or covered entry area for the primary entrance facing or accessible from the public or private street serving the residence.

(ii) The street facing facade of each dwelling shall contain at least three of the following features:

(A) Garage with decorative door(s);

(B) Bay window(s) facing the street;

(C) Cross gable roof (separate gable ends that intersect meeting in a valley);

(D) Roof dormer(s);

(E) Cupolas or towers;

(F) Pillars or posts;

(G) Eaves, with a minimum six-inch projection;

(H) Offsets in building face by a minimum of 16 inches;

(I) Balconies;

(J) Decorative patterns on exterior finish (e.g., scales/shingles, wainscoting, ornamentation, and similar features);

(K) Use of contrasting materials, such as brick or stone, on a minimum of 25 percent of the facade;

(L) Decorative cornices and rooflines (e.g., for flat roofs);

(M) Trim a minimum of two inches wide around the windows facing a public street;

(N) Varied roofline with at least one intersecting plane; or

(O) Other architectural elements, other than color, glass or lighting, but including varying texture and materials, massing, window voids, or other elements the director finds compatible with the residential character of the zone.

(iii) If a rear facade of a dwelling is visible from a public right-of-way and there is not a buildable lot fully between the nearest point of the rear property line of the subject property and the nearest point of a public right-of-way or private street, the rear facade of the subject dwelling shall also comply with the requirements of subsection (8)(c)(ii) of this section.

(iv) Template Analysis. The street facing facades of dwellings within the prescribed template area shall be substantially different.

(A) Facades shall include combinations of architectural variety such as: front porches, dormers, gables, bay windows, hipped or pitched roofs, orientation of the primary roofline, or similar architectural features described in subsection (8)(c)(ii) of this section that substantially differentiate house facades.

(B) Template Area Described. Along a street frontage the template area consists of the proposed dwelling and:

(1) On the same side of the street as the proposed dwelling: the next eight building lots to the immediate left and right side of the proposed dwelling;

(2) On the opposite side of the street from the proposed dwelling: the dwelling lot opposite the proposed dwelling and the next four building lots to the immediate left and right of the building lot across from the proposed dwelling;

(3) The template area does not extend across public rights-of-way, private streets, or lands dedicated to a public use.

(C) If, at time of review, vacant lots exist within the template area the city will evaluate facade variation based upon the units either built or under building permit review within the template area.

(v) Where houses are served by alleys, all garages and on-site parking shall be accessible from the alley and the facade of the house facing the public street shall be designed as the front of the house including, but not limited to, a primary building entrance consisting of inward swinging door(s), porch(es), window(s) and pathway(s) to the public sidewalks.

(9) Parks, Trails and Open Space. The Washougal “Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Trails Plan” anticipates that the city will need a minimum of 43 acres of park and recreation land by the year 2035 based on a level-of-service standard (LOS) of five acres of parks per 1,000 people.

Parks and trails are an integral part of the overall design and development of the northeast and northwest areas. Consistent with Goal 11 of the Washougal comprehensive plan, the city will identify open space corridors within urban growth areas, including lands useful for recreation, wildlife, trails, and connection of critical areas.

(a) Location. The northeast and northwest UGA preferred alternative maps identify the location of potential trails, trail easements and parks. Future residential development is required to dedicate and construct parks and trails consistent with the locations generally provided in the UGA preferred alternative maps. Dedication and construction may be eligible for park impact fee credits (PIFs).

(b) Applicability. Every residential development larger than 50 units shall provide park or trail facilities within the development and shall provide meaningful connectivity and opportunities to access planned parks and trails.

(c) Park Development Standards.

(i) Required park shall be no smaller than 0.50 acres per 50 units including protected critical areas and dedicated open space.

(ii) Fifty percent of a required park shall be usable for park amenities including picnic areas, viewing or seating areas, play equipment, play fields, trails, or bike or vehicle parking.

(iii) Developed park land should be centrally located within the subdivision and accessible to a majority of residences in the subdivision or planned unit development.

(iv) If dedicated to the city the required park area shall be in one contiguous parcel and shall have public access. If the park land is maintained by a homeowners’ association the park areas may be less than 0.50 acres but not less than 10,000 square feet and may be located throughout the subdivision.

(v) Sidewalks or trails shall provide pedestrian access to each park.

(d) Trail Development Standards.

(i) Where feasible, trail locations should be located within existing utility easements or protected open space corridors.

(ii) Trails shall be multi-modal providing both recreational and transportation functions, including bicycle access.

(iii) Trails shall be designed and constructed consistent with the city’s engineering standards for public works.

(iv) Trails and greenways must ensure connectivity to both the trail and greenway network on the adopted UGA preferred alternative map and provide connectivity to and through existing and future subdivisions and planned development.

(10) Commercial Development. See Chapter 18.32 WMC.

(11) Public Roads. Public roads are an integral part of the overall design and development of the northeast and northwest areas. Consistent with Goal 6 of the Washougal comprehensive plan, the city will “establish an efficient inter- and intra-city circulation system which, by design, integrates the full range of land uses in a way that accommodates and encourages a variety of transportation alternatives such as carpooling, public transit, bicycles and walking.”

(a) Location. The Washougal northeast and northwest UGA preferred alternative maps identify the location and functional classification of potential public roadways. The locations of the roadways on the preferred alternative maps are general and their location is not precisely identified.

(b) Applicability. Future residential development is required to dedicate right-of-way and construct its proportionate share of the public roadways consistent with the locations generally provided in the UGA preferred alternative maps. Dedication and construction may be eligible for traffic impact fee credits (TIFs).

(c) In determining the relationship and responsibility of future development to dedicate land, construct a portion of the public roadway, potential for TIF credits, or need to connect to the roadways identified on the UGA preferred alternative maps, the community development director shall consider:

(i) The 2016 “Washougal NE and NW Urban Growth Area Traffic Impact Analysis” prepared by Global Transportation Engineering and the applicant’s independent traffic impact analysis assessing the development’s potential impacts to the transportation system and potential mitigation measures;

(ii) The proximity of the proposed development to the roadways identified in the preferred alternative map; and

(iii) Whether a nexus exists between the potential impacts of the proposed development and the roadway system identified in the preferred alternative map and, if so, the development’s proportionate share of reasonable mitigation measures, including factors such as:

(A) Topography and critical area limitations which may inhibit the reasonable construction of the public roadway; and

(B) Whether alternative alignments can more easily accomplish the goals of creating an integrated and efficient transportation system which implements the transportation goals of the northeast and northwest UGAs.

(d) Roadway Development Standards. Public roadways shall be designed and constructed consistent with the city’s adopted engineering standards for public works. (Ord. 1823 § 1, 2017)

18.32.010 Purposes.

(1) Convenience Commercial (CV).

(a) The intent of the convenience commercial district is to provide goods and services that cater to the frequent needs of residents in immediately surrounding neighborhoods. This district is designed to be compatible with adjacent residential environments and provide easy accessibility to adjacent neighborhoods. The successful integration of these commercial districts adjacent to neighborhoods serves to reduce vehicle miles traveled and contributes to a more viable neighborhood atmosphere.

(b) Convenience retail and service establishments are the only uses permitted in this district. Normally, the size of the site for a convenience commercial district does not exceed five acres, and typically does not contain more than five individual services or retail establishments. Floor area limitations are imposed to ensure such services and establishments remain small in scale and compatible with the residential environment. Businesses catering to highway traffic are inappropriate due to large areas of parking, heavy traffic volumes, and potential nuisance characteristics such as noise from loudspeakers and odors from painting. Uses that cater to a larger market area, such as major chain grocery stores, are too large in scale to be compatible with immediately adjacent neighborhoods.

(2) Community Commercial District (CC).

(a) The intent of this commercial district is to provide goods and services to a more regional rather than local market area.

(b) Generally, the mix of permitted uses is intended to encourage a pedestrian-friendly environment, one that does not promote extensive vehicle travel. For this reason, highway business uses are generally not permitted and industrial and storage operations that necessitate truck traffic are only permitted as conditional uses if they can peacefully coexist in a pedestrian environment.

(c) Development within this district is typically characterized by very large percentages of the lots occupied by buildings; few, if any, front, side and rear yards.

(3) Highway Commercial District (CH). The highway commercial district is intended to acknowledge the existing highway orientation of a significant stock of commercial development. The purpose of these commercial areas is primarily to serve the needs of highway travelers, conveniently. Uses include intensive commercial activities and establishments that rely on highway-oriented, passerby traffic. Characteristics of these sites include high visibility from highway traffic, large sites, and immediate highway access. This district is not normally suitable adjacent to residential neighborhoods, without substantial mitigation efforts. This district is designed to be the least restrictive of all the commercial districts and includes most every use permitted in the community commercial district. (Ord. 1849 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1503 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1473 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1398 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)

(A) Low walls made of concrete, masonry, or other similar material and not exceeding a maximum height of three feet.

(B) Raised planter walls planted with a minimum 80 percent of evergreen shrubs not to exceed a total height of three feet, including planter wall and landscape planting.

(C) Landscape plantings consisting of trees of which at least 80 percent are deciduous and shrubs and groundcover materials of which at least 80 percent are evergreen. A clear view between three and eight feet above the ground shall be maintained.

(D) Bioretention facilities. A clear view between three and eight feet above the surrounding grade shall be maintained.

(E) An element not listed here that meets the intent.

(iii) Walls and raised planters shall not exceed a maximum height of three feet, unless all of the following are provided:

(A) Screen treatment does not create a safety hazard.

(B) Portion of treatment that is above three feet in height is a minimum 75 percent transparent (i.e., see-through metal railing, trellis, or other similar treatment).

(C) Portion of wall/landscape treatment that is above three feet in height provides added visual interest, detail, and character suitable to the character of the development.

(iv) Fencing around parking lots shall be allowed if the following conditions are met:

(A) All screen fencing should not exceed a maximum height of six feet, and any portion higher than three feet must be 75 percent transparent.

(B) Fencing and architectural details shall complement the materials used in the development.

(C) Chain link fencing, coated or uncoated, shall not be used on any street frontage or adjacent public sidewalk.

(i) Parking Lot Landscape (see Appendix A, Figures 19 through 21).

Intent: to reduce the visual impact of parking lots through landscaped areas and/or architectural features that complement the overall design and character of development.

(i) Parking lot landscape should reinforce pedestrian and vehicular circulation, especially parking lot entrances, ends of driving aisles, and pedestrian walkways leading through parking lots.

(ii) The number of trees required in the interior landscape area in parking lots shall be dependent upon the location of the parking lot in relation to the building and public right-of-way:

(A) Where the parking lot is located between the building and the public right-of-way, one tree for every four spaces shall be provided.

(B) Where the parking lot is located to the side of the building and partially abuts the public right-of-way, one tree for every six spaces shall be provided.

(C) Where the parking lot is located behind the building and is not visible from the public right-of-way, one tree for every eight spaces shall be provided.

(D) Required street trees may be counted towards these ratios if they screen the parking lot.

(E) Trees planted within bioretention facilities may be counted toward these ratios if they screen the parking lot.

(iii) To protect vegetation, a minimum four-foot area from the base shall be provided for all trees and shrubs where vehicle overhang extends into landscape areas.

18.35.020 Districts described and delineated.

(1) TC-C – Town Center Core. This district is envisioned to have the highest intensity uses, especially retail, offices, residences, and hotels contained within mid-rise buildings. Shops and restaurants would be located along key streets, particularly a principal pedestrian corridor. A major public open space would anchor the district. Over time, parking would be increasingly located within structures.

(2) TC-EV – Town Center East Village. This district is envisioned to have a mixture of higher density housing and retail contained within low-rise buildings. Some retail uses would be auto-oriented and have somewhat large footprints. Public open spaces would be found throughout the district.

(3) TC-WV – Town Center West Village. This district is envisioned as a predominantly residential area with some modest infill development on vacant and underutilized parcels. Any development would be low-rise. The district would also contain public buildings and uses.

Corral’s estimated cost is $1,000; adding labor and additions for stability and safety brings an estimated total to $3,000 – $4,000. Safety is a concern with people and bikes in the street, so bike corral boundaries are sometimes lined with black and yellow reflective flexible poles. Usually installed in corner parking spaces. Businesses advocate for bike corrals at their storefronts because they clean up the sidewalk area. 2

Twelve to 14 bicycles can be parked in one vehicular parking space (Cities Go Green).

18.38.010 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to set forth the standards, incentives and guidelines for development within the Woodburn Hill subarea. The standards are intended to set forth a framework that allows for flexibility in design and development while preserving, to the greatest degree possible, the environmentally sensitive areas and open space opportunities within the subarea while balancing these interests with those of private property rights. (Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1253 § 1, 1997)


18.38.020 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter apply to all land located within the Woodburn Hill subarea as identified in the city of Washougal 20-year growth management plan, Element IV(a) (Woodburn Hill subarea plan). It shall be the responsibility of the community development director to interpret and apply the provisions of these standards, and has the authority to modify any standard contained within this chapter if necessary to meet the intent of the standard, in light of physical constraints or unique development design. It shall be the responsibility and authority of the director to interpret and apply the provisions of these standards to assure the intent of these standards is met. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1253 § 1, 1997)


18.38.030 Environmental review.

(1) In reviewing development proposed on land located within the subarea, if in compliance with these regulations and the provisions of the subarea plan elements, the director shall rely to the greatest extent possible on the environmental analysis and documents prepared and adopted as part of the subarea plan.

(2) Where development proposals are consistent with the subarea plan, the director shall adopt the EIS prepared for the plan as the environmental analysis, with addenda analysis only as necessary to address the elements of the development proposal not addressed by the EIS.

(3) Additional environmental review shall be required in the following cases:

(a) The scope of the proposed development exceeds that contemplated in the subarea plan EIS with respect to any other analyzed environmental elements;

(b) The proposed development will have an impact on an element of the environment which was not considered in the scope of the Woodburn Hill EIS. (Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1253 § 1, 1997)


18.38.040 Residential development.

In light of the physical constraints within the subarea, it is the intent of the city to allow flexibility in site design and layout for residential uses. The reliance upon minimum building envelope standards and maximum densities instead of lot size standards is intended to facilitate flexible site design, as well as to encourage retention of unbuildable areas in common open space tracts as opposed to under individual private ownerships.

(1) Residential Uses. Manufactured housing shall not be permitted within the subarea. The following residential uses shall be permitted within the subarea in accordance with the density provisions of this section:

(a) Detached single-family;

(b) Townhouses;

(c) Zero lot line developments;

(d) Residential condominiums;

(e) Public use, limited.

(2) Conditional Uses. The following uses shall be conditional throughout the subarea, subject to the provisions of Chapter 18.72 WMC:

(a) Assisted living or congregate care facilities;

(b) Day care centers;

(c) Public uses;

(d) Churches;

(e) Apartments, with a maximum of 60 units in any single complex, subject to design review.

(3) Densities. All densities referred to throughout these standards shall mean units per gross acre. Densities in the Woodburn Hill subarea shall be in accordance with Table 18.38-1, except as provided for in this subsection and subsection (4) of this section.

(a) In situations where the physical environment on the site warrants such allocations, the density provisions of Table 18.38-1 may be modified by the director, subject to the design standards of WMC 18.38.090, to meet the intent of this section. However, the maximum residential density on any single development site throughout the subarea shall not exceed 4.7 gross units per acre, and the overall number of units provided within the subarea shall not exceed 1,410.

(4) Density Transfers. Portions of sites encumbered by land identified as sensitive due to the presence of steep slopes, unstable land, historical or archaeological sites, wetlands and buffers, commons, land voluntarily or mandatorily set aside for open space or other permanent physical development limitations, but not including required or existing rights-of-way, as may be determined or approved by the director, may be eligible for transfer of density. The residential density otherwise able to be achieved on such gross acreage may be transferred to the remaining unencumbered land areas, subject to the following limitations:

(a) Intraparcel Transfer. The maximum number of units which can be transferred is limited to the number of whole units (fractions of units shall be rounded down) which would have been allowed on the unbuildable area described in this section, not to exceed 125 percent of the maximum density set forth in Table 18.38-1; provided, however, the maximum number of units shall be calculated based on the gross area of the site, minus any public road right-of-way, and the maximum density allowed will be dependent upon site characteristics and other factors.

(b) Interparcel Transfer. Density may be transferred between parcels or ownerships within the subarea; provided, that the overall maximum density for the subarea shall not be exceeded and that the maximum density allowed in any particular area, as set forth in Table 18.38-1, is not exceeded by more than 125 percent.

(i) The city shall maintain a record of the number of units preliminarily approved for construction within the subarea and allow interparcel density transfer of the unused density to subsequent development proposals, upon request by the applicant of those developments, and give priority for use of interparcel density on the basis of technically complete determination.

(5) Height. Height of structures shall be measured from the mean point of adjacent grade to the highest point of the structure, excluding architectural features such as chimneys. The maximum height within the subarea shall be 35 feet, except:

(a) Structures located above the 510-foot elevations shall include features that mitigate the potential impacts on the appearance of the ridgeline including, but not limited to:

(i) Height restrictions;

(ii) Complex roof gables and articulations, or incorporation of dormers or other architectural features to eliminate monotonous roof lines;

(iii) Restriction of building location and type;

(iv) Incorporation of porches and other architectural features on southern building faces that eliminate monolithic blank walls;

(v) Planting of mature vegetation on the north side of structures to provide a natural silhouette backdrop. Such planting shall be selected to assure that at least 25 percent of their crown is above of the height of the structure at time of planting;

(vi) Other measures approved by the review authority.

(6) Medical marijuana cooperatives as defined in RCW 69.51A.250 are prohibited.

(7) Recreational marijuana producers, processors and retailers as defined in RCW 69.50.101 are prohibited.

2This density may be exceeded by a maximum of 125 percent with use of the density transfer of WMC 18.38.040(2). Maximum densities listed in this table do not guarantee these densities throughout each parcel within the subarea. Physical or topographical restrictions may prohibit achieving these densities.

3Increased densities may be warranted throughout the subarea regardless of the slope conditions, depending upon design, configuration and compatibility. Densities may be increased upon certification of suitability by a licensed geotechnical engineer of the area for construction. Densities on slopes of 15 percent shall not exceed eight units per acre and shall be subject to approval by the review authority.

4Building envelope includes the buildable area of a lot unencumbered by setbacks, unbuildable slopes, irregular lot configuration, environmentally sensitive areas or other restrictions which may make the land unbuildable.

5Minimum and maximum setbacks may decrease by one foot for each one percent of slope in excess of 10 percent to a minimum of six feet for the residence (not garage). Front porches that extend beyond the front face of the primary structure may intrude into front yard setbacks. However, no reduction in a setback or intrusion of a front porch may be permitted that will interfere with sight distance.

6The front setback of the residence may be reduced by the same distance that the front of the garage is set back from the primary face of the residence, to a maximum reduction of five feet (10 feet rather than 15).

7This minimum setback provision shall not apply to garages with entrance doors oriented perpendicular to the adjacent street to form a parking court. (There is to be 18 feet of parking area length inside of the back of the curb and/or sidewalk or planter strip; whichever is the farthest interior to the lot, in order for vehicles not to encroach either into a pedestrian way or roadway.)

8Except as provided for in nonresidential development under WMC 18.38.050.

(2) An improved community park not less than five acres in area shall be provided within the subarea as generally indicated on the adopted land use map. “Improved” shall mean that at least 75 percent of the gross land area is actively useable via pedestrian trails, playground or fitness equipment, picnic areas or other such amenities. The properties ultimately affected by the final location of the park shall be eligible for park impact fee credit up to the value of the raw land costs plus improvements. Potential residential densities lost as a result of park provisions may be transferred in accordance with WMC 18.38.040(4). The director or review authority may approve alternative park and open space plans which meet the intent of this subsection.

(3) Where possible and feasible, passive open spaces, such as unbuildable ravines and stream corridors, throughout development within the subarea shall ultimately be improved with an integrated network of pedestrian amenities, which connect to the existing street network or to other trail systems in the area such as the Washougal River Greenway, Lacamas Creek Park and parks within the subarea. Such unbuildable areas shall either be dedicated to the city or encumbered with public easements for pedestrian facilities. Easements shall be composed of a 20-foot wide construction easement which, upon completion of trail construction and an eight-foot wide perpetual pedestrian easement, will expire. If such areas are improved with public pedestrian trails by the developer, the developer shall be eligible for park impact fee credits for the costs of improvement only.

(4) Development of active recreational opportunities is strongly encouraged in developments throughout the subarea. Such spaces shall be provided in accordance with the following standards:

(a) Developments of 50 units or more or with an exterior boundary greater than 0.25 miles from any existing, planned or proposed park facility shall provide neighborhood parks as follows:

(i) Parks shall have an area of 10 percent of the gross site development area or one acre, whichever is greater, but not to exceed five acres for any individual park. Developments greater than one quarter mile in any dimension shall provide multiple parks consistent with this intent.

(ii) Parks shall be fronted on at least 50 percent of their perimeter by public streets, and shall have a minimum of 75 percent of their area improved with active open spaces such as fitness facilities, picnic areas, playgrounds or pedestrian trails.

(iii) Whenever possible, parks should incorporate undevelopable areas such as wetlands or on slopes which take advantage of views.

(iv) Parks provided consistent with this section shall be eligible for park impact fee credits, pursuant to Chapter 15.62 WMC. (Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1253 § 1, 1997)


18.38.080 Slope protection and erosion control.

(1) Development on slopes in excess of 15 percent and on slopes transitioning to these steep areas (within 100 lineal feet of the crest or toe of a steep slope) shall comply with the following:

(a) Planning of development within the subarea shall take into account the topography, soils, geology, hydrology and other conditions existing on the proposed site.

(b) Development shall be designed and oriented on the site so that grading for infrastructures, build out and other site preparation is kept to a minimum.

(c) Essential grading shall be shaped and engineered so as to blend with natural land forms and to minimize the necessity of padding and/or terracing of building sites.

(d) In addition to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, projects shall be phased into workable units on which construction shall be scheduled to minimize soil disturbance and to control erosion in accordance with the approved erosion control plan.

(e) Areas not well suited for development because of soil, geology, vegetation or hydrology limitations should be allocated for open spaces and recreational uses, consistent with WMC 18.38.070(2).

(f) Disruption of existing plant and animal life shall be minimized. Existing deep-rooted vegetation on slopes of 15 percent or greater shall be removed only as necessary to construct roads and infrastructure prior to final plat approval. Prior to any earthwork, the applicant shall submit a detailed vegetation plan that indicates preservation, during infrastructure construction, of all trees with a dripline outside of the right-of-way. The plan shall include an inventory of all trees with a 10-inch DBH or greater, their species, size, trunk location and extent of dripline. Removal of deep-rooted vegetation on individual lots with slopes in excess of 15 percent shall be in conjunction with residential construction only, and shall be limited to that necessary to locate individual residences. If deep-rooted trees are removed to accommodate residences, root structures shall be preserved whenever possible to assist in slope stabilization and erosion control.

(g) Soil disturbance shall be minimized.

(h) Developments shall, to the extent possible and feasible, include implementation of best management practices (BMPs) for slope and soil stabilization, grading and landscaping.

(i) Lots with building envelopes that have slopes in excess of 15 percent shall include preplanned building pad and driveway locations which incorporate the intent and provisions of this section.

(2) In addition to the erosion control requirements of the city of Washougal Engineering Standards and subsection (1) of this section, no earthwork activity shall occur on slopes in excess of 25 percent between the dates of October 1st and May 1st, providing that the city of Washougal may extend or shorten this time period on a case-by-case basis depending on actual weather conditions.

(3) The use of temporary portable crushers may be permitted throughout the subarea as warranted to use on-site material for infrastructure construction or in conjunction with approved hillside excavation. Sale of on-site rock, whether crushed or uncrushed, is not permitted. Blasting, rock, and/or crushed rock on the site is allowed only for on-site infrastructure. However, such use shall be identified in the initial application for preliminary development approval, and shall be subject to the following restrictions:

(a) The applicant shall demonstrate that the excavation is necessary to accommodate development within the standards of this chapter and that it is the minimum necessary to accommodate such development.

(b) The applicant shall demonstrate that there are no practicable or feasible alternatives to the use of on-site crushers, such as use of rippers or strippers.

(c) Use of on-site crushers shall be limited to the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Saturday and no use on Sunday.

(d) Any blasting necessary for construction, due to geological conditions, shall be completed in accordance within the time frames outlined in the applicable provisions of the RCW and WAC and shall obtain a blasting permit from the city of Washougal fire department. (Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1253 § 1, 1997)


18.38.090 Design standards.

(1) Development Compatibility and Continuity. Development within the subarea shall be designed to the following standards to assure compatibility and continuity between and within developments:

(a) Directly abutting residential uses, either within a single proposal or between a proposed and existing or preliminarily approved development, shall be designed to assure that there is a maximum 25 percent density increase or decrease to transition between housing types or densities. When separated by a street, facing housing types shall be the same and densities of facing residential uses shall be within 10 percent of each other. The provisions of this section may be modified by the director upon finding:

(i) That physical site constraints require development to be designed with a separation of more than 300 feet between building envelopes; or

(ii) That the physical site conditions warrant differing densities, pursuant to Table 18.38-1, and the result is differing housing types. In this case, the applicant shall submit architectural renderings of the proposed development that demonstrate architectural and functional compatibility between the differing housing types and/or densities.

(b) Attached single-family development built immediately adjacent to detached single-family development shall be designed and constructed so as to approximate the height, scale, bulk and appearance of typical single-family residential development of the adjacent zone in order to provide a transition between types of development.

(c) Nonresidential development should not be located immediately adjacent to detached single-family residential development. If such developments do abut, each type of development shall be subject to the following:

(i) Nonresidential Development.

(A) The abutting boundary shall be improved with a 10-foot-wide vegetated buffer consisting of live ground cover and trees planted an average of one per 30 lineal feet on center, filled between with evergreen shrubs which are a minimum height at planting of three feet and reach a minimum height of six feet within three years of planting.

(B) The scale, bulk and appearance of the building facade facing the residential development shall be designed to minimize monolithic or monotonous walls facing residential uses, consistent with subsection (3) of this section.

(ii) Residential Development.

(A) If not separated by a street, the abutting residential development should be attached single-family or multifamily, and shall have a minimum density of six units per acre.

(B) If separated by a street, the abutting residential may be single-family or multifamily, and shall have a minimum density of four units per acre.

(2) View Preservation.

(a) To the extent possible and feasible, developments on slopes in excess of 15 percent shall implement a combination of development design, plat restrictions and/or construction restrictions which assure preservation of private view corridors for 50 percent of the units within the development, as well as public view points from within the subarea, to the Portland city lights, Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and/or Mt. Hood. Such measures may include restrictions in height, placement of homes, tree removal or replanting, or other mechanisms approved by the director to preserve or enhance views from the development.

(b) To preserve, to the extent possible and feasible, the natural beauty of Woodburn Hill as a view amenity from within the city, developments visible from the lowlands of the city (i.e., north of Shepherd Road) shall retain existing vegetation to the greatest degree possible to preserve the visual integrity and continuity of hillsides within the city. If tree removal occurs as a result of development, street trees and open space plantings shall occur as a condition of plat approval that assure a developed canopy, which at least partially obscures visibility of rooftops and streets from city lowlands.

(c) Primary view corridors from residences north of the subarea that exist at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this section shall be preserved by incorporating design elements that preserve views, such as height limitations, lot configuration or building placement.

(3) Nonresidential Development.

(a) Site Design.

(i) Primary building entrances shall be oriented toward the public street and pedestrian facilities.

(ii) Parking, driveways or auto maneuvering areas shall not separate the primary face of the building (front entry face) from the abutting street.

(iii) Nonresidential development shall provide accessible and accommodating spaces for public civic interaction via pedestrian plazas, street furniture and public open spaces wherever appropriate and feasible.

(iv) Buildings on corner lots shall, where appropriate, be located on the street corner with building frontages on both streets and primary entrances oriented toward the intersection. If no buildings are located at street corners, pedestrian plazas and amenities shall provide a focus for the area.

(v) If buildings are not located at the corner intersections, monumentation shall be incorporated at key or focal intersections within or on the perimeter of developments to foster a sense of community identity and arrival. Monument shall be of an appropriate size, scale and design to accomplish this.

(b) Architectural and Building Design.

(i) The ground floor of building facades facing streets shall have at least 50 percent of the total wall area in permeable surfaces (windows, pedestrian entrances, open shops).

(ii) Buildings with frontages greater than 50 lineal feet shall vary the building line and create offsetting walls, awnings, arcades, modulated wall textures, climbing landscaping materials and other features that break down the scale of the wall.

(iii) Buildings shall integrate awnings, overhangs or other rain protection features when abutting pedestrian amenities.

(iv) The exterior finish of buildings is encouraged to be similar to that of abutting uses, but shall not be corrugated metal or vertical jointed wood siding (TI-11).

(c) Signage. All signage within the subarea shall be monument signage. Any proposed sign lighting shall be indirect with no backlit, flashing or neon. All other sign provisions shall be in accordance with Chapter 18.60 WMC.

(4) Stormwater. The city shall ultimately maintain and operate a stormwater conveyance and disposal system for the subarea. Such a system will provide for conveyance from developments within the subarea to a regional detention facility and/or a direct outfall to the Washougal River. The responsibility for design, permitting and construction of the outfall shall be the responsibility of the developers within the subarea. This may be accomplished by private construction of the outfall and subsequent reimbursement via a “latecomer” system, or by formation of a stormwater LID. The city will, to the extent possible, assist and facilitate the permitting of construction of the disposal outfall structure and conveyance lines from the north line of Shepherd Road to the point of outfall. Upon completion, the system will be publicly owned and maintained. Development within the subarea shall be responsible for treating and disposal of increased stormwater runoff consistent with the provisions of the Washougal Engineering Standards, except as modified below:

(a) All development shall provide methods for on-site stormwater quality treatment consistent with the city of Washougal Engineering Standards.

(b) If, at the time of development, the stormwater collection and outfall system referenced in subsection (4) of this section is not in place, development shall provide interim detention or retention facilities designed in accordance with the provisions of the city of Washougal Engineering Standards.

(c) Stormwater utility plans for all new development shall include dry stormwater transmission lines configured so as to accommodate abandonment of interim facilities and connection to the overall stormwater conveyance system.

(5) Streets. Streets shall generally occur as indicated on the street network map included in the subarea plan and as provided for in this subsection. However, the street network map provided in the plan is conceptual, and shall not be constituted to require strict compliance with the alignments which occur in that plan. The street alignments that appear on the street network map in the subarea plan are intended to indicate where critical street connections need to occur, not necessarily actual physical street alignments.

(a) Street Classifications. There shall be three basic street classifications within the subarea. Other street types may be appropriate upon technical site design, and may be approved by the director upon concurrence with the fire chief and the director of public works. Where standards are not specified in this section, the city of Washougal Engineering Standards shall prevail. The basic street classifications are as follows:

(i) Residential Collector. Residential collector streets are intended to provide primary and consistent connections to, from and between developments within the subarea and to the surrounding street network. There are three residential collectors within the subarea as shown on the Woodburn Hill Subarea Street Network Map, one providing primary east-west connection between 40th Street on the east and Crown Road on the west, one providing north-south connection from Shepherd Road to the east-west area collector, and a second north/south connection from Shepherd Road to the northerly boundary of the current urban growth boundary with ultimate connection to 30th Street. Residential collectors generally carry through traffic from contiguous residential areas. Emphasis is on facilitating pedestrian use.

(ii) Residential Access. A residential access is intended to provide primary means of conveying traffic from residential areas to residential collectors. Through trips are discouraged on residential access. Emphasis is on facilitating pedestrian use.

(iii) Residential Local. Residential local roads are intended to provide direct access to properties within neighborhoods to convey traffic to the residential access and residential collector system.

(b) Except as specifically modified in this section, streets within the subarea shall comply with the provisions of Table 18.38-2.

(c) There shall be a residential collector, constructed to the standards contained in Table 18.38-2, running east-west through the subarea which provides a physically uninterrupted connection between the east end of 40th Street and Crown Road. There shall be an additional residential collector that provides a north-south connection from the eastern portion of Shepherd Road north to the east-west area collector. “Physically uninterrupted” shall mean the collector has no angular turns, no curves with a centerline radius of less than 250 feet and no intersection offset.

(d) Wherever practicable and feasible, development shall be designed to provide cross circulation at maximum intervals of 500 feet on all streets. Where meeting this standard is not practicable or feasible due to physical obstructions such as topography or other environmental features, pedestrian connections shall be provided between roadways at this interval.

(e) There shall be no direct access restrictions on any streets within the subarea, except to provide for safe separation between driveway intersections and public street intersections, to preserve sight distance for vehicles entering roadways, residential collectors, or to assure other safety provisions as determined by the public works director. Maximum width of residential curb cuts shall be 20 feet.

(f) The maximum curb cut onto a public street for nonresidential development shall be no less than 24 feet and no greater than 36 feet.

(g) There shall be a traffic circle, median or other traffic calming device approved by the director incorporated into the design of the eastern intersection indicated on the street network map.

(6) Streetscapes. In order to preserve and enhance the street as a public space, the following provisions shall be incorporated into developments:

(a) There shall be no fencing in excess of three feet in height between the front face of any building and the street.

Cul-de-sacs shall comply with Section 3B.08, Street Ends, of the Washougal Engineering Standards.

(b) Rear yards of residential developments shall be oriented to the interior of blocks. Development design shall, to the extent possible and feasible, assure that no rear yard abuts a public street with a classification of loop/cul-de-sac or higher.

(c) The use of rear-loading (private alley fed) lots may be permitted subject to the following:

(i) The lot also has street frontage on an improved public right-of-way containing a parking lane on both sides of the public roadway,

(ii) The home faces the public roadway,

(iii) Parking within or on either side of the alley is prohibited and signed,

(iv) The alley has sufficient width and an approved street end approved by the director of public works and fire chief,

(v) Public utilities shall not be allowed within an alleyway.

(d) Planter Strips. Planter strips required by Table 18.38-2 shall be planted an average of every 30 feet on center with a deciduous canopy tree, with the balance of the planter strip planted and maintained with live groundcover. Detached sidewalks are required so that the planter strips are located behind the curb. Street trees shall have a three-inch caliper diameter breast height (DBH) at time of planting and shall reach a mature height of at least 50 feet to top of crown. Street trees shall be certified by registered landscape architect or certified arborist to be of a variety with a root structure that is least intrusive into utility lines or disruptive to sidewalks, and shall be selected and placed so as not to conflict with view preservation in subsection (2)(a) of this section, and to augment and enhance the provisions of subsection (2)(b) of this section.

(7) Lighting. Street and building lighting within the subarea shall be designed and placed in a manner that assures safety, while minimizing glares on adjacent properties, particularly rural properties abutting urban development. (Ord. 1658 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1253 § 1, 1997)


18.38.100 Supplemental submittal requirements.

(1) In addition to the submittal requirements outlined in Chapters 17.12 or 18.94 WMC, preliminary development applications within the subarea shall submit the following:

(a) Topographic information with contours at a minimum of two-foot intervals;

(b) Calculations of the amount of land in each slope threshold contained in Table 18.38-1, to the tenth of an acre;

(c) Density calculations demonstrating compliance with the density provisions of WMC 18.38.040;

18.40.010 Purposes.

(1) Light Industrial (LI). The intention of this district is to provide suitable areas for a variety of industrial uses including manufacturing, wholesale trade and distribution activities. The industries locating in this district can be characterized as clean and generally compatible with surrounding commercial uses. The light industrial districts are intended to contain uses that will not generate excessive noise, pollution, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors, radiation and other nuisance characteristics. Certain commercial activities having an open storage characteristic, or which are most appropriately located as neighbors of industrial uses, are also included as permitted uses in this district. Light industrial districts are only intended to be located in areas with relatively level topography, adequate water and sewerage facilities, and access to arterial streets and highways. Such uses do not necessarily require air, rail and water transportation.

(2) Heavy Industrial District (HI). The heavy industrial district is intended to provide suitable areas for manufacturing, assembling, fabrication and processing, bulk handling, storage, warehousing and trucking. The uses associated with this district may generate significant levels of truck traffic, noise, pollution, vibration, dust, gas, fumes, odors and radiation and create fire or explosion hazards or other objectionable conditions. Uses within this district may require rail and water transportation. Conditional uses permitted in this district are primarily those known to create a severe safety hazard or to be a major producer of air pollution, thus being subject to state and/or federal environmental statutes. The heavy industrial district is highly unsuitable adjacent to residential districts. (Ord. 1520 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1264 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)

(2) Support the growth management goal of more efficient use of urban residential land;

(3) Support development of diverse housing in accordance with the comprehensive plan;

(4) Provide an alternative type of detached housing providing small residences for households of typically one to two individuals as part of the city’s overall housing strategy, which intends to encourage affordability, innovation, and variety in housing design and site development and to promote a variety of housing choices to meet the needs of a population diverse in age, income, household composition and individual needs;

(5) Provide opportunities for creative, diverse, and high quality infill development within existing neighborhoods;

(6) The cottage housing development design standards contained in this chapter are intended to create a small community of cottages oriented around open space that is pedestrian-oriented and minimizes the visibility of off-street parking. These design standards are intended to ensure that cottage housing developments include pedestrian amenities and take advantage of existing trail features on the site including topography and vegetation. The cottage housing development design standards are intended to maintain traditional cottage amenities and proportions and ensure that cottage housing developments contribute to the overall community character;

(7) Cottage housing may allow higher residential density than is normally allowed in the underlying zone district. This increased density is possible with smaller than average home sizes, clustered parking, and site design standards;

(8) Cottage housing developments are subject to special density standards. (Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


18.45.020 Applicability.

Cottage housing developments are only allowed on parcels two and one-half acres or smaller. (Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


18.45.030 Density.

Two cottage housing units shall be allowed in place of each single-family home allowed by the base density of the district.

Cottage housing units shall be developed in groups of a minimum of four units to a maximum of 12 units.

Cottage housing is not subject to minimum area and lot dimensions requirements of the underlying zone district, although the maximum lot size permitted is 3,000 square feet. The maximum lot size is not applicable to a condominiumized cottage development. (Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


18.45.040 Cottage housing floor area (maximum size).

Residences in cottage housing developments are primarily intended for one- and two-person households and their occasional guests. Maintaining the maximum square footage of residences in cottage housing developments is necessary to prevent overbuilding of the site and not to exceed available off-street parking.

The total floor area of each cottage unit shall not exceed 1,200 square feet. “Total floor area” is the area included with the surrounding exterior walls, but excluding any space where the floor-to-ceiling height is less than six feet. (Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


18.45.050 Approval process for cottage housing developments.

Cottage housing developments within the TC, AR-16, AR-22, R1-5, R1-7.5, and R1-10 zone districts require site plan review approval in addition to the requirements of WMC 18.45.110. (Ord. 1849 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)

Such nonconforming dwelling units shall be included in the maximum permitted cottage density.

(2) New accessory dwelling units (ADU) are not permitted in cottage housing developments.

(3) All residential units in a cottage housing development count towards the maximum permitted density.

(4) An existing attached or detached ADU that is accessory to an existing nonconforming single-family structure may be counted as a cottage unit if the property is developed subject to the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


18.45.070 Design standards.

(1) Building Height. Structures in cottage housing developments shall be designed to be single-story or single-story plus a loft.

(a) The height limit for all structures shall not exceed 18 feet.

(b) The highest point of a pitched roof may extend up to 25 feet at the ridge of the roof.

(2) Covered Usable Main Entry Porches. All residences in cottage housing developments shall be provided with a covered main entry porch to create a private outdoor space protected from the weather and provide a transition from the interior private residential space to the semi-private outdoor space. Covered porches shall be usable in both design and dimension.

(a) Cottage homes shall have a covered main entry porch with a floor area measuring at least 80 square feet in size.

(b) The floor of the covered main entry porch shall have minimum dimensions of not less than five feet in any direction (length or width).

(3) Exterior Trims and Roof Eaves. Cottage housing development structures shall be provided with substantial exterior trim elements consistent with traditional northwest cottage design and small home craftsmanship. Roofs in cottage housing developments shall have eaves to recognize traditional northwest cottage design traits to efficiently shed rain and provide rain protection for exterior walls.

(a) All windows and doors shall provide trim with a minimum width of three and one-half inches for all cottage housing development structures.

(b) Eaves of at least 12 inches shall be provided on all cottage structures on at least two sides of each building. Where buildings are not square (one set of exterior parallel walls is longer than the other), the eaves shall be provided on the parallel walls that are the longest.

(4) Street-Facing Facades. The street-facing facades of cottages in a cottage housing development will contribute to the neighborhood by including attractive design details such as windows, changes in materials, and views of front doors or porches. The main entries of some cottages will be visible from the adjacent streets to provide a visual pedestrian connection with the surrounding neighborhood.

(a) All cottages shall have street-facing facades that avoid blank walls or appearing to “turn their backs” to the street. All cottages shall include one or more of the following on street-facing facades:

(i) Changes in exterior siding material and paint color;

(ii) Windows which may include bay windows; and/or

(iii) Building modulation with a depth measuring at least one foot.

(b) At least one cottage shall have its front main entry door and/or front porches visible from each street frontage.

(5) Setbacks for all structures from property lines shall be not less than five feet.

(a) Setbacks for all structures from property lines shall be no less than five feet and not less than 10 feet from a public street. 

(b) Exception. The community development director in consultation with the public works director may authorize the setback of five feet from the public right-of-way where the location of all structures, landscaping, and other improvements will not conflict with future improvements in the right-of-way, sight distance, or location of public easements.

(6) Separation of Structures. Structures within cottage housing developments shall observe minimum setbacks from other cottage housing development structures to avoid overcrowding the site and to maintain a sense of privacy within the cottages themselves.

(a) All buildings within a cottage housing development shall maintain a minimum separation of 10 feet from cottages within a cottage housing development measured from the nearest point of the exterior walls. Accessory buildings (clustered parking area or multipurpose room – club/meeting house) shall comply with building code requirements for separation from non-cottage structures.

(7) Off-Street Parking Requirements. Off-street parking space requirements for cottage housing developments shall be less than normally required for detached single-family residences. These reduced standards are based upon the cottages being smaller than average detached single-family homes on average and containing fewer occupants. Off-street parking shall be located and designed to be less visible from frontage streets than the cottages themselves. Off-street parking shall be designed to maintain a pedestrian character for the overall cottage housing development. Clustering parking to the side or rear of a cottage project will most often best accomplish these goals. Parking areas shall be attractively landscaped to screen parking from adjacent properties and street rights-of-way and shall meet applicable parking lot landscape standards.

Parking lots shall not be located between the cottage housing development and the primary street frontage.

(i) Off-Street Parking Screening. Off-street parking may be located in or under a non-cottage parking structure (such as a single or multi-auto carport or garage), but such structures shall not be attached to individual cottages. Uncovered parking is also permitted; provided, that off-street parking is screened from direct street view from all abutting street faces.

(ii) Parking Lot Landscaping. Screened from public streets and adjacent residential uses by landscaping and/or masonry wall. Solid board fencing shall not be allowed as an architectural screen.

(8) Exterior Lighting and Heating/Cooling Equipment Noise. Cottage housing developments to be designed to minimize light impacts both within the development and to adjacent properties. Where provided, exterior lighting shall be mounted as low as possible, pointed downward, and the light source shall be shielded from direct observation from above, adjacent properties, and public rights-of-way.

(9) Fences.

(a) Chain link fences shall not be permitted.

(b) Fences are limited to 36 inches adjacent to the common open space.

(10) Alternative Design. The director shall have the authority to review and approve a proposed alternative design that meets the intent and purpose of this chapter. (Ord. 1634 § 1 (Exh. A), 2009)


18.45.080 Common open space.

Open space that is commonly owned by all residences of a cottage housing development is an important feature of any site design. It is intended that the open space be adequately sized and centrally located with individual cottage entrances oriented toward the open space.

18.48.010 Purpose and intent.

The city council finds that orderliness, beauty, architectural harmony, and design with nature in mind bear a substantial relationship to community welfare. The regulations in this chapter promote the maintenance of existing natural areas and the reestablishment of vegetation for aesthetic and health reasons, establish a pleasant visual character by softening the effects of built and paved areas, promote compatibility between land uses by reducing impacts of development on abutting uses, and enhance the livability of residential lands. The city council intends to upgrade the aesthetic character, and ensure the compatibility of institutional, multiple-family residential, commercial, industrial and other developments through the application of screening requirements for outdoor storage uses, maintenance and replanting of natural buffers between incompatible uses, the reservation of sufficient open space, and the installation of landscape strips along street rights-of-way, within parking lots and along side property lines, as more fully set forth in this chapter and other chapters of this title. (Ord. 1474 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.48.020 Outdoor storage screening and other standards.

Outdoor storage areas shall meet the following requirements:

18.48.060 Natural buffers required.

New development or additions and expansions of existing development shall provide buffers along property lines consistent with the screening and buffering requirements as specified in Table 18.48-1. If a new development or addition and expansion of existing developments occur that are abutting a lower intensity use a B3 buffer is required, even if both uses are within the same zone district. (Ord. 1793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1474 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1264 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)

18.48.075 Buffer standards.

(1) B1 – Low Screen Buffer. This buffer is intended to provide a minimal amount of transitional screening between potentially incompatible zones. This buffer consists of live ground cover or bioretention facilities and trees planted every 30 lineal feet on center. Where bioretention facility design interferes with tree spacing requirements, spacing may be modified to accommodate the bioretention facility so long as the total number of trees planted in the buffer is equal to the number otherwise required by the standard. Bioretention plants shall be selected from the city’s bioretention plant list.

(2) B2 – Medium Screen Buffer. This buffer is intended to provide a moderate degree of transitional screening between potentially incompatible zones and uses. This buffer consists of live ground cover or bioretention facilities and trees planted every 30 lineal feet on center, filled between with evergreen shrubs which reach a minimum height of four to six feet within three years of planting. Bioretention facilities within this buffer shall meet the intent of the screen. Where bioretention facility placement interferes with tree and shrub spacing requirements, spacing may be modified to accommodate the bioretention facility so long as the total number of trees planted in the buffer is equal to the number otherwise required by the standard. Bioretention plants shall be selected from the city’s bioretention plant list.

(3) B3 – High Screen Buffer. This buffer is intended to provide a high degree of visual screening between potentially incompatible zones and uses. This buffer consists of six-foot-high wooden, brick or stone fully sight-obscuring fence with a landscape strip along the perimeter of the side and rear yards. The landscape area shall be planted with live ground cover and trees planted every 30 lineal feet on center, filled between with evergreen shrubs which reach a minimum height of six feet within three years of planting. Bioretention facilities which meet the intent of the screen may be used in this buffer with approval of the community development director.

(4) Chain link, barbed wire, razor wire, and field fencing are prohibited.

(5) Incompatible zones are commercial or industrial abutting residential zones. Incompatible uses are commercial or industrial abutting residential uses and multifamily abutting single-family uses.

18.56.030    Expansion of nonconforming buildings and structures.

18.56.040    Continuance and discontinuance of nonconforming uses.

18.56.050    Buildings under construction.

18.56.060    Nonconforming signs.


18.56.010 Purpose and intent.

Within the districts established by this title, there exist certain buildings, lots and uses which were lawful before these regulations were adopted but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of these regulations or future amendments. It is the intention of this chapter to permit nonconforming uses to continue and permit expansion of legal nonconforming businesses, subject to full compliance with current development standards. (Ord. 1456 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.56.020 Nonconforming lots of record.

Notwithstanding the limitation imposed by other provisions of this title, any permitted use or building may be erected or established on any single lot of record existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment, as applicable, of these regulations, even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, applicable to the particular district involved; provided, that building setbacks are observed and the lot otherwise conforms to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located. (Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.56.030 Expansion of nonconforming buildings and structures.

A nonconforming building or structure which contains a conforming use may be expanded, enlarged or extended; provided, that any such additions meet the applicable yard requirements, buffer and landscape strip requirements and all other current regulations for the district in which it is located. Legal nonconforming businesses may be expanded, subject to full compliance with current development standards. (Ord. 1456 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.56.040 Continuance and discontinuance of nonconforming uses.

The lawful use of any building, structure, sign or land existing at the time of enactment of these regulations may be continued, subject to the limitations of this section, even though such use does not conform with the use provisions of the district in which it is located, except that a nonconforming use, land containing a nonconforming use, nonconforming principal building, or nonconforming accessory structure such as a sign shall not be:

(1) Changed to another different nonconforming use which increases the degree of nonconformity (i.e., increased density);

(2) Reestablished after vacant for one year;

(3) Expanded, enlarged or extended, unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such use is located although expansions of legal nonconforming businesses are permitted, subject to full compliance with current development standards;

(4) Rebuilt, altered or repaired, after damage exceeding 80 percent of its replacement value at the time of construction, as determined by the records of the county assessor for one year proceeding the damage or destruction, or by the average amount from two building appraisals performed by independent qualified appraisers, at the owner’s expense. However, in the case of residential and residential accessory uses, the owner may rebuild or repair even if the aforementioned damage equals up to 100 percent of its replacement value at the time of destruction. (Ord. 1793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1456 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1264 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1183 § 1, 1995; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.56.050 Buildings under construction.

Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building or structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of the regulations contained in this title. (Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.56.060 Nonconforming signs.

Nonconforming signs shall not be increased in the extent of nonconformity, enlarged, or altered in any such manner, including the addition of illumination. Nonconforming signs shall not be moved or replaced except to bring into complete conformity with Chapter 18.60 WMC.

Messages of nonconforming signs may be changed provided new nonconformities are not created. Nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed within any 12-month period 50 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax purposes) of such signs. (Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)

18.60.005 Purposes.

The city council finds that the manner of the construction, location and maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety and welfare of the people; the safety of the users of the public streets and sidewalks is affected by the number, size, location, lighting and movement of signs that divert attention of such users; the size and location of signs, if uncontrolled, may constitute safety hazards; and uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the community which could undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation and economic growth. The regulations in this chapter are found to be the minimum necessary to achieve these purposes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an effective administrative process for the review and enforcement of these standards to protect and improve the health, safety and welfare, as well as the aesthetic quality of the community. (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000. Formerly 18.60.020)

18.60.100 Nonconforming signs.

Nonconforming signs shall be subject to the conditions set forth below:

(1) A nonconforming sign or sign structure shall not be altered or enlarged in any manner unless such alteration or enlargement would bring the sign into conformity with the signs permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. Provided, the restriction against alteration does not apply to copy or panel changes where the sign area and shape are maintained.

(2) Any nonconforming sign or sign structure shall be maintained with ordinary care. (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)


18.60.110 On-site interference.

The location and structural design of signs shall be such as to not interfere with the safe and efficient use of off-street parking and loading areas, including aisle ways and access driveways, and sight distances on public streets or private streets. (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)


18.60.120 Lighted signs.

Repealed by Ord. 1693. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)


18.60.130 Enforcement.

This chapter shall be enforced through the provisions of Chapter 18.96 WMC (Enforcement). (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)


18.60.140 Removal of signs due to public health or safety hazard.

If the community development director or duly authorized representative finds any sign to be a health or safety hazard, said sign shall be removed immediately. (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)


18.60.150 Abandoned signs.

(1) Any person who owns or leases a sign shall remove such sign copy when either the function has discontinued or the business has discontinued on the site on which the sign is located.

(2) Abandoned signs and all supporting structural components shall be removed by the sign owner or owner of the property where the sign is located within 30 days after abandonment, unless such sign is replaced with a conforming sign. (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)


18.60.160 Billboards.

(1) The city council finds that action is needed, in response to the federal government designation of the Washougal area as a scenic gorge area and the city’s comprehensive plan policies, to prohibit and/or limit the location of the construction of billboards in the city. The prohibitions and limitations in this chapter are in keeping with the city’s interest of enhancing the tourist trade to the city’s scenic corridor commonly known as the “Gateway to the Gorge.” These purposes are only accomplished by prohibiting billboards in most portions of the city, thereby controlling protruding obstructions into one’s field of view within the scenic corridor.

(2) In recognition of the need to have billboards as a form of advertising in Washougal, an area has been set aside where billboards, if erected, pose less of an impediment to the aesthetic value of the city. The area where billboards are permitted is as follows: bounded on the west by the east line of the Sixth Street right-of-way and bounded on the north by the south right-of-way line on “E” Street and bounded on the east by the west right-of-way of Twelfth Street and bounded on the south by the north right-of-way line of Burlington Northern Railroad.

(3) It is unlawful to construct a billboard within the city without first having secured a site plan review approval and subsequent building permit. All billboards shall be designed to conform to the current edition of International Building Codes. An inspection shall be made by the building official, as warranted.

(4) No permit shall be issued to any person to construct a billboard unless such person executes a bond as hereafter provided and pays the required license fee as fixed by ordinance from time to time. Before any permit or business license is issued to any person to construct a billboard, the applicant for such permit or license shall execute to the city, in the penal sum of $10,000 with sureties to be approved by the finance director or his/her designee and conditioned upon the faithful observance of all ordinances of the city relating to or regulating the construction and display of billboards and, further, shall save and keep the members of the public harmless from all damages, injuries, liabilities, losses or judgments that may arise by reason of the construction, erection or maintenance of any billboard and be required to show proof of adequate insurance.

(5) Billboards shall not exceed an overall height of 12 feet from finished grade, maximum horizontal width of 20. All billboards shall be of a single support pole and using a single plane construction (not wedged). No billboard shall be positioned such that any portion of the billboard is less than 20 feet from the respective front property line. Minimum distance between billboards in one direction along one side of the road right-of-way to which it is directed shall be 200 feet. Billboards shall not be illuminated. (Ord. 1693 § 1 (Exh. I), 2011; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1399 § 1 (Exh. A), 2000)

18.64.010 Purpose and scope.

This chapter provides regulations and procedures to guide planned unit development in the city. The provisions of this chapter are also intended to provide the hearing examiner with a basic reference guide in review of and recommendation for approval of planned unit development projects within the city.

This chapter is also intended to implement the city’s comprehensive plan policies regarding infill development by providing for slightly higher densities, to provide opportunities for individual home ownership and variety of housing opportunities, encourage sustainable development, and to allow for the modification of certain regulations as an incentive for urban development of vacant land within existing developed areas. (Ord. 1638 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.015 Procedures.

Applications for planned unit developments shall be processed as a Type III application, except small infill developments consistent with WMC 18.64.070 that consist of nine or fewer lots shall be processed as a Type II, pursuant to WMC 18.94.060. (Ord. 1793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1638 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.020 Permitted uses.

Since planned unit residential developments are permitted in the residential districts, any use permitted within the district where the development is located shall be a permitted use within the development. The development is intended, however, to consist primarily of residential units, either detached or attached or combination thereof.

For planned unit developments consisting of 25 dwelling units or more, in addition to the above uses, multifamily units, as well as incidental retail and other nonresidential uses are encouraged if specifically and selectively authorized as to exact type and size, when integrated into the project by design, and are fully compatible with the residential uses. Uses that are specified as conditional in the district within which the planned unit residential development is located may also be considered as permitted with a planned unit residential development consisting of at least 25 dwelling units. (Ord. 1793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1638 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.030 Dimensional and improvement requirements.

Planned unit developments are exempt from the lot dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. Planned unit developments remain subject to all other subdivision and zoning requirements of the applicable zone.

(1) Minimum Site Area. Except as specifically provided for small infill planned unit developments, the minimum land area required for developments on property undeveloped with buildings and structures shall be two acres.

(2) Maximum Residential Density. The maximum density of a planned unit development shall be 120 percent of the maximum density for the residential district in which it is located. Density standards for a planned unit development shall be based on the gross area of the parent parcel being considered. The average lot size of the development shall not be less than 80 percent of the minimum lot size for the district in which it is located. If townhome lots are proposed, average minimum lot size requirements of the underlying zone do not apply and 2,000-square-foot lots are permitted outright, subject to WMC 18.46.200; however, no lot shall be smaller than 2,000 square feet. For purposes of computing maximum densities or average lot sizes, any lands devoted to approved nonresidential uses shall not be considered. The hearing examiner may find such densities to be incompatible with surrounding and nearby uses in certain instances and shall not be obligated to approve the maximum densities permitted.

(3) Perimeter Building Setback. Planned unit development shall maintain a perimeter yard unencroached upon by buildings or structures of at least 15 feet when any multifamily (i.e., triplex, fourplex, apartment) is adjacent to any R1 district boundary or less intense/density use. The perimeter setback shall be outside of the lot. Open space tracts, wetlands and street widths of 15 feet or more shall serve as the required peripheral yard between residential uses. Planned unit developments shall maintain a minimum peripheral yard of 25 feet, unencroached upon by parking, streets, playgrounds, or other uses, and maintained as a B3 buffer landscape strip or undisturbed natural buffer when any commercial/retail use is adjacent to any residential district or use.

(4) Minimum Open Space Required. Each planned unit development shall provide not less than 10 percent of the total land area as open space. Open space may be designated to provide active or passive recreation or to provide a wildlife habitat.

(5) Landscape Plan and Maintenance Requirements. All common area and open spaces shall be landscaped in accordance with landscaping plans submitted by the applicant and approved as part of the development approval. A landscape plan may not be warranted if the open space will be retained as wildlife habitat.

(6) When two or more attached dwelling units are proposed they shall be developed toward the interior of the tract rather than the periphery to ensure compatibility with existing single-family residences that border the surrounding properties.

(7) Trails and open space within the planned unit development shall be extended to connect with existing and planned trails or open space on or near the site. Trails shall be constructed in accord with the city’s engineering standards. (Ord. 1793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1638 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1584 § 1 (Exh. A), 2007; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.040 Letter of intent required.

Applications for planned unit development shall be accompanied by a letter of intent that includes all information specified as follows:

(1) Total acreage and legal description of the property;

(2) Land use density and intensity (square feet per acre for nonresidential uses);

(3) A development summary describing the number and types of dwelling units, the proposed uses and anticipated number of employees of all nonresidential buildings;

(4) Program for development, including phasing or timing of development;

(5) Basic content of restrictive covenants;

(6) Provisions to assure permanence and maintenance of common open space;

(7) Statements describing the relationship between the proposed planned unit residential development and the city’s subdivision code, zoning code and comprehensive plan;

(8) Source of water supply, method of sewage disposal, and means of drainage and access for the development;

(9) Names, addresses and phone numbers of the property owner(s), developer, survey, engineer, architect or planner, or other professionals involved in the development design. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.050 Submittal requirements.

(1) The applicant shall submit all information for a Type III submittal as set forth in WMC 18.94.050, as well as the following:

(a) For residential PUDs, the applicant shall submit the information required for subdivision submittal pursuant to WMC 17.12.030.

(b) For residential PUDs or mixed-use PUDs, the applicant shall submit the information required for subdivision submittal pursuant to WMC 17.12.030 for the single-family portions of the development, and the information required for site plan review pursuant to WMC 18.88.040 for the multifamily or nonresidential portion of the development.

(c) In addition to the information required in subsection (1)(a) or (b) of this section, the following additional information and fees shall be submitted with any application for a PUD:

(i) A table of summary data that indicates the following:

(A) Compliance with overall density standards for the project, and housing types (i.e., townhomes, cottage homes);

(B) Ratios of development density to open space proposed; and

(C) Compliance with parking requirements, as applicable;

(ii) A traffic study, if required and pursuant to Chapter 18.90 WMC;

(iii) Fee as identified in WMC 3.90.010. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1245 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.060 Criteria.

In approving a PUD, the hearing examiner shall find that all of the following conditions exist:

(1) The proposed PUD:

(a) The proposed PUD incorporates a unique development design which furthers the specific policies of the comprehensive plan, incorporates stormwater low impact development principles of soil and vegetation retention and impervious surface reduction, or provides a public amenity (such as parks or open spaces) that would otherwise not be provided by the governing agency;

(b) The proposed PUD incorporates design elements that assure protection of or compatibility with existing, adjacent established neighborhoods;

(c) The proposed PUD is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan;

(d) The proposed PUD is consistent with the standards identified at WMC 18.64.020, Permitted uses. (Ord. 1821 § 1 (Att. A), 2016; Ord. 1638 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1475 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.64.070 Incentives for small infill developments.

A development consisting only of residential uses shall qualify as a small infill planned unit development if the property to be developed does not exceed two acres and is surrounded on at least three sides by developed residential properties.

Small infill planned unit developments must meet the provisions in this chapter relative to dimensional and improvement requirements, with the following exceptions: minimum open space shall not be required. Infill developments must meet all approval procedures, and submittal of a letter of intent is required. However, because such infill planned unit developments are of small scale, a detailed development plan with all the information specified for development plans is not necessarily required. It is likely that exclusively single-family residential developments will only require a standard subdivision plat as a development plan. Infill PUDs shall be processed in that manner described in Chapter 18.94 WMC for the land division.

While applicable public notification and hearing requirements shall not be waived, the community development director shall endeavor to expedite the review and approval of small infill planned unit developments where possible, through timely pre-application conferences and public hearings for consideration by the hearing examiner at the earliest possible dates.

*Prior history: Ords. 1167 and 1193.


18.72.010 Purpose.

In certain districts, conditional uses may be permitted, subject to the granting of a conditional use permit. Because of their unusual characteristics, or the special characteristics of the area in which they are to be located, conditional uses require special consideration so that they may be properly located with respect to the objectives of this title and their effect on surrounding properties. The conditional use permit process is not intended to be used to allow uses in areas where uses are otherwise excluded; the intended purpose is to allow in certain districts expressly specified uses, which might otherwise be excluded if not for the possibility, created by the conditional use process, of close scrutiny and regulation by the hearing examiner. To ensure this limitation on the operation of the conditional use permit process, conditional uses specified elsewhere in this title are to be interpreted narrowly. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.020 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any use listed as conditional in any zoning district. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.025 Minor conditional use.

A minor conditional use includes such items as day care centers, bed and breakfast establishments and similar uses as determined by the community development director or designee or expansion or alteration of existing conditional uses by less than 10 percent of the square feet beyond the existing building and structure.

A minor conditional use permit shall be processed the same as a major conditional use permit (Type III). (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003)


18.72.030 Application submittal requirements.

The applicant shall submit all information required for a Type III submittal as set forth in WMC 18.94.050, as well as the following:

(1) A site plan, prepared pursuant to WMC 18.88.030(2)(f), which depicts the proposal in relation to surrounding uses;

(2) A written statement addressing the following:

(a) How the proposal meets all of the criteria in WMC 18.72.060,

(b) How the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan,

(c) Any specific proposed mitigation measures that will assure compatibility with surrounding uses and the general neighborhood;

(3) A traffic study pursuant to Chapter 18.90 WMC;

(4) Other such information as may be required by the director;

(5) Fees as identified in WMC 3.90.010. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1245 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.040 Procedures.

Conditional use permit request shall be processed as a Type III application, pursuant to WMC 18.94.060. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.060 Criteria to consider for conditional uses.

In order to grant any conditional use, the hearing examiner must find that the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use applied for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be significantly detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use or be detrimental or injurious to the property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city.

In reviewing and acting upon conditional uses, the hearing examiner shall consider whether any specific requirements for the conditional use have been made as specified elsewhere in this title, and in addition shall consider the following as appropriate:

(1) Access to the site is appropriate considering the anticipated volume of traffic resulting from the use;

(2) Off-street parking and loading facilities are adequate in terms of location, amount and design to serve the use;

(3) The number, size and type of signs proposed are compatible with the surrounding area;

(4) The amount and location of open space and the provision of screening is such that buffering of incompatible uses is achieved;

(5) The location and intensity of outdoor lighting is such that it does not cast light on adjacent, adjoining or neighboring properties;

(6) Hours and manner of operation of the proposed use will not conflict with the adjacent or nearby uses;

(7) Public facilities and utilities are capable of adequately serving the proposed use;

(8) The proposed use will not have a significant adverse effect on the health, safety and general welfare and character of adjacent land uses or the general area;

(9) The physical conditions of the site, including size, shape, topography and drainage, are suitable for the proposed development;

(10) The proposed use is consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan;

(11) Whether all pertinent and applicable laws have been met as contained in the RCW, the WAC and this code, together with all applicable federal laws;

(12) Any other factors deemed relevant to the community development director or the hearing examiner. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.070 Action by the hearing examiner.

In permitting a conditional use the hearing examiner may impose, in addition to regulations and standards expressly specified in this title, other conditions found necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood, or the city as a whole, if supported by findings of fact. These conditions may include requirements increasing the required lot size or yard dimensions, increasing street widths, controlling the location and number of vehicular access points to the property, increasing the number of off-street parking or loading spaces required, limiting the number of signs, limiting the coverage or height of buildings because of obstructions to view and reduction of light and air to adjacent property, limiting or prohibiting openings in sides of buildings or structures or requiting screening and landscaping where necessary to reduce noise and glare and maintain the property in a character in keeping with the surrounding area, and requirements under which any future enlargement or alteration of the use shall be reviewed by the city and new conditions imposed.

Approval of a conditional use, with the accompanying site plan and any conditions of approval thereof, shall constitute site plan review and approval as required by Chapter 18.88 WMC. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.075 Validity.

A conditional use permit shall become void one year after approval, or after such greater or lesser time as may be specified as a condition of approval, unless within that time the required building construction, alteration or enlargement has been commenced and diligently pursued, or if no such construction, alteration, or enlargement is required, unless the permitted activity is being regularly conducted on the premises. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.080 Appeal.

Repealed by Ord. 1496. (Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.090 Effect.

No building or other permit shall be issued in any case where a conditional use permit is required by the terms of this title until the appeal period of the hearing examiner’s decision has elapsed. An appeal from an action of the hearing examiner shall automatically stay the issuance of a building or other permit until such appeal has been completed. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.72.100 Revocation.

The hearing examiner may revoke any conditional use permit for noncompliance with conditions set forth in the granting of a permit after first holding a public hearing and giving notice of such hearing as provided in Chapter 18.94 WMC. The foregoing shall not be the exclusive remedy, and it is unlawful and punishable hereunder for any person to violate any condition imposed by a conditional use permit. Violations shall be enforced as provided in Chapter 18.96 WMC, Enforcement. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

18.74.050    Exceptions and conditional uses.


18.74.010 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to set forth the regulations which address the use compatibility and aesthetic impacts of wireless communication facilities within the city so as to preserve the integrity of existing neighborhoods and ensure continuity of the constructed landscape throughout the city while preserving the ability for wireless communication providers to establish and maintain a network of communication facilities that serve the greater metropolitan area. Further, it is the purpose of this chapter to outline the regulations supplemental to Chapter 5.60 WMC regarding franchising and cable, fiber-optic and other hardwired telecommunication facilities consistent with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. (Ord. 1234 § 1, 1997)


18.74.020 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all telecommunication facilities, wireless and hardwired, within the corporate limits of the city’s corporate limits. (Ord. 1234 § 1, 1997)


18.74.030 Definitions.

The following definitions apply to this chapter only:

“Co-location” means the location of a new micro-facility on an existing monopole, lattice tower, building or other support structure which does not require enlargement or alteration of that structure, except as necessary to enhance the structural strength of the structure to support the micro-facility.

“Dish antenna” or “parabolic antenna” means a satellite dish type antenna that sends and receives signals in a point to point pattern. A dish antenna is typically no more than six feet in diameter.

“Equipment shelter” means a new, independent enclosure that houses the electronic equipment associated with a wireless communication facility.

“Lattice tower” means a singular support structure, freestanding or guyed, constructed of multiple pieces of metal that form an interlocking lattice and affixed to a foundation, typically of concrete, used to support the installation of wireless communication antennas.

“Lease area” means the finite area of the parent parcel upon which a wireless communication facility, including equipment shelters, is located.

“Micro-facility” means an antenna or group of antennas of the same or differing type (i.e., omni-directional, parabolic dish and panel), that are co-located on an existing tower, building or other appurtenance.

“Monopole” means a singular support pole of relatively uniform diameter constructed in sections or of a single piece of material (wood or metal) and affixed to a foundation, typically of concrete, used to support the installation of wireless communication antennas.

“Omni-directional antenna” means a whip type antenna that sends and receives signals in a 360-degree pattern. An omni-directional antenna is typically no more than four inches in diameter at its base and no greater than 16 feet in height.

“Uni-directional antenna” or “panel antenna” means single or multiple antennas that are of the same type and similar size that together function as a sending or receiving antenna in a directional pattern.

“Wireless communication” means the hardware and technology representing two-way wireless telecommunication including, but not limited to, cellular telephone, digital wireless telephone, enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR) and personal communication service (PCS).

“Wireless communication facility” means any facility erected or installed to provide or aid in the establishment and provision of wireless telecommunication. (Ord. 1234 § 1, 1997)


18.74.040 Wireless facility locational criteria and procedure.

The following sets forth the location and permitting process for each type of facility:

(1) Generally. Generally, wireless telecommunication facilities shall co-locate whenever technically feasible so as to minimize the aggregate aesthetic and use incompatibility impact of multiple towers throughout the city or in localized portions of the city.

(2) Micro-Facility. Co-located micro-facilities shall be permitted outright in any zone, subject only to the applicable provisions of the International Building Code (IBC) and the following conditions:

(a) Micro-facilities shall not be located on single-family structures which sole use is residential.

(b) Micro-facilities co-located on an existing building shall be painted or finished in a manner that is most consistent with the adjacent siding of the building so as to provide the least visual impact to the existing structure and surrounding area.

(c) If located on an existing building, micro-facilities shall be placed in such a manner so as to minimize the visibility of the facility via a direct line of sight from a commonly used public pedestrian or auto right-of-way. This may be accomplished through provision of screening or location on the existing building.

(3) Monopoles and Lattice Towers. Except as provided for in WMC 18.74.050, new monopoles shall be permitted as a Type II site plan review only in the institutional (IP), highway commercial (CH), light industrial (LI) and heavy industrial (HI) zone, as well as on the same site as an existing public utility element (i.e., water towers). New lattice towers shall only be permitted in the heavy industrial (HI) zone or on the same site as an existing public utility element (i.e., water towers) as a Type II site plan review. All new wireless communication facilities, in any zone, shall be subject to the following criteria:

(a) The new facility shall be located a distance of one and one-half times the height of the tower away from the nearest right-of-way line of State Route 14 (SR 14). This requirement may be modified based upon visual mitigation measures proposed by the applicant that significantly decrease the visibility of the facility from travelers on SR 14.

(b) The facility shall be designed to accommodate at least one other co-located micro-facility.

(c) The base of the facility and associated equipment shelters shall be screened with a six-foot tall fully sight-obscuring fence.

(d) The outside perimeter of the screen fencing shall be landscaped with evergreen trees or shrubs that are at least eight feet tall at the time of initial planting, and reach a mature height of at least 25 percent of the height of the tower or 30 feet, whichever is greater, within 10 years of the time of planting. This requirement may be modified or waived if the subject site is surrounded by or in immediate proximity to unaffected uses or adequately screened by existing protected vegetation.

(e) The facility shall not be lit except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration.

(f) New towers and associated equipment shelters may be located in required side and rear setbacks adjacent to land located in the same district as the subject site, except residential districts.

(g) The height of new support structures shall not exceed two times the maximum height of the underlying zone. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1234 § 1, 1997)


18.74.050 Exceptions and conditional uses.

(1) Generally. Location of all new wireless telecommunication facilities shall abide by the applicable provisions of WMC 18.74.040, unless the applicant demonstrates the following to the satisfaction to the director:

(a) That, through technical evidence, such restrictions represent a barrier to entry into the market area or to expand service in the market area as licensed by the FCC. Such evidence shall include, but is not limited to, the following:

(i) Restriction to the permitted zone geographically or topographically prohibits establishment of an effective service area as authorized under the license granted the carrier by the FCC. The applicant shall submit maps of signal strength coverage, existing system component location and other information to demonstrate this,

(ii) There is no land available in the permitted zone due to refusal from individual property owners or documented physical constraints on any available property that would prohibit location of a new facility;

(b) All technically feasible co-location opportunities have been exhausted.

(2) If an applicant has adequately demonstrated that an exception is warranted, the proposed facility shall be permitted in the following manner:

(a) Monopoles shall be permitted in the following zones, in the hierarchical order they are listed, with eligibility for each subsequent zone permitted only after the exemption criteria in subsection (1) of this section are met:

(i) Community commercial (CC) and convenience commercial (CV) zones as a conditional use (Type III), only after demonstrating that the exception criteria in subsection (1) of this section have been met.

(ii) In the AR-16, AR-22, R1-5, R1-7.5 and R1-10 residential districts only as a conditional use (Type III), and only after demonstrating that the exception criteria in subsection (1) of this section have been met for the CC and CV zones.

(iii) If a monopole is permitted outside of a CH, LI or HI zone, it shall be subject to the siting criteria listed in WMC 18.74.040(3) in addition to any condition imposed by the hearings examiner as authorized by Chapter 18.72 WMC.

(3) Lattice towers shall not be permitted outside the HI zone, except when the applicant demonstrates that use of a lattice tower will have a less negative physical or aesthetic impact on the surrounding neighborhood or land uses. (Ord. 1793 § 1 (Exh. A), 2016; Ord. 1234 § 1, 1997)

*Prior history: Ords. 1167 and 1193.


18.80.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for differing levels of relief from some of the numerical standards provided for in the zoning code, such as lot width, depth, area, coverage and setback requirements when they create a hardship that is not borne by other parcels under the same circumstances. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.80.020 Levels of variances.

For the purposes of this title, variances are classified into two levels, administrative and full variance.

(1) Administrative Variance. An administrative variance may provide relief from up to 25 percent of any numerical value contained in this code, except lot size and density, subject to the following applicable thresholds:

(a) Front, Side and Rear Yard Setback. Front, side and rear yards may be reduced by a maximum of five feet or 25 percent, whichever is less.

(b) Height. Height may be exceeded by a maximum of five feet or 25 percent, whichever is less.

(c) Lot Coverage. Lot coverage may be exceeded by 500 square feet or 25 percent, whichever is less.

(2) Full Variance. A full variance may provide relief beyond 25 percent of any numerical standard, except lot area and density. (Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.80.030 Procedures.

(Ord. 1496 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1454 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.80.040 Criteria.

(1) Administrative Variance. The community development director may approve an administrative variance(s) if, based on substantial evidence in the record, the applicant has sustained the burden of proving the variance(s) complies with all of the following:

(a) Granting the variance(s) will not substantially detract from the livability or appearance of a residential area or from the desired character of a nonresidential area, or the variance(s) will substantially enhance the livability or appearance of a residential area or the desired character of a nonresidential area, such as by preserving or protecting significant natural, scenic, historic, cultural, open space or energy resources; and

(b) If variances to more than one regulation are being requested, the cumulative effect of the variances shall be consistent with the purpose of the zone in which the site is situated; and

(c) Adverse impacts resulting from the variance(s) are mitigated to the extent practical; and

(d) The variance(s) does not substantially impair or impede the availability or safety of access that would otherwise exist for vehicles or for pedestrians, or alternative access is provided; and

(e) The need for the variance is not the result of a self-imposed hardship; and

(f) The granting of a variance is based upon functional considerations rather than an economic hardship.

(2) Full Variance. The hearing examiner may grant a variance only after consideration and adoption of findings of fact that all of the following conditions exist and criteria are met:

(a) Unusual circumstances or conditions apply to the property and/or to the intended use that do not apply generally to other property in the same vicinity or district; and

(b) Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant possessed by the owners of other properties in the same vicinity or district; and

(c) The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which property is located; and

(d) That the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the realization of the comprehensive plan; and

(e) The need for the variance is not the result of a self-imposed hardship; and

(f) The granting of a variance is based upon functional considerations rather than an economic hardship.

(3) Simultaneous Variance Request. Where a simultaneous request for a variance has been made, the hearing examiner may grant or deny variances. In acting upon such variance applications, the hearing examiner shall follow procedures and apply such criteria as specifically required in this chapter. (Ord. 1637 § 1, 2009; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh.

18.88.010 Purpose.

The purpose of site plan approval is to ensure compatibility between new developments, existing uses and future developments in a manner consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan in order to create healthful and safe conditions. Site plan approval is required according to the provisions of this chapter in order to promote developments that are harmonious with their surroundings and maintain a high quality of life for area residents; to ensure that new developments are planned and designed to protect privacy, to determine appropriate lighting and noise mitigation measures, and to ensure adequate and safe access. Site plan approval is required for all developments as specified in this title. (Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.88.015 Applicability.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all change of use either to a structure or land, apply to all new construction, expansion or alteration which requires a building or planning permit or results in a change in the use of land. No use shall be established, no structure erected or enlarged, and no other improvement or construction undertaken except as shown upon an approved plan which is in conformance with the requirements set out in this title. (Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.88.020 Procedures.

Except for exempt activities as defined in WMC 18.88.025, site plan reviews shall be classified and processed as follows:

(1) Type I Land Use Action. These reviews are typically relatively minor in nature, consistent with the zoning and surrounding land uses, and do not have a substantial impact on the natural and built environment. The following are classified as Type I site plan reviews:

(a) New construction or expansions of existing construction which do not exceed:

(i) Six thousand square feet of new floor area;

(ii) Twenty new parking spaces;

(iii) Six new multifamily residential units, except as provided for in WMC 18.88.025;

(iv) Building permits.

(2) Type II Land Use Action. These types of reviews are typically more substantial in nature and may have potential incompatibility with surrounding zoning or land uses or may have a more substantial impact on the natural and built environment. The following are classified as Type II site plan reviews:

(a) Any development which is not listed as a Type I site plan in subsection (1) of this section or listed as exempt under WMC 18.88.025;

(b) Any development subject to SEPA pursuant to WMC Title 16, Environmental Regulations;

(c) Any development subject to provisions of Chapter 18.90 WMC, Transportation Concurrency;

(d) Any development located on a parcel which abuts a contrasting zone, as follows:

(i) Any multifamily designation which abuts a single-family designation and is not listed as a Type I action,

(ii) Any industrial designation which abuts any commercial designation, or vice versa,

(iii) Any commercial zone which abuts any residential zone,

(iv) Any industrial zone which abuts a residential zone.

(3) Binding Site Plan Review. Binding site plans shall be processed as a Type II land use action. A binding site plan functions as an alternative to dividing commercial or industrial property through the platting process by designating a specific use and configuration and binding that to the site through a restrictive covenant. A binding site plan is required for the following actions:

(a) All developments requiring a conditional use permit require review by the hearing examiner;

(b) Any proposal which involves the division of commercial or industrial property for the purposes of sale, lease or transfer of ownership without completing the platting process pursuant to WMC Title 17 and Chapter 58.17 RCW.

Binding site plans shall be completed consistent with the requirements and provisions of RCW 58.17.035 and this chapter.

(4) If a site plan review is part of an overall application (i.e., PUD or CUP) that is subject to a higher review process, the site plan review shall be considered in conjunction with the overall application. (Ord. 1849 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)


18.88.025 Exemptions.

The following are exempt from the site plan review provisions of this chapter:

(1) Single-family detached, duplex and triplex residential dwellings;

(2) Construction exempt from review under applicable building and fire codes;

(3) Modifications to the interior of an existing structure that does not change the use or the degree of a use;

(4) Proposed preliminary plat land divisions, except planned unit developments pursuant to Chapter 18.64 WMC;

(5) Other development determined by the community development director to be exempt because it does not result in an increase in land use activity or intensity or in an adverse impact. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1233 § 1 (Exh. A), 1997)

18.90.100    Annual updates and tracking.


18.90.010 Purpose. 

It is the purpose of this chapter to assure adequate levels of service on transportation facilities for existing use as well as for new development in the city and to provide adequate transportation facilities that achieve and maintain city standards for levels of service as provided in the comprehensive plan. It is also the purpose of this chapter to ensure that city level of service standards are achieved “concurrently” with development (as required by the Growth Management Act) by approving development applications that would not cause the level of service on transportation facilities to decline below city standards. Applicants for development may propose mitigation measures that will achieve and maintain the city’s standard for level of service. (Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.020 Applicability. 

This chapter applies to development permit applications including subdivisions, short plats, site plans, shoreline development, conditional use and special use permits which have a potential vehicular impact on the level of service of a segment or intersection of any roadway with a comprehensive plan functional classification of residential collector or higher. Except as required by WMC 18.90.070, development applications that generate less than 25 total weekday morning or evening peak hour trips are not subject to concurrency review, but must prepare a transportation analysis to address safety and operational considerations. Development applications that will generate 25 or more total weekday morning or evening peak hour trips are subject to concurrency review and must prepare a transportation impact study. Requirements of a transportation analysis and a transportation impact study are described in WMC 18.90.040. (Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997) 


18.90.030 Determination of applicability. 

(1) At the preapplication stage of the permit application a determination will be made as to what type of transportation study will be required and whether concurrency review is necessary based on the project size, number of trips generated and other potential impacts. The community development director may require additional information, beyond what is required by WMC 18.90.040, to be submitted with the full application.

(2) The development is not required to meet concurrency requirements if the project meets the exemption provisions in WMC 18.90.070.

(3) Concurrency review and test will be conducted when a complete development permit application is submitted to the city. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.040 Transportation analysis and transportation impact study.

(1) Scope and Contents of Transportation Analysis.

(a) The study shall be prepared or certified by an engineer licensed in the state of Washington with expertise in traffic and transportation engineering.

(b) Calculation of morning peak hour, evening peak hour, and daily trip generation in accordance with WMC 18.90.060, even if the application is not subject to concurrency review. Trip generation during other peak hours may also be required if requested by the community development director.

(c) Assignment of site traffic to the surrounding street system for all examined peak hours. Show trip assignment for all intersections to which the development adds 10 or more weekday morning or evening peak hour trips.

(d) Sight distance analysis at all site access points.

(e) Examination of access spacing standards.

(f) Additional information or analysis may be required at the discretion of the community development director.

(2) Scope and Contents of Transportation Impact Study.

(a) All site accesses and any intersection to which the development adds 25 or more peak hour trips shall be included in the study and be subject to all requirements of this section.

(b) The study shall include all items contained in subsection (1) of this section.

(c) Existing peak hour traffic counts at all study area intersections. The counts shall not be more than 12 months old, as measured at the time the application is deemed technically complete.

(d) A level of service analysis based on the latest version of the Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board.

(e) Signal warrant analysis based on warrants in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) if applicable. Particular attention should be given to intersections identified as “future signalized” in the adopted transportation capital facilities plan.

(f) Left- and right-turn lane analysis if applicable.

(g) Crash analysis consisting of the most recent complete three-year crash history. Safety mitigations at intersections shall be identified at any location with a crash rate in excess of one crash per million entering vehicles. Safety mitigations shall be identified for roadway sections where the crash rate is in excess of two and one-half crashes per million vehicle miles.

(3) For comprehensive plan amendments or other land use actions that increase the potential trip generation of a property, a transportation impact study will be required that includes all elements of subsection (2) of this section as well as:

(a) Trip generation calculations that compare the trip generation of the site with a reasonable worst-case development under the current land use regulations to a reasonable worst-case development under the proposed land use regulations.

(b) A full analysis of the study area intersections for conditions 20 years in the future. This analysis shall consider:

(i) Conditions under current land use regulations.

(ii) Conditions under current land use regulations plus the net increase in trip generation resulting from the land use action.

(c) Mitigations shall be proposed for any intersection operational deficiencies that are a result of the potential increase in trip generation.

(4) The community development director may modify the required contents as follows:

(a) The community development director has the discretion to require more or less information and analysis if it is deemed appropriate based on the project’s size and potential impacts. However, such modifications shall be identified at the preapplication stage or as a portion of the determination of technically complete, if the proposal is not subject to a preapplication conference. Additional addenda beyond this identification may be required only if, through the review process, the community development director is made aware of critical LOS problems or transportation safety issues.

(b) The community development director may waive the need for or limit the scope of a transportation impact study level of service analysis by a written determination that potentially affected intersections and arterials and/or collectors:

(i) Will not fall below LOS standards set forth in WMC 18.90.060; or

(ii) Have been adequately analyzed in research or reports available to the city, performed within one year prior to submittal of the application. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.050 Levels of service standards and analysis.

(1) Transportation facilities levels of service standards, as established in the city capital facility plan, are incorporated and adopted by the ordinance codified in this chapter. The level of service standard for signalized intersections is level of service D or better, with all approaches operating with a volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio of less than one. For unsignalized intersections, the critical movement on the stop-controlled approach shall operate at level of service E or better. Level of service F may be acceptable if all of the following are met:

(a) The critical movements operate at a v/c ratio less than one;

(b) Installation of a traffic signal is:

(i) Not warranted; or

(ii) Not recommended as documented in the transportation impact study;

(c) No other capacity improvements are identified that could mitigate the level of service; and

(d) The intersection will operate safely.

(2) Intersections with facilities designated as “Highways of Statewide Significance” (HSS) under HB 1487 (1998 legislation), codified as RCW 47.06.140, shall be exempt from study under transportation concurrency. The HSS was designated by the Transportation Commission through Resolution No. 660 on January 21, 2004. The Legislature concurred and adopted the HSS, including a map and route list through Engrossed House Bill 1433 on March 31, 2004. This does not exempt these intersections from intersection study that may be required under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). (Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.060 Concurrency test.

(1) The community development director shall perform a concurrency test for each application subject to concurrency review.

(2) Applications for preliminary development permits shall be tested in the order that applications are determined by the community development director to be technically complete under Chapter 18.94 WMC. A transportation impact study, as specified in WMC 18.90.040, shall be included with the application for it to be considered technically complete.

(a) Final development permit applications that have been previously reviewed and tested, and have met all requirements for concurrency review as established by this chapter, shall not be subject to concurrency unless it is determined by the community development director that the project has changed substantially, requiring additional concurrency review and testing.

(3) The concurrency test shall be applied only to the specific scope of the development proposal. Applicants shall specify uses, densities and intensities that are consistent with the uses allowed for the property.

(4) In conducting the concurrency test, the community development director shall use standard trip generation rates or equations as set forth in the most recent edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. In using the manual, the community development director shall apply the land use code and trip generation rates or equations that most accurately and realistically portray the anticipated actual trip generation from the development. An applicant may submit a calculation of alternative trip generation rates for the proposed development, which must be completed or certified by an engineer licensed in the state of Washington with expertise in traffic and transportation engineering. The community development director shall review the alternative calculations and make a written determination within 20 business days of submittal as to whether such calculation will be used in lieu of the standard trip generation rates. The community development director shall adjust the trip generation forecast of proposed development to account for transportation strategies proposed by the applicant and accepted by the community development director.

(5) The community development director shall not approve a development application unless transportation facilities meet or exceed the LOS standards for existing uses or the impacts of the proposed development are mitigated to meet concurrency standards.

(a) If the LOS of transportation facilities impacted by the development meets the LOS standard with the impact of the proposed development, the development meets concurrency.

(b) If the LOS of transportation facilities impacted by the development falls below the level of service standard with the impact of the proposed development, the development does not meet concurrency and the applicant shall complete one of the following options:

(i) Propose mitigation measures that would assure concurrency is met for the development. Mitigation may include altering the development design or density, voluntarily arranging for the transportation facilities needed to meet concurrency, or other measures acceptable to the community development director;

(ii) Accept the denial of the development application; or

(iii) Appeal the denial of the application pursuant to the provisions of the Washougal Municipal Code. The community development director shall encumber any available capacity during the appeal.

(6) An existing or resultant LOS below city standards on any leg of an intersection of a city street with a state facility that is not under direct city control shall not result in a denial of the application. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.070 Exemptions from concurrency.

The following applications for a development permit are exempt from the concurrency requirement, and may commence with gaining permit approvals and development without applying for concurrency review, although a transportation analysis may still be required:

(1) Any development that generates less than 25 peak hour trips to any transportation facility. At the discretion of the community development director, the threshold for concurrency review may be lowered to 10 peak hour trips if:

(a) The development contributes more than 10 peak hour trips to a transportation facility that has been identified through previous study as operating at or near the performance standards identified in WMC 18.90.050.

(2) The first renewal of a previously issued, unexpired permit; provided, that substantial progress has been made, as outlined in the applicable sections of WMC Title 17 or 18.

(3) Expansions or phases of projects that were disclosed by the applicant and subject to a concurrency test as part of the original application (i.e., phased development); provided, that concurrency review was conducted for the expansion or subsequent phases. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.080 Provide needed transportation improvements.

(1) The community development director shall coordinate with the public works director to provide for adequate transportation facilities by constructing needed capital improvements and implementing transportation strategies which:

(a) Eliminate level of service deficiencies for existing use;

(b) Achieve level of service standards for anticipated future development and redevelopment caused by previously issued and new development permits; and

(c) Repair or replace obsolete or worn out facilities. Improvements to transportation facilities shall be consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan and the city’s engineering standards; and

(d) Give ranking priority to transportation improvements funded through the capital facilities plan and six-year transportation improvement plan (TIP) that would alleviate LOS deficiencies on facilities serving sites where essential public facilities are funded for construction.

(2) The city shall include in the capital appropriations of its budget, expenditures to meet financial commitments for all transportation improvement projects required to maintain level of service standards, except that the city may omit from its budget any capital improvements for which a binding agreement has been executed with another party to provide the same project in the same fiscal year. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.090 Intergovernmental coordination.

The city may enter into agreements with other local governments and the state of Washington to coordinate the imposition of level of service standards, impact fees and other mitigations for transportation concurrency.

(1) The city may apply transportation standards, fees and mitigations to development in the city that impacts other local governments and the state of Washington. Development permits issued by the city may include conditions and mitigations that will be imposed on behalf of and implemented by other local governments and the state of Washington.



(2) The city may receive impact fees or other mitigations based on or as a result of development proposed in other jurisdictions that impacts the city. The city may agree to accept and implement conditions and mitigations that are imposed by other jurisdictions on development in their jurisdiction. (Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)


18.90.100 Annual updates and tracking.

The public works and planning departments should provide an update or report on transportation concurrency once a year. The city’s traffic information and modeling shall be updated at least once every five years or sooner if the public works director deems it necessary. The update process shall include traffic volumes (for select locations or the entire city), analysis of completion of previously approved development, improvements to transportation facilities, the effect of transportation strategies, and a review of level of service standards compared to planned transportation facility improvements. (Ord. 1542 § 2, 2006; Ord. 1228 § 1, 1997)

Evidence may be in the form of a water right permit from the Washington Department of Ecology, a letter from an approved water purveyor stating the ability to provide water, or another form sufficient to verify the existence of an adequate water supply.

In addition to other authorities, the city may impose conditions on building permits requiring connection to an existing public water system where the existing system is willing and able to provide safe and reliable potable water to the applicant with reasonable economy and efficiency. An application for a water right shall not be sufficient proof of adequate water supply. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.92.030 Adequate sewage disposal method required.

Each applicant for a building permit of a building necessitating sewage disposal shall provide evidence of an adequate sewage disposal for the intended use of the building in compliance with WMC 14.12.010(A) – Public sanitary sewer required inside UGA, Building Permit Issuance. All land divisions within the UGA shall connect to public sewer as a condition of approval in compliance with WMC 14.12.010(B) – Public sanitary sewer required inside UGA, Land Divisions Within UGA. Evidence may be in the form of public approval of a septic tank or letter stating the ability to provide public sanitary sewer service, or another form sufficient to verify the existence of an adequate sewage disposal method. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.92.040 Adequate storm drainage facilities required.

No development site plan (Type II) or binding site plan (Type III) shall be approved by the city unless adequate provisions for stormwater and flood water have been made as approved by the director. Stormwater drainage systems shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewerage system. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1193 § 1 (Exh. E), 1996; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.92.050 Adequate street requirements.

No development shall be permitted unless the development has property frontage or approved access to a public street.

In conjunction with development plan review and approval (Type II development reviews), or binding site plan review and approval (Type III, or conditional uses), the director will evaluate any information submitted by the applicant relating to the development’s impact on the public street system. The director in the absence of such information will evaluate the proposed development’s impact on the surrounding street system based on his own information.

If, in the opinion of the director, the development will cause an impact on existing street facilities of a magnitude sufficient to question the ability of the street system to handle the projected traffic generated by the proposed development (a “significant traffic impact”), the director may request a traffic evaluation to be prepared for the development in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices, at the cost of the applicant. Developments generating more than 1,000 average daily vehicle trips, determined according to standard traffic engineering practices, should be required to address all nearby key intersections.

In cases where a traffic analysis finds that the development will result in the lowering of a level of service for a road or intersection below the planned levels of service standards described in the Washougal comprehensive plan, transportation element, the city may condition the approval of the development on the installation of improvements needed to alleviate any deficiencies in the level of service standard for streets and intersections. Where the traffic analysis indicates a traffic signal will be needed as a result of the traffic generated from the proposed development, a signal meeting approved specifications shall be installed, and the financial responsibility for installation of the traffic signal shall be on the proposed developer and shall be a condition of the development approval. In lieu of the installation the city council may approve the payment of funds sufficient to cover the proportionate share of the cost of the traffic signal based on the proposed development’s proportionate impact; provided, the city is willing to commit to installing the traffic signal on its own initiative within a six-year period from the date any portion of the proposed development is first occupied.

If the director determines that a significant traffic impact from the proposed development is likely, and the applicant fails to submit a traffic evaluation, then the director shall review the applicable provisions of the Washougal comprehensive plan, transportation element. If, in his judgment, the development cannot be accommodated without reducing any street or street intersection levels of service standards as called for in the plan, and the existing capital facilities plan for streets does not include improvements that will correct the deficiency within a six-year period, then he shall deny the development on the basis that transportation concurrency would not be maintained as required by state law. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1193 § 1 (Exh. E), 1996; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.92.060 Alternative travel facilities on certain streets required.

Developments located on properties fronting an arterial or collector street, as defined by the Washougal comprehensive plan, transportation element, shall be required to install sidewalks along the entire portion of the arterial and collector street rights-of-way of the subject property as a condition of development approval.

On-street bicycle lanes may be required as a condition of approval for developments located on properties with frontage on arterial and collector streets that are designated as bicycle routes in the Washougal comprehensive plan.

Developments containing 500 feet or more of property frontage streets which are designated transit routes of the Clark County public transportation system may be required, where appropriate, to incorporate bus pull-outs and shelters into the site design. In determining the applicability of this provision, the standard of one bus pull-out for each 1,500 feet shall be used. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1167 § 1, 1995)


18.92.070 Other improvements.

All developments (residential, commercial, or industrial) shall meet all the improvement requirements referred to in Chapter 17.36 WMC and the current Washougal Engineering Standards. (Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1437 § 1, 2002)

18.94.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to combine and consolidate the application, review and approval processes for land development in the city in a manner that is clear, concise and understandable. It is further intended to comply with state guidelines for combining and expediting development review and integrating environmental review and land use development plans. Final decision on development proposals shall be made pursuant to the time lines set forth in WMC 18.94.130. (Ord. 1503 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1, 1997)


18.94.020 Applicability.

(1) The provisions of this chapter apply to any action under the following titles of the Washougal Municipal Code:

(a) WMC Title 15, Buildings and Construction;

(b) WMC Title 16, Environmental Regulations;

(c) WMC Title 17, Land Divisions;

(d) WMC Title 18, Zoning.

(2) In addition, this chapter applies to any legislative amendment to the above listed titles. (Ord. 1503 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1, 1997)


18.94.030 Rules of interpretation.

(1) For the purposes of the development code, all words used in the code shall have their normal and customary meanings unless specifically defined otherwise in this code:

(a) Words used in the present tense include the future.

(b) The plural includes the singular and vice versa.

(c) The words “will” and “shall” are mandatory.

(d) The word “may” indicates that discretion is allowed.

(e) The word “used” includes designed, intended, or arranged to be used.

(f) The masculine gender includes the feminine and vice versa.

(g) The word “building” includes a portion of a building or a portion of the lot on which it stands.

(h) All day references refer to calendar days.

(2) Distances shall be measured horizontally unless otherwise specified. (Ord. 1503 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1, 1997)


18.94.035 Application types.

(1) The city shall consolidate the development application and review in order to integrate the development permit and environmental review process, while avoiding duplication of the review processes.

(2) All applications for development permits, site plan review approvals, variances and other city approvals under the development code shall be submitted on forms provided by the community development department. All applications shall be signed by the property owner, or accompanied by a letter of authorization signed by the property owner.

(3) There are four types of land use applications. See Table 18.94-1 for classification of the land use application types. The city shall process each type of land use application as provided in this chapter. The community development director shall classify any application not included on Table 18.94-1, subject to appeal of the classification as part of an appeal of the decision on the merits of the application. Land use applications occur in the following four types:

(a) Type I (Administrative). This application involves no or very little discretionary decision-making in application of the applicable development ordinances, and has little to no significant impact to abutting property owners or the public in general. Examples include boundary line adjustments, building permits and home occupations.

(b) Type II (Administrative). This application type requires a higher degree of discretionary decision-making in interpreting and applying the applicable development regulations, and has a greater degree of impact on abutting property owners and the general public. Examples include short plats, multifamily developments, and commercial and industrial site plans abutting residential zones.

(c) Type III (Quasi-Judicial). This application type requires a high degree of discretionary decision-making in interpreting and applying development regulations, and/or has a high degree of impact on property owners within the vicinity of the site and the public in general. Examples include subdivisions, conditional use permits (CUPs), and planned unit developments (PUDs). A complete classification of the land use application types is found in Table 18.94-1.

(d) Type IV (Legislative). This application has a high degree of impact on property owners within the vicinity of the site and the city as a whole. Examples include comprehensive plan changes and connected rezones, development of regulations and subarea plans, and comprehensive plan reviews. A complete classification of the application types is found in Table 18.94-1.

When a given development or action consists of applications subject to more than one type of review, all of the applications shall be processed concurrently at the highest review type applicable to the applications. (Amended during 9/08 supplement; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1503 § 1, 2005; Ord. 1465 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1451 § 1, 2003; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001; Ord. 1233 § 1, 1997)

(a) Applicant presentation, including submittal of any materials. Members of the hearing body or hearing examiner may ask questions of the applicant;

(b) Staff presentation, including submittal of any administrative reports. Members of the hearing body or hearing examiner may ask questions of the staff;

Such changes may be warranted by ambiguities or conflicts in a decision and by new or more detailed information, permits, or laws. It allows for public notice and input relative to the degree and scope of the proposed changes. The director may approve some de minimis changes without a post-decision review using the final plat/final site plan review process.

(2) Applicability. An applicant who has obtained preliminary approval of a development application, including land division, site plan review, conditional use permit, or planned unit development, may file a post-decision review application requesting a minor change to aspects of the development proposal or conditions of approval.

(d) Post-decision review shall not substantially change the nature of development approved under a given decision.

(e) An application that is denied is not eligible for post-decision review.

(3) Modification of a development other than by a timely appeal or post-decision review shall be through review of a new application; provided, a new application cannot be filed within one calendar year after the date of a decision denying a substantially similar application, unless such earlier decision provides otherwise.

The director may determine that proposed changes exceed the scope of the post-decision review process and that a new development application is warranted. Such determination may be appealed to a hearing examiner in accordance with WMC 18.94.140.

(4) Vesting. Vesting for a proposed development is based on the original development application; provided, that any changes that increase impacts beyond the original development application will be subject to the applicable ordinances in effect on the day that a fully complete post-decision review application is filed.

(5) Classification. The director shall classify the application as subject to a Type I, Type II, or Type III process. This classification decision may be appealed to the hearing examiner in accordance with WMC 18.94.140.

(a) An application for post-decision review of a Type I decision shall be subject to a Type I review process.

(b) An application for post-decision review of a Type II decision shall be subject to a Type I review process, if the director finds that the requested change in the decision:

(i) Is consistent with the applicable law or variations permitted by law, including a permit to which the development is subject;

(x) Does not require further SEPA review.

(c) An application for post-decision review of a Type II decision shall be subject to a Type II review process if it does not qualify for Type I review under subsection (5)(b) of this section.

(d) An application for post-decision review of a Type III decision shall be subject to a Type II review process if the director finds that the requested change in the decision:

(i) Does not increase the potential adverse impact of the development authorized by the decision or SEPA determination;

All violations of this chapter are determined to be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare of the city. All conditions which are determined by the director to be in violation of this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of WMC Titles 15, 16, 17, 18, Washougal Engineering Standards, and conditions of a subdivision or short subdivision plat, site plan, master plan, or shoreline permit and shall be corrected by any reasonable and lawful means as provided herein.

The director shall have the responsibility to render interpretations in order to clarify the application of provisions of the code. Such interpretations shall be in conformity with the intent and purpose of this code. (Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.030 Definitions.

(1) “Abatement” as used in this title shall have the following meaning: the act of elimination or annulment; to become void.

(2) “Commercial/noncommercial ventures” as used in this title shall have the following meanings: any person engaged in the development, management, sale, rental or use of property solely for the purpose of residential occupancy by such person or such person’s immediate family shall be deemed to be engaged in a noncommercial venture. All other persons shall be deemed to be engaged in commercial ventures.

(3) “Director” as used in this title means the community development director, or such other person as the city council shall by ordinance authorize to utilize the provisions of this ordinance and shall also include any duly authorized representative of such director.

(4) “Hearing examiner” as used in this title means the person or board appointed by the city council to hear appeals or any appeal under this title or his duly authorized representative.

(5) “Land disturbing activity” as used in this title means any activity that results in a change to the existing soil cover, both vegetative and nonvegetative, or existing soil topography. Land disturbing activities include, but are not limited to demolition, construction, clearing, grading, dumping, filling, or excavation.

(6) “Building, environmental, land division, zoning ordinance” as used in this title means and includes this title and any other existing or future ordinances or resolutions of the city which regulates the use and development of land or buildings, including but not limited to zoning regulations, environmental regulations, subdivision regulations, short subdivision regulations, land disturbing activity, erosion control and water quality regulations and building, fire and construction codes. It shall also include any existing or future law of the State Legislature which regulates the use of and development of land, including but not limited to the State Subdivision Law, Chapter 58.17 RCW, and the Shorelines Management Act, Chapter 43.51 RCW. This title shall be construed as, and is intended to be enacted as, a regulation adopted pursuant to any such state law and pursuant to Article II, Section 11, Washington State Constitution.

(7) “Person” as used in this title shall include any natural person, organization, corporation or partnership and their agents or assigns. (Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)

(Ord. 1658 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.050 Right of entry.

Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any building, structure, property or portion thereof is being used in violation of this chapter, the director may seek permission to enter such building, structure, property or portion thereof at all reasonable times to inspect the same. If permission to inspect is denied by the owner or person in possession of property, or reasonable attempts to contact the owners or persons in possession are unavailing, the director may apply to the court for an order authorizing entry upon the land for the performance of the inspection.

If the director issues an order of abatement and no appeal is taken from that order or the director prevails on appeal, the director may seek permission to enter the land and undertake abatement. If, however, permission to enter is denied, the director may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for authority to enter the property in order to perform the abatement as provided in the director’s order. (Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.060 Civil penalty.

In addition to or as an alternative to any other judicial or administrative remedy provided herein or by law, any person who violates this chapter, or rules and regulations adopted thereunder, or by each act of commission or omission procures, aids or abets such violation, shall be subject to a civil penalty of $250.00 for the first violation offense, $500.00 for the second violation offense, and $1,000 for the third violation offense. Each calendar day may constitute a new violation. All civil penalties assessed will be enforced and collected in accordance with the lien, personal obligation, and other procedures specified in this title or as authorized by law. (Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.070 Abatement order.

In addition to or as an alternative to any other judicial or administrative remedy provided herein or by law, the director may order a violation to be abated.

The director may order any person who creates or maintains a violation of this chapter, or rules and regulations adopted thereunder, to commence corrective work and to complete the work within such time as the director determines reasonable under the circumstances. The person, subject to the director’s abatement order, shall either complete the corrective work or timely file an appeal pursuant to WMC 18.96.110.

If the required corrective work is not commenced or completed within the time specified, the director may proceed to:

(1) Abate the violation and cause the work to be done, upon receipt, by a court of competent jurisdiction, of an abatement order authorizing the same. The director or designee is expressly authorized to enter the property of the person committing the violation for the purpose of abatement of said violation.

(a) The actual cost of abatement, including incidental costs such as staff time, legal costs, costs of postage and other reasonable costs shall be included as abatement costs.

(b) The finance director will charge the costs thereof as a lien against the property and as both a joint and separate personal obligation of any person who is in violation. All challenges to the reasonableness of the cost charged may be raised at such time as the city of Washougal undertakes a lien foreclosure.

(2) Issue a citation as described in WMC 18.96.150. (Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.080 Commencement of abatement notice and order proceedings.

(2) Pending commencement and completion of the abatement notice and order procedure provided for in this chapter, a director may cause a “stop work order” to be posted on the subject property or served on persons engaged in any work or activity in violation of this chapter. The effect of such a “stop work order” shall be to require the immediate cessation of such work or activity until authorized by a director to resume the work or activity. (Ord. 1658 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.090 Abatement notice and order.

Whenever the director has reason to believe that a violation of WMC Title 15, 16, 17 or 18, Chapter 14.36 WMC, Washougal Engineering Standards, conditions of a subdivision or short subdivision plat, site plan, master plan, shoreline permit, or rules and regulations adopted thereunder will be most promptly and equitably terminated by an abatement notice and order proceeding, the director may issue a written abatement notice and order directed either to the owner or operator of the source of the violation, the person in possession of the property where the violation originates, or the person otherwise causing or responsible for the violation. The abatement notice and order should be issued first against the violator where the violator is not the property owner, e.g., tenant, unless the seriousness of violation demands filing against the property owner. Such abatement notice and order may be issued by any director alone, or, where violations of more than one city ordinance, rule or regulation exists, in conjunction with a notice and order issued by another director. The abatement notice and order shall be posted on the property and shall contain:

(1) The street address when available and a legal description of real property and/or description of personal property sufficient for identification of where the violation occurred or is located;

(2) A statement that a director has found the person to be in violation of WMC Title 15, 16, 17 or 18, Chapter 14.36 WMC, Washougal Engineering Standards, conditions of a subdivision or short subdivision, site plan, master plan, shoreline permit, or public health or that a violation exists on the property, with a brief and concise description of the conditions found to be in violation;

(3) A statement of the corrective action required to be taken. If a director has determined that corrective action is required, the order shall require that all required permits be secured and the work physically commenced within such time and be completed within such time as the director shall determine is reasonable under the circumstances;

(4) A statement specifying the amount of any civil penalty assessed on account of the violation and, if applicable, the conditions on which assessment of such civil penalty are contingent;

(5) Statement advising that:

(a) If any required work is not commenced or completed within the time specified above, a director may proceed to abate the violation as authorized by WMC 18.96.140 and cause the work to be done and charge the costs thereof as a lien against the property and as a joint and separate personal obligation of any person in violation or responsible person who has filed to abate the violation; and

(b) If any assessed civil penalty is not paid, a director will charge the amount of the penalty, and any costs of abatement undertaken pursuant to WMC 18.96.140, as a lien against the property and as a joint and separate personal obligation of any person in violation or failing to abate a violation; and

(6) A statement advising that the order shall become final unless, not later than 10 calendar days after the abatement notice and order are served, any person aggrieved by the order requests in writing an appeal before the hearing examiner.

18.96.100 Method of service.

Service of the abatement notice and order shall be made upon all persons identified in the abatement notice and order either personally or by mailing a copy of such notice and order by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or if the address of any such person cannot reasonably be ascertained, then a copy of the abatement notice and order shall be mailed to such person at the address of the location of the violation and the notice will be posted on the property. The failure of any such person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. Service by certified mail in the manner herein provided shall be effective on the date of mailing. (Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.110 Appeals – Abatement notice and order.

The request shall cite the abatement notice and order appealed from and contain a brief statement of the reasons for seeking the appeal hearing. The method of appeal as provided in this resolution shall be sole and exclusive.

(2) The appeal hearing shall be conducted on the record and the hearing examiner shall have such rulemaking and other powers as were available to the director originally. Such appeal hearing shall be conducted within 60 calendar days after receipt of the request for appeal. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing to each appealing party, to the director whose order is being appealed, and to other interested persons who have requested in writing that they be so notified.

(3) All appeals shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 1-08 WAC, Uniform Procedural Rules; provided, however, that WAC 1-08-590 shall be excluded.

(4) For the purposes of this chapter, all references in the WAC to “agency” shall mean hearing examiner. In addition, the hearing examiner may promulgate and adopt such additional rules as are necessary for the conduct of a hearing.

(5) Each party shall have the following rights, among others:

The written decision of the hearing examiner shall be mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to all the parties.

(7) The appeal hearing before the city of Washougal hearing examiner shall occur within 60 calendar days following receipt of the written notice of appeal unless the matter is continued at the discretion of the hearing examiner.

(8) Whenever possible, the appeal from a director’s abatement order shall be combined with any other appeal from city enforcement actions relating to the same subject matter and falling within the jurisdiction of the hearing examiner. (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.120 Final abatement order.

(1) Any abatement order duly issued by a director pursuant to the procedures contained in this title shall become final 10 calendar days after service of the abatement notice and order unless a written request for hearing is received by the hearing examiner within the 10-calendar-day period.

(2) An order which is subjected to the appeal procedure shall become final 20 calendar days after a mailing of the hearing examiner’s decision unless within that time period an aggrieved person initiates review by writ of certiorari in Clark County superior court. (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.130 Supplemental notice and order – Abatement or citation.

A director may at any time add to, rescind in part, or otherwise modify a notice and order by issuing a supplemental notice and order. The supplemental notice and order shall be governed by the same procedures applicable to all notices and order as contained in this title. (Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)


18.96.140 Enforcement of an abatement or citation final order.

(1) If, after any abatement or citation order duly issued by a director has become final, the person to whom such order is directed fails, neglects, or refuses to obey such abatement or citation order, including refusal to pay a civil penalty assessed under such order, a director may:

(e) Pursue any other appropriate remedy at law or in equity under this title.

(2) Enforcement of any notice and order of a director issued pursuant to this title shall be stayed during the pendency of any appeal under this title, except when a director determines that the violation will cause immediate and irreparable harm and so states in the notice and order issued. Mitigation measures may be imposed by the hearing examiner or director during the pendency of an appeal in superior court to minimize the impact of the alleged violation. Penalties assessed in the notice and order will continue to aggregate during the appeal period unless the appellant prevails on appeal. The aggregated penalty shall not exceed three times the amount of the daily penalty as determined in WMC 18.96.060 for any single violation from its inception through the date the hearing examiner renders its final decision. (Ord. 1740 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013; Ord. 1658 § 1 (Exh. A), 2010; Ord. 1613 § 1 (Exh. A), 2008; Ord. 1421 § 1, 2001)
