Sec. 38-32. - De nitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them
the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.

Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of
this article or a request for a variance.

Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within the city subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as zone A on the flood hazard
boundary map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the
flood insurance rate map (FIRM), zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V.

Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Critical feature means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which
the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised.

Development means any manmade change to improved and unimproved real estate, including, but not
limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations.

Elevated building means a nonbasement building:
(1)
Built, in the case of a building in zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, to have the top of the elevated
oor, or in the case of a building in zones V1-30, Ve or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated oor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers) or
shear walls parallel to the oor of the water; and
(2)
Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a ood of up to the
magnitude of the base ood.
In the case of zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X and D, such term also includes a building
elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate
the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of zones V1-30, VE or V, such term also
includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower
area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the standards of
Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of
construction commenced before the effective of the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) or before January 1, 1975
for FIRMs effective before that date. Such term may also be referred to as "existing structures."

Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from the:
(1)
Over ow of inland or tidal waters.
(2)
Unusual and rapid accumulation or runo of surface waters from any source.

Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of the city on which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency has delineated the boundaries of the flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) related erosion
areas having special hazards have been designated as zone A, M and/or E.

Flood protection system means the physical structural works for which funds have been authorized,
appropriated and expended, and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to
reduce the extent of the areas within the city subject to a special flood hazard and the extent of the depths of
associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes.
Such specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering
standards.

Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any
source (see definition of Flood or flooding).

Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in
accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide
protection from temporary flooding.

Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee and associated structures, such
as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering
practices.

Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or
flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than
a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to
render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.

Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the
required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, such term also includes park trailers, travel trailers
124/428

and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, such
term does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.
State law reference—Similar provisions, Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 5221f, § 3.

Mean sea level means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on the city's flood
insurance rate map are referenced.

New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the effective date of the floodplain management regulation adopted by
the city.

Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal
Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of
piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not as part of the main structure.

Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally
above the ground, as well as a manufactured home.

Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is
started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the
purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not such alteration affects
the external dimensions of the structure. Such term does not, however, include either:
(1)
Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code
speci cations which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
(2)
Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic
places.

Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)

Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's
floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications or evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4) or (e)(5)
of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of
1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
coastal or riverine areas.

Cross reference—Definitions generally, § 1-2.
Sec. 38-33. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The ood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public
expenditures for ood protection and relief, all of which adversely a ect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(b)
These ood losses are caused by the cumulative e ect of obstructions in oodplains which cause an increase in
ood heights and velocities, and by occupancy of ood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to oods and
hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, oodproofed or otherwise protected from
ood damage.

Sec. 38-35. - Methods of reducing ood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods:
(1)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property in times of ood, or which cause
excessive increases in ood heights or velocities;
(2)
Require that uses vulnerable to oods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against ood
damage at the time of initial construction;
(3)
Control the alteration of natural oodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved
in the accommodation of oodwaters;
(4)
Control lling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase ood damage; and
(5)
Prevent or regulate the construction of ood barriers which will unnaturally divert oodwaters or which may
increase ood hazards to other lands.

Sec. 94-240. - Line extension and street cutting fees.
Water and sewer taps will be made for the base tap fee provided the tap is made to a water or wastewater
line abutting or adjacent to the lot or parcel to be served ("standard location"). For the purposes of this article,
a tap made on a water or wastewater line located between the boundary line of the property to be served and
the right-of-way line of the street or alley abutting such lot, or a line located within the right-of-way of such
street between the property boundary line and the traveled, paved portions of the street, shall also constitute
a tap made at a "standard location." A tap made at a "standard location" shall be a "standard connection." A
"non-standard location" is any location for a tap to serve any lot, tract or parcel of land other than at a
standard location. A "non-standard connection" is any tap that requires work, construction or extensions to be

270/428

7/12/2019

Dublin, TX Code of Ordinances

made for the tap, or that is made at other than a standard location. Additional charges and fees shall be
assessed and collected as herein detailed for costs associated with line extensions and taps made to a nonstandard location.
(1)

Availability of service. The existence of mains, trunk lines or other lines, near a property will not constitute an
obligation for the city to limit the tap fee or charge for making a water or sewer service tap to such line, where
such lines must be tapped at other than a standard location, are inaccessible due to necessary crossings of
streets, highways, drainage channels and similar barriers, or when cost must be incurred over and above the
cost for making a tap at a standard location. Taps at non-standard locations must be arranged for with the city
in advance of the desired service date, to permit necessary extensions, crossings or similar construction.
(2)

Installation of nonstandard connection. Upon the approval of the city manager, the owner or development of a
subdivision requiring a non-standard connection may contract with a quali ed contractor for the installation,
construction and extension of any water or sewer line necessary to make a non-standard connection or as
necessary for the location for the tap to become a standard location and, in such event, such owner or
developer shall pay the reasonable costs and charges therefore directly to the contractor and obtain a receipt
and release from said contractor. The city shall otherwise, at the expense of the applicant for the tap, construct
all line extensions and perform all construction required to make a water or sewer tap at a non-standard
location. The city shall inspect such construction and work to assure it is completed in compliance with the
applicable rules and regulations of the city and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality or appropriate
regulatory agency.
(3)

Costs. The reasonable costs and expenses for installing, constructing and extending any water or sewer line of
the city to provide a tap at a non-standard location, or to extend such lines to a standard location, shall be
charged and collected by the city, if such costs are not paid directly by an owner/developer pursuant to (2)
above. Such additional costs and expenses shall be equal to the di erence between the cost of making the tap
at a standard location and the cost of making the tap at the non-standard location, or, as the case may be, the
di erence between the cost of making the tap at a standard location and the costs incurred for the work and
construction to extend the lines to a point or location that is a standard location for the tap.
(4)

Payment of line extension fee. When a water or sewer line extension charge is required, the city may, at its
option require the owner being furnished the line to:
a.
Pay in advance, the estimated costs for construction of the water or sewer line that is estimated to be costs
additional to a standard connection;
b.
Post a bond su cient to cover the total estimated costs of line extension; or
c.
Provide a letter of credit su cient to cover the total estimated costs of the line extension.

structure or use can be amortized within a de nite period of time, taking into consideration the general
character of the neighborhood and the necessity for all property to conform to the regulations of this chapter.

design and placement of buildings, open spaces, circulation patterns and to best utilize special site features,
such as topography, size and shape. It is intended that the flexibility permitted by the PD district extends to
discretionary approval, through site plan review of items such as parking space requirements, building line
setbacks, square footage of buildings and structures, protective screening or sign placement and
specifications in order to achieve the purposes and objectives stated in conformance with good planning
practices. The PD district may also be used either alone or as a suffix to another district to accommodate
planned associations of uses developed as integral land use units, including mixed uses, which may be
planned, developed and operated either by a single owner or a combination of owners.
