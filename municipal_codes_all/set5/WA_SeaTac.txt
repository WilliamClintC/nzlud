C. “Regulation” means and includes any of the following, as now enacted or hereafter amended: all SeaTac Municipal Code provisions; all standards, rules, and procedures adopted by the City that make reference to this chapter; and the terms and conditions of any permit or approval issued by the City.

D. “Repeat violations” means a violation of the same City code in any location by the same person for which code enforcement has been undertaken within two (2) years prior.

F. “Violation” means an act or omission contrary to City code or regulation including an act or omission at the same or different location by the same person and including a condition resulting from such act or omission.

(Ord. 09-1021 § 1 (part): Ord. 01-1006 § 1: Ord. 95-1012 § 1: Ord. 90-1075 § 2: Ord. 90-1048 § 2)


1.15.025 Violations.

A. Violations of the following titles and chapters of the SeaTac Municipal Code shall be remedied in accordance with SMC 1.15.045 through 1.15.075 by way of correction agreement and/or notice of infraction:

D. Monetary Penalties – Environmentally Sensitive Areas. The code compliance provisions for environmentally sensitive areas as codified under Chapter 15.700 SMC are intended to encourage compliance and to protect environmentally sensitive areas and the general public from harm and to further the remedial purposes of this title. To achieve this, persons responsible for code compliance will not only be required to restore damaged or altered environmentally sensitive areas, insofar as that is possible and beneficial, but will also be required to pay a civil monetary penalty for the redress of ecological, recreation, and economic values lost or damaged due to their unlawful action. 

1. The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in lieu of any other penalty, sanction or right of action provided by law for other related violations. 

2. In addition to any other persons who may be responsible for violations occurring within or on environmentally sensitive areas, the owner of the land upon which the violation occurred shall be jointly and severally liable for the restoration of the site and the payment of any civil monetary penalty imposed. 

3. Any person in violation of the environmentally sensitive areas under Chapter 15.700 SMC shall be subject to both the civil monetary penalties set forth in subsection (C) of this section and an amount reasonably determined by the City to be equivalent to:

a. The economic benefit that the person responsible for the violation derives from the violation, as measured by the greater of the resulting increase in market value of the property or the value received by the person responsible for the violation; and/or

b. Savings of construction costs realized by the person responsible for the violation as a result of performing any act in violation of Chapter 15.700 SMC; and/or

c. Reasonable value of property damaged. (Ord. 16-1007 § 4; Ord. 09-1021 § 1 (part): Ord. 05-1001 § 3; Ord. 04-1016 § 1: Ord. 04-1014 § 3: Ord. 01-1006 § 1)

Conviction shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisonment for a term not to exceed ninety (90) days, or both, and each day during which such violation continues shall be considered an additional violation.

B. Extension and Modification. An extension of the time limit for correction or a modification of the required corrective action may be granted by the Code Enforcement Officer if the person responsible for the violation has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting the violation, but unforeseen circumstances delay correction under the original conditions and the responsible person provides the request in writing clearly establishing the need for such an extension.

C. Abatement by the City. The City may abate the violation in accordance with SMC 1.15.175 if the terms of the correction agreement are not met.

(Ord. 94-1007 § 1)

In the event that any official or employee fails or refuses to comply with any of the conditions set forth in Section 2.06.060 of this chapter, or elects to provide his/her own representation with respect to any such claim or litigation, then all of the provisions of this chapter shall be inapplicable, and shall have no force or effect with respect to any such claim or litigation. (Ord. 94-1007 § 1)


2.06.090 Reimbursement of incurred expenses.

A. If the City determines that an official or employee does not come within the provisions of this chapter, and a court of competent jurisdiction later determines that such claim does come within the provisions of this chapter, then the City shall pay any judgment rendered against the official or employee and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in defending against the claim. The City shall pay any costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is covered by the provisions of this chapter; provided, that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such claim does not come within the provisions of this chapter, then the official or employee shall pay the City’s costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in obtaining the determination that such claim is not covered under the provisions of this chapter.

2.06.100 Conflict with provisions of insurance policies.

In the event of any conflict between this chapter and the provisions of any such policy of insurance, the policy provisions shall be controlling; provided, however, that nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to limit or restrict any employee’s or official’s right to full coverage pursuant to this chapter, it being the intent of this chapter to provide the coverage detailed in this chapter only outside and beyond insurance policies which may be in effect while not compromising the terms and conditions of such policies by any conflicting provisions contained in this chapter. (Ord. 94-1007 § 1)


2.06.110 Pending claims.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any claims or lawsuits filed against any official or employee, and any such claims or lawsuits hereinafter filed, irrespective of the date of the events or circumstances which are the basis of such claim or lawsuit. (Ord. 94-1007 § 1)

2.25.010 Definitions.

A. Area Zoning. “Area zoning” is synonymous with the terms “rezoning or original zoning” and means procedures initiated by the City which result in the adoption or amendment of zoning maps on an area-wide basis.

The City Manager shall then determine the amount of shared leave, if any, which an employee may receive, provided, that, no employee shall receive more than a total of one hundred sixty-one (161) days of leave.

All salary payments made to an employee while using shared leave shall be made by the Department to which that employee is assigned.

(Ord. 91-1006 § 5)


2.60.060 Responsibility of the Personnel Department.

The Personnel Department shall be responsible for computing the values of shared leave as donated and as used, and shall provide appropriate information to the Department of Finance to ensure adjusting of accrued leave balances to reflect the shared leave and to permit determination of fund transfers and budget amendments as necessary. An appropriate record of all leave transferred shall be maintained in the event that any unused leave time is returned to the donating employee or employees. (Ord. 91-1006 § 6)

Chapter 2.80 PUBLIC RECORDS

Sections:

2.80.010    Findings.

2.80.020    Public records index – Order – Maintenance not required.

2.80.030    Public records disclosure – Policy.


2.80.010 Findings.

A. Chapter 42.17 RCW requires all cities and public agencies to maintain and make available a current index of various public records.

B. RCW 42.17.260(4) provides that if maintaining such an index would be unduly burdensome, or would interfere with city operations, a city need not maintain such an index but it must issue and publish a formal order specifying the reasons why and the extent to which compliance would be unduly burdensome or would interfere with operations.

C. The City of SeaTac is comprised of numerous departments which maintain separate databases and/or record keeping systems for the indexing of records and information.

D. Because the City has records which are diverse, complex, and stored in multiple locations and in multiple computer systems and databases, it is unduly burdensome, if not physically impossible, to maintain a central index of records.

E. The City produces or receives an uncountable number of records each day, and maintains an uncountable number of records in numerous City files.

F. The development and maintenance of a City index would be extremely costly, and would provide little benefit to the public compared to the expense in maintaining the index.

G. The City’s operations do not allow for the addition, revision, or reassignment of duties of existing personnel so that an index may be developed and maintained.

H. Pursuant to Chapter 42.17 RCW, the City of SeaTac will disclose all public records including all indexes that are maintained by the City, to the extent such records or indexes are available and not exempt from disclosure pursuant to State law or any other applicable law. (Ord. 04-1020 § 1)


2.80.020 Public records index – Order – Maintenance not required.

Based upon the findings set forth in SMC 2.80.010, and pursuant to RCW 42.17.260(4)(a), the City Council orders the following:

A. The following shall constitute violations of this Code of Ethics:

1. General Prohibition against Conflicts of Interest. In order to avoid becoming involved or implicated in a conflict of interest or impropriety, no current elected official should be involved in any activity that is in conflict with the conduct of official City business or is adverse to the interests of the City.

2. Beneficial Interests in Contracts Prohibited. No elected official shall participate in his/her capacity as an elected official in the making of a contract in which she/he has a financial interest, direct or indirect. This shall include any contract for sale, lease or purchase, with or for the use of the City, or the acceptance directly or indirectly of any compensation, gratuity or reward from any other person beneficially interested therein. Provided, however, that this prohibition shall not apply where the elected official has only a remote interest in the contract, and where the fact and extent of such interest is disclosed and noted in the official minutes or similar records of the City prior to formation of the contract, and thereafter the governing body authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract in good faith, by a vote of its membership sufficient for the purpose without counting the vote(s) of the official(s) having the remote interest. For purposes of this chapter, a “remote interest” means:

a. That of a non-salaried officer of a nonprofit corporation; or

No elected official shall influence the City’s selection of, or its conduct of business with, a corporation, person or firm having or proposing to do business with the City if the elected official has a financial interest in or with the corporation, person or firm, unless such interest is a remote interest and where the fact and extent of such interest is disclosed and noted in the official minutes or similar records of the City prior to formation of the contract.

4. Representation of Private Person at City Proceeding Prohibited. No elected official shall appear on behalf of a private person, other than him/herself or an immediate family member, or except as a witness under subpoena, before any regulatory governmental agency or court of law in an action or proceeding to which the City or an elected official in an official capacity is a party, or accept a retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by the City.

5. Certain Employment Prohibited. No elected official shall engage in or accept employment from – or render services for – any interest, when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties or would tend to impair independence of judgment or action in the performance of official duties. However, holding any other elected public office at the same time is a violation of the Ethics Code, regardless of whether the doctrine of incompatible offices is applicable.

6. Beneficial Interest in Legislation Prohibited. No elected official, in appearing before the City Council or when giving an official opinion before the City Council, shall have a financial interest in any legislation coming before the City Council or participate in any discussion with or give an official opinion to the City Council, unless such interest is a remote interest and where the fact and extent of such interest is disclosed and noted on the record of the Council or similar records of the City, prior to consideration of the legislation by the City Council.

7. Disclosure of Confidential Information Prohibited. No elected official shall disclose or use any confidential, privileged or proprietary information, gained by reason of his/her official position, for a purpose which is other than a City purpose; provided, however, that nothing shall prohibit the disclosure or use of information which is a matter of public knowledge, or which is available to the public upon request.

8. Concealment of Public Records Prohibited. No elected official may intentionally destroy public records, or conceal a record if the elected official knew the record was required to be released under the Public Records Act, was under a personal obligation to release the record, and failed to do so.

All emails sent or received from a non-City email account related to City business must be preserved pursuant to City records retention policies.

10. Improper Use of Position Prohibited. No elected official shall knowingly use his/her office or position to secure personal benefit, gain or profit, or use his/her position to secure special privileges or exceptions for him/herself, or for the benefit, gain or profits of any other persons.

12. Improper Use of City Property Prohibited. No elected official shall use City owned vehicles, equipment, materials, money or property for personal or private convenience or profit.

The City Attorney may communicate with the subject of the complaint and/or the City Council to provide advice and/or counseling so that such a violation, even if true, could be prevented in the future.

3. Make a preliminary determination that the facts stated in the complaint, if true, could potentially constitute a violation of the Code of Ethics such that further proceedings are warranted.

Throughout the process, the Hearing Examiner may seek legal advice from the City Attorney or other legal counsel as assigned by the City Attorney.

If the complainant is a City employee, he or she may additionally be subject to disciplinary action. (Ord. 16-1013 § 1 (part))1

1. The complaint must be based upon facts within the personal knowledge of the complainant;

2. The complaint must be submitted in writing and signed under oath by the complainant and filed no more than one (1) year from the date of the alleged violation;

3. The complaint must include a detailed factual description of the alleged violation including the date, time and place of each occurrence and the name of the person or persons who are alleged to have committed a violation. The complaint must also refer to the specific provisions of the code of ethics which are alleged to have been violated;

4. The complaint must be accompanied by all available documentation or other evidence known to the complainant to support the allegations of the complaint.

B. No person shall knowingly file a false or frivolous complaint, or a false or frivolous report of violation of this Code of Ethics.

After reviewing the complaint, the City Attorney may take any of the following actions and inform the complainant, the subject of the complaint, and the City Council as appropriate:

1. Determine that the facts stated in the complaint, even if true, would not constitute a violation of the Code of Ethics, and that no further action is warranted.

2. Determine that the facts stated in the complaint, even if true, would not constitute a material violation of the Code of Ethics because any potential violation was inadvertent or minor or has been adequately cured, such that further proceedings on the complaint would not serve the purposes of the Code of Ethics. The City Attorney may communicate with the subject of the complaint and/or the City Council to provide advice and/or counseling so that such a violation, even if true, could be prevented in the future.

3. Make a preliminary determination that the facts stated in the complaint, if true, could potentially constitute a violation of the Code of Ethics such that further proceedings are warranted.

4. The initial determination shall be documented in writing within fifteen (15) days of its receipt of the complaint, unless a longer time is deemed warranted by the City Attorney based on particular circumstances. The City Attorney’s initial determination is final.

D. The individual designated to conduct the investigation shall complete the investigation and prepare written findings, conclusions, and recommended disposition as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days of the date of the initial determination unless an extension is granted by the City Attorney. A copy of the written investigation findings and conclusions shall be provided to the City Attorney.

E. Within five (5) business days of receipt of the investigator’s written findings, conclusions, and recommended disposition, the City Attorney shall forward a copy to the City’s Hearing Examiner.

F. Within ten (10) business days of receipt of the investigator’s report, unless a longer time is approved by the City Attorney, the Hearing Examiner shall consider and review the complaint, findings, conclusions and recommended disposition. If the Hearing Examiner determines that more information is needed to make a determination as to whether the Code of Ethics has been violated, it may request additional documentary evidence or convene a hearing to gather such additional evidence as required. After final deliberations on the complaint, investigator’s findings, as well as any additional testimony, statements, or documents presented at the hearing, if any, the Hearing Examiner shall determine whether or not a violation of the Code of Ethics has occurred. Throughout the process, the Hearing Examiner may seek legal advice from the City Attorney or other legal counsel as assigned by the City Attorney.

G. If the Hearing Examiner determines that a violation of the Code of Ethics has occurred, it may, but is not required, to recommend penalties be imposed for the violation.

H. Copies of the written findings of fact, conclusions and recommended disposition of the Hearing Examiner shall be forwarded to the complaining party and the subject of the investigation and the City Council. Additional copies shall be forwarded to the investigator and the City Attorney.

I. If the Hearing Examiner determines that a violation of the Code of Ethics occurred, the Council shall review and discuss the written findings of fact, conclusions and recommended disposition at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting agenda. Any penalty for violation of the Code of Ethics must be approved by majority vote of the Council. If the Hearing Examiner determines that no violation of the Code of Ethics occurred, the determination is final and closed.

K. Neither the City nor any official may take or threaten to take, directly or indirectly, official or personal action, including but not limited to discharge, discipline, personal attack, harassment, intimidation, or change in job, salary, or responsibilities against any person because that person filed a complaint.

The purpose of this chapter is to set forth a process to address employment complaints against the City Manager by City employees. (Ord. 16-1029 § 1 (part))


2.95.020 Process. 

The following process is established to address employment complaints against the City Manager by City employees:

A. An employee may submit to the entire City Council or to their Department Director a written employment complaint against the City Manager. In addition, a copy of the written complaint shall be provided to the City Attorney and the Human Resources Manager. If a complaint is submitted to a Department Director, the Director shall forward the complaint to the City Council by the next business day after receipt.

B. Within two (2) business days of receipt of the complaint, or as soon as practicable, the Mayor (or Deputy Mayor in the case of absence or temporary disability of the Mayor) shall acknowledge receipt of the complaint in writing to the complainant, which shall include a nonretaliation affirmation on behalf of the City Council. The City Attorney and/or the Human Resources Manager shall make attempts to notify the Mayor of any received complaints so an acknowledgment can be processed.

C. The employment complaint shall be addressed by the Council in executive session at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting. However, a special meeting of the Council may be called by the Mayor to discuss the complaint in executive session. Alternatively, a majority of the City Council may call for a special meeting in accordance with RCW 42.30.080(1) and Section 4(D) of the City Council Administrative Procedures. 

D. The Mayor may, but is not required to, place the City Manager on paid administrative leave until the next business meeting of the City Council following receipt of the complaint by delivering written notice to the City Manager. Written notice may be delivered by someone other than the Mayor, either in person, by mailing to the City Manager’s home address that is on file with the City, or other reasonable means. Paid administrative leave is temporary leave, with pay and benefits, and with or without restrictions of duties. 

E. At the next business meeting of the City Council following receipt of the complaint, the City Council may, but is not required to, place the City Manager on paid administrative leave by taking formal Council action, which may be accomplished by motion or resolution. If the Mayor places the City Manager on paid administrative leave in accordance with subsection (D) of this section, the City Council must take formal Council action in order for such leave to continue.

F. The City Council will, as soon as practicable, determine whether the complaint should be investigated, and who should conduct the investigation. Investigations may be conducted by the City staff (such as the City’s Legal Department or Human Resources Department), or by someone not employed by the City. However, in no event shall a City Council member conduct an investigation.

G. After completion of the investigation, or within thirty (30) calendar days if no investigation has been undertaken, the City Council shall make a final decision through formal Council action, including what, if any, steps should be taken with regard to the resolution of the complaint. If the City Council determines that removal of the City Manager is appropriate, the procedures set forth in Chapter 35A.13 RCW must be followed.

H. Once a final decision has been made by the City Council, the Mayor shall communicate to the complainant the resolution of the complaint. (Ord. 16-1029 § 1 (part))


2.95.030 Advice and assistance to the City Council. 

The Mayor and the City Council are encouraged to seek the advice and assistance of the Legal Department and/or Human Resources with any part of the process outlined in SMC 2.95.020. (Ord. 16-1029 § 1 (part))


2.95.040 Other remedies available.

1. To provide a uniform system to obtain supplies, materials, equipment, and services in an efficient and timely manner;

2. To facilitate responsibility and accountability with the use of City resources;

E. All purchases shall comply with appropriate and relevant Federal, State, and City laws and policies. If the appropriate and relevant Federal or State laws, regulations, grants, or requirements are more restrictive than these guidelines, such laws, regulations, grants, or requirements should be followed. Furthermore, the City Attorney should be consulted when questions regarding potential conflicts arise. (Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))

3.31.040 Determining total purchase cost.

B. No “Bid Splitting.” Requirements shall not be divided in order to come up with a lower total cost that avoids contract approval levels or competition requirements. If one (1) item being purchased requires another item to “make a whole,” the total accumulated costs of the two (2) items should be considered together to determine which approval level and cost threshold apply.

C. Costs such as taxes, freight, and installation charges shall be included when determining which cost threshold applies. The value of a trade-in, when applicable, shall be considered to determine the lowest bid when competitive bidding is used.

D. Requirements for the total quantity of an item (when they can reasonably be projected) should be considered when determining which cost threshold and related purchasing requirements apply.

E. If a project is to be completed in phases, the total accumulated cost for all phases shall be used when determining which contract approval level applies. (Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))

B. The approval process for contract amendments, except contract amendments for public works, is set forth in this subsection.

1. The City Manager may execute an amendment without City Council approval; provided, that the amendment:

a. Extends the time of completion for a project. Such an extension can be for up to six (6) months; and/or

b. Provides for a cost increase that does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the original contract cost or fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), whichever is less, and such cost increase does not require additional budget appropriations; or

1. The City Manager or designee may execute an amendment to a public works contract, including change orders, without City Council approval; provided, that the amendment or change order does not increase the cost of the original contract amount beyond any contingency authorized by the City Council when the contract was awarded. (Ord. 12-1005 § 1: Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.060 Purchasing procedures for supplies, equipment, nonprofessional services, and information services.

A. This section applies to purchases of supplies, equipment, nonprofessional services and information services. This section does not apply to the purchase of supplies or services that are considered to constitute a public work (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.090), contracting for professional services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.070), or the contracting of architectural, engineering, or design services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.080).

B. Purchases that do not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) may be entered into through direct negotiation. Advertisement and competitive bidding is not required, although every effort shall be made to receive the best price possible.

C. For purchases exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), but less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), at least three (3) quotations shall be obtained. Quotations may be obtained by telephone or in writing (which includes electronic communications such as fax and email), and quotations shall be recorded and available for public inspection. Advertisement is not required. The purchase shall be made from the responsible vendor providing the lowest quotation. When three (3) quotations cannot be obtained, the City Manager shall be so notified at the time that the purchase is submitted for approval in accordance with SMC 3.31.050.

D. For purchases exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), but less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), formal competitive bids shall be obtained. Bids do not need to be sealed, but shall be in writing (which includes electronic communications such as fax and email). The competitive bidding procedures set forth in SMC 3.31.100 shall be followed.

E. For purchases exceeding three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), competitive sealed bids shall be obtained. The competitive bidding procedures set forth in SMC 3.31.100 shall be followed.

F. RCW 39.30.045 allows for the purchase of any supplies or equipment at auctions rather than through competitive bidding, if the items can be obtained at a competitive price. Purchases of supplies or equipment may be acquired at auction, subject to the provisions of RCW 39.30.045 so long as the City Council has authorized the expenditure of funds for the particular purchase as required in SMC 3.31.050.

G. RCW 39.33.010 allows for the purchase of surplus property from other governmental agencies. Surplus property may be acquired from other governmental agencies, subject to the provisions of RCW 39.33.010, so long as the City Council has authorized the expenditure of funds for the particular purchase as required in SMC 3.31.050.

H. RCW 39.04.080 authorizes one (1) public agency to contract with another public agency to perform any function which each agency is authorized by law to perform itself. Contracts with another public agency are authorized, subject to the provisions of RCW 39.04.080 so long as the City Council has authorized the expenditure of funds for said contract as required in SMC 3.31.050. (Ord. 12-1005 § 2: Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.070 Procedure for professional services contracts.

A. This section applies to contracts for professional services. This section does not apply to the purchase of supplies or services that are considered to constitute a public work (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.090), purchase of supplies, equipment, nonprofessional services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.060), or the contracting of architectural, engineering, or design services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.080).

B. A formal process is not required for the selection of vendors providing professional services. Furthermore, it is recognized that a formal professional services selection process may not be advantageous, based on the nature of the needed services, and the dollar value involved. Therefore, a process to select vendors for professional services contracts may be utilized that the City Manager deems appropriate, considering both the vendors’ qualifications and the cost of the services being provided. Such process may include procedures set forth for selecting vendors for architectural, engineering, and design services.

C. The City Manager must be able to identify what, if any, selection process and/or criteria was used in selection of a vendor. For contracts subject to City Council approval, the City Council reserves the right to require additional selection processes to be followed, in order to ensure that the most highly qualified vendor is chosen to contract with the City. (Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.080 Procedures for architectural, engineering, and design services.

A. This section applies to contracts for architectural, engineering, and design services. This section does not apply to the purchase of supplies or services that are considered to constitute a public work (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.090), purchase of supplies, equipment, nonprofessional services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.060), or the contracting for professional services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.070).

B. Chapter 39.80 RCW outlines the requirements for obtaining professional architectural or engineering services. The requirements outlined in Chapter 39.80 RCW as stated in this section, or as may be amended by the State Legislature, shall be followed.

C. Contracts for these services will be approved in accordance with the contract approval levels outlined in SMC 3.31.050. (Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.090 Procedures for public works.

A. This section applies to contracts for public works. This section does not apply to the contracting for architectural, engineering, and design services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.080), purchase of supplies, equipment, nonprofessional services and information services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.060), or the contracting for professional services (which is addressed in SMC 3.31.070). This section is not intended to conflict with State law.

B. As defined in RCW 39.04.010, public works include (but are not limited to) all work, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement (other than ordinary maintenance, engineering analysis, and design and other professional services) executed at the City’s cost, or which is by law a lien or charge on any property therein.

C. Pursuant to RCW 35.22.620, the cost of a public works project is the costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor on the construction of that project.

D. For public works projects, the Purchasing Agent may use the small works roster procedures when applicable, as established by Council resolution.

E. Public works projects shall be awarded by use of competitive sealed bidding as provided in SMC 3.31.100 if the small works roster procedures are not used.

F. The City is required by RCW 39.12.040 to require contractors to pay prevailing wages on all public works contracts. A “statement of intent to pay prevailing wages” must be received from a contractor prior to the start of any construction, and an “affidavit of wages paid” must be received following final acceptance of the work.

G. RCW 39.08.010 mandates that the City require a performance bond for every public works contract. The performance bond shall be received by the City within seven (7) calendar days of contract execution or prior to the start of any construction, whichever is earlier. The bond shall also be executed by a surety company authorized to do business in Washington State, in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the price specified in the contract.

1. For contracts of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) or less, the City may retain fifty percent (50%) of the contract for thirty (30) days after final acceptance, or until receipt of all necessary releases from the Department of Revenue and Department of Labor and Industries, and settlement of any liens filed under Chapter 60.28 RCW (whichever is later), in lieu of a performance bond. This requirement is at the option of the contractor.

2. For contracts being awarded under the limited small works roster process provided under RCW 39.04.155(3), the payment and performance bond requirements of Chapter 39.08 RCW may be waived.

H. In order for a bid to be considered responsive for public works contracts valued at over one million dollars ($1,000,000), every bidder must submit (either with their bid or within one (1) hour of the bid submittal time) the names of all subcontractors that will be used for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical work, pursuant to RCW 39.30.060. (Ord. 12-1005 § 3: Ord. 10-1007 § 1: Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.100 Competitive bidding procedures for public works projects.

A. Public Notice. While State law does not contain any detailed requirements for public notice, good business practice calls for using a notification process that will reach the most contractors and allow enough time for responsive bids to be prepared. At a minimum, notice shall be published in the City’s official newspaper at least twice, and each publication shall be a minimum of five (5) days apart. Furthermore, the first notice shall be published at least thirteen (13) days prior to the last date upon which bids will be received, and the second notice shall occur at least seven (7) days prior to the last date upon which bids will be received. In addition to publication in the City’s official newspaper, public works projects that exceed the maximum dollar amount for utilization of the small works roster must also be advertised in the Daily Journal of Commerce in the same manner as the City’s official newspaper.

B. Submittal of Bids. Bids will be submitted as specified in the invitation for bid by the appointed date and time listed in the invitation. All bids must be filled out in ink or be typewritten and must be properly signed by an authorized representative of the vendor. All changes and/or erasures shall be initialed in ink. Unsigned bids shall be rejected. Each bid will be date and time stamped as it is received, and late bids will not be accepted. If a bid is a sealed bid, all qualified bids will be opened and read aloud publicly at the appointed time.

C. Cancellation. An invitation for bids may be cancelled. 

D. Award. The contract will be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria included in the invitation for bids. 

E. No City representative shall inform a vendor of the terms or amount of any other vendor’s bid for the same project prior to the bid opening date and time. Once bids have been submitted (and opened, if the bids are sealed), the City may not negotiate with bidders. The contract must be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, or else the City Council may choose to reject all bids by Council action.

F. A written record shall be made of each bid on a project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bids shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone inquiry.

G. The original bid responses shall be filed with the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days of the date bids were due, and will be retained for review and audit as required.

H. Bid Security. In general, bid security is optional. However, bid security shall be required for all competitive bidding of public works projects valued in excess of the maximum dollar amount allowed for utilization of the small works roster. Security shall be in the form of a bond with a value of five percent (5%) of the amount of the bid, provided by a surety company that is authorized to do business in Washington State, or the equivalent in cash or certified check. When the invitation for bids requires submittal of bid security, noncompliance will result in rejection of the bid. If a bidder is permitted to withdraw a bid before award, its bid security shall be returned.

I. Noncollusion Affidavit. Each bidder may be required to warrant that their bid is genuine, and that they have not entered into collusion with other bidders, by submitting with their bid an executed and notarized affidavit. (Ord. 12-1005 § 4: Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.110 Emergency purchases.

In the event of an emergency when the public interest or property of the City would suffer material injury or damage by delay, the City Manager may waive the requirements set forth in this chapter. The City Manager shall report, in detail, such emergency expenditures to the City Council within twenty (20) days of purchases or contracts entered into pursuant to this section, or as soon as practicable. Written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular vendor or vendors shall be filed with the City Clerk within twenty (20) days of procurement. If an emergency is proclaimed pursuant to Chapter 2.75 SMC, the provisions of that chapter shall supersede in the event of any conflicts. (Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.120 Sole source and special market conditions.

A. The provisions of this section only apply to the purchase of supplies, equipment, and information services.

B. Sole source purchases are authorized when:

1. There is clearly and legitimately only one (1) source capable of supplying the good or service in a timely fashion; or

2. There are special circumstances or market conditions that result in only one (1) appropriate source. This includes parts and services for equipment and technical support for computer software or hardware that the City is already using.

C. Purchases may be made from a sole source vendor without soliciting other quotes or bids. However, written documentation demonstrating the appropriateness of a sole source purchase shall be submitted to the City Manager in advance of the purchase. The City Manager will evaluate whether a vendor can legitimately be defined as a sole source, pursuant to RCW 39.04.280. Any sole source purchases and contracts and the basis for the exception from competitive procurement shall be recorded and open to public inspection immediately after the purchase.

D. Any purchases or agreements entered into under authority of this section are subject to the contract approval limits set forth in SMC 3.31.050. (Ord. 09-1011 § 1 (part))


3.31.130 Electronic data processing and telecommunications systems.

A. Duration of Exemption. The value of improvements for property qualifying under this chapter is exempt from ad valorem property taxation as follows:

5.25.010 Findings.

The City Council finds that the development of cable television and communications systems has the potential of greatly benefiting and impacting the residents of the City. The Council further finds that because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable systems, the public’s convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing powers which should be vested in the City as provided in Federal and State law, or such persons as the City shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter to specify and provide the means to attain the public interest and purpose in these matters, to promote competition and minimize unnecessary regulation that would impose an undue economic burden on the system, and to assure the provision of the widest possible diversity of information over cable systems consistent with the public good. Any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include these findings as an integral part thereof. (Ord. 90-1028 § 1)

5.40.010 Purpose and intent.

It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually-oriented businesses and related activities to promote health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of SeaTac, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexually-oriented businesses within the City. It is not the intent of the City that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of the City that it should be the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually-oriented materials protected by the State or Federal Constitutions, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually-oriented material to their intended market. Neither is it the intent of the City that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. (Ord. 98-1012 § 1: Ord. 95-1018 § 1)


5.40.020 Findings.

Based upon a wide range of evidence presented to the SeaTac City Council and to other jurisdictions, including but not limited to the testimony of law enforcement officers and members of public, and on other evidence, information, publications, articles, studies, documents, case law and material submitted to and reviewed and considered by the City Council and staff, the councils of other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions, nonprofit organizations and other legislative bodies, the City Council makes the following findings:

A. Certain conduct occurring on premises offering sexually-oriented business creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and therefore such conduct must be regulated as provided herein.

B. Regulation of the sexually-oriented business industry through permitting and/or licensing is necessary because, in the absence of such regulation, significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred.

C. Proximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact, prostitution and related crimes. Concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the City which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.

D. It is necessary to license entertainers in the sexually-oriented industry to prevent the exploitation of minors, to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult, and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name, which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible.

E. The evidence supporting the need to protect minors and families from the criminal and other unlawful activities associated with the operation of sexually-oriented businesses is compelling. The provisions of this chapter are necessary to ensure that sexually-oriented uses in SeaTac are conducted a reasonable distance away from places where minors regularly gather, often in large numbers.

F. It is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexually-oriented businesses at such times as such establishments are offering sexually-oriented business so there will, at all necessary times, be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment, including the actions of patrons, entertainers and other employees.

G. The license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary cost recoupment measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the City in regulating the sexually-oriented businesses, and in increased police costs in enforcement.

H. Enterprises providing sexually-oriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution, disruptive conduct and other criminal activity. Such businesses are currently not subject to effective regulation and constitute an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety. The hours of operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of illegal drug transactions and other criminal activities.

I. Due to the information presented regarding the connection of prostitution with sexually-oriented businesses, there is concern over sexually-transmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the City and thus requires regulation of sexually-oriented businesses in order to protect the health, safety and well-being of the public.

J. Many cities, including Seattle and Tacoma, have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexually-oriented business land uses. The skid row effect is one of these secondary impacts and is evident in certain parts of Seattle. Such an effect would be significantly magnified in SeaTac due to the difference in size and characteristics of the City.

K. The City of SeaTac may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities, counties and organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexually-oriented business uses, operations and licensing.

L. The City takes notice of studies and experiences of other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexually-oriented businesses.

M. Regulation of sexually-oriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists, rather than in response to an existing problem.

N. Increased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of sexually-oriented businesses. Additionally, hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits, avoiding payment of taxes, and racketeering have historically occurred in sexually-oriented businesses, in the absence of regulations.

O. The City Council therefore finds that the protection and the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare requires establishment of this chapter.

P. There are sufficient important and substantial government interests to provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of time, place, and manner under which sexually-oriented businesses can operate.

Q. Since 1995, police officers have conducted numerous investigations at the City of SeaTac’s existing adult entertainment establishment. These investigations conducted by both uniformed officers and undercover officers have resulted in the issuance of over sixty (60) citations for criminal violations. A majority of the violations involved physical contact between an entertainer and a patron.

R. It is not the intent of this chapter to unconstitutionally suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution nor Article 1, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution, but to enact content-neutral ordinances which address the secondary effects of sexually-oriented businesses, as well as the health problems associated with such businesses.

S. In a family community, sexually-oriented businesses are not uniformly compatible with community standards, as defined during the numerous public hearings.

T. The law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by sexually-oriented businesses are limited and are best conserved by regulating and licensing sexually-oriented businesses and those associated with them.

U. In order to assure that all conditions, regulations, etc. are met, the City has established a reasonable time period for review of license applications. (Ord. 98-1012 § 1: Ord. 95-1018 § 1)

A. Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the City constitutes a nuisance.

B. Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, obtaining convictions for such acts is difficult because the offenses involving can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the acts are frequently nonexistent.

C. Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to the proper authorities, it is also important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the product of the illegal acts of those involved in application of graffiti is not visible and the property on which the graffiti is located and surrounding properties do not suffer diminution of value.

C. “Private contractor” means any person with whom the City shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti. (Ord. 92-1025 § 1) 


7.35.030 Graffiti prohibited.

It shall be unlawful for any person to write, paint or draw upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate or other structure, tree, or other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as “graffiti” within the City. (Ord. 92-1025 § 1) 


7.35.040 Graffiti – Notice of removal. 

A. Whenever the City Manager, or his/her designated representative, determines that graffiti exists on any public or private buildings, structures, and places which are visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right-of-way within the City, and when seasonal temperatures permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the Code Enforcement Officer or his/her designated representative shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the City.

B. The notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall cause a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owners’ name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of King County, Washington. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners:

1. By personal service on the owner, occupant or person in charge or control of the property;

2. By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address in unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address.

The notice shall be substantially in the following form: 

Notice of Intent to Remove Graffiti

Date:

To:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that you are required, by Ordinance of the City of SeaTac, at your own expense, to remove or paint over the graffiti located on the property commonly known as (address), SeaTac, Washington, which is visible to public view, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this notice; or, if you fail to do so, the City requires the nuisance to be abated by removal or painting over of the graffiti. The cost of the abatement by the City or private contractors employed by the City to abate the nuisance will be assessed upon your property and such costs will constitute a lien upon the land until paid.

All persons having any objection to, or interest in said matters, are hereby notified to submit any objections or comments to the Code Enforcement Officer of the City of SeaTac or his/her designated representative, within ten (10) days from the date of this notice. If no objections or comments to the notice are received by the City, the City will, at the conclusion of the fifteen (15) day period, proceed with abatement of the graffiti inscribed on you property at your expense without further notice.

(Ord. 95-1012 § 1: Ord. 92-1025 § 1) 


7.35.050 City costs enforceable – Debt – Lien.

Any and all costs incurred by the City in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this chapter shall constitute a debt owed to the City by the property owner or person in charge or control of the property, and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property upon which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. (Ord. 92-1025 § 1)

All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the City, and any paint used to obliterate or cover graffiti shall be as close as practicable to background color(s). If the Code Enforcement Officer provides for the removal of the graffiti, he/she shall not authorize nor undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located.

B. Property owners in the City of SeaTac may consent in advance to City entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes. (Ord. 95-1012 § 1: Ord. 92-1025 § 1)

When an issue arises as to the amount of accrued paid sick time and/or paid safe time available to a covered worker under this chapter, if the hospitality employers and transportation employers do not maintain or retain adequate records documenting hours worked by the covered worker and paid sick and safe time taken by the covered worker, it shall be presumed that the hospitality employers and transportation employers have violated this chapter.

7.50.010 Purpose.

People should be able to enjoy ownership, use and possession of property without negative interference from chronic nuisance properties. The intent of the City Council in enacting this chapter is to exercise specific powers granted by the State of Washington to declare what shall be a nuisance, abate the same, and to impose fines upon parties who create, continue, or suffer nuisances to exist. In addition, the City Council intends to exercise the specific power granted by the State of Washington to provide for the punishment of all practices dangerous to public health or safety, and to make all regulations necessary for the preservation of public morality, health, peace, and good order within its limits.

Chronic nuisance properties present significant health, safety and welfare concerns, where the persons responsible for such properties fail to take corrective action to abate the nuisance condition. Chronic nuisance properties can have a tremendous negative impact upon the quality of life, safety and health of the neighborhoods where they are located. Chronic nuisance properties can be a financial burden to the City due to repeated calls for service necessitated by nuisance activities that repeatedly occur or exist on such properties. This chapter is enacted to provide a remedy for nuisance activities that are particularly disruptive to quality of life and repeatedly occur or exist at properties and provide a practical process for abating such activities and for holding accountable the persons ultimately responsible for such properties. This remedy is not the exclusive remedy available under state or local laws and may be used in conjunction with such other laws. (Ord. 16-1017 § 1 (part))

Chapter 8.20 ALARM SYSTEMS

Sections:

8.20.010    Purpose.

8.20.020    Definitions.

8.20.030    Alarm system requirements.

8.20.040    Alarm user duties.

8.20.050    Alarm business duties.

8.20.060    Alarm system monitoring company duties.

8.20.090    No response to premises with excessive false alarms.

8.20.100    Administrative appeal hearing.

8.20.110    Severability.


8.20.010 Purpose.

A. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage alarm users, alarm businesses, and alarm monitoring companies to assume increased responsibility for the mechanical/electrical reliability and proper use of alarm systems and to prevent unnecessary police emergency response to false alarms, thereby to protect the emergency response capability of the City from misuse.

B. The obligation of complying with this chapter and liability for failing to do so is placed on the parties responsible for owning, operating, monitoring or maintaining alarm systems. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)


8.20.020 Definitions.

The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

A. “Alarm business” means the business by an individual, partnership, corporation or other entity of selling, leasing, maintaining, monitoring, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving or installing an alarm system or causing to be sold, leased, maintained, monitored, serviced, repaired, altered, replaced, moved or installed an alarm system in or on any building, structure or facility.

B. “Alarm dispatch request” means a notification to a law enforcement agency by an alarm business or another party that an alarm, either manual or automatic, has been activated at a particular alarm site.

C. “Alarm monitoring company” means an individual, partnership, corporation or other form of association that engages in the business of monitoring property, burglary, robbery or panic alarms and reporting activation of the alarm system to a law enforcement agency.

D. “Alarm site” means a single premises or location served by an alarm system or systems. Each tenancy, if served by a separate alarm system in a multi-tenant building or complex, is a separate alarm site.

E. “Alarm system” means any system, device or mechanism which, when activated, transmits a signal or message to a private alarm monitoring company or some other entity, or emits an audible or visible signal that can be heard or seen by persons outside the protected premises, or transmits a signal beyond the premises in some other fashion, to report a crime in progress or other crisis situation requiring a police response. “Alarm system” does not include a fire alarm system, medical alert system or an alarm installed on a motor vehicle.

F. “Alarm user” means any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind and which uses an alarm system at its alarm site.

G. “Department” means the City of SeaTac Police Department.

H. “Department’s communication center” means the Department’s dispatch center which receives requests for service for police and fire, including the communications center of the King County Sheriff’s Office.

I. “False alarm” means the activation of any combination of burglary, robbery, panic or yard alarm when no crime is being committed or attempted on the premises. An alarm is presumed false if the law enforcement officers responding to the alarm site do not locate any evidence of an intrusion or commission of an unlawful act or emergency on the premises which might have caused the alarm to sound. However, “false alarm” does not include an alarm caused by extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm business operator or alarm user. An alarm dispatch request that is canceled by the alarm system monitoring company or the alarm system user before arrival of law enforcement officers to the alarm site is not a false alarm for the purposes of fine assessment or no-response status designation.

J. “Monitoring” means the process by which an alarm business receives signals from the alarm system and relays an alarm dispatch request to the proper jurisdiction for the purpose of summoning police response to the alarm site.

K. “No response” means that law enforcement officers may not be dispatched to investigate a report of an alarm dispatch request.

8.20.030 Alarm system requirements.

A. An alarm system may not have an alarm signal audible on the exterior of an alarm site that sounds longer than ten (10) minutes after being activated. Nothing in this section shall limit the duration of a fire or other evacuation alarm during a bona fide emergency when the sound may assist in saving life or avoiding injury.

B. The installation or use of any electric, electronic or mechanical security device which gives automatic notice to the communications center of the Sheriff’s Office, the Department, or the Department’s Communication Center is prohibited, except by federal, state or local government agencies acting with the permission of the Police Chief.

8.20.050 Alarm business duties.

Every alarm business engaging in business activities in the City of SeaTac shall:

A. Submit standard user form instructions to the Police Chief, which provide information to enable the alarm user to operate the alarm system at any time. If the Police Chief finds the instructions are incomplete, unclear, or inadequate, the Police Chief will require the alarm business to revise the instructions. Copies of any revised instructions created under this subsection shall be furnished to the alarm user.

B. Provide the Police Chief information about the nature of its alarm systems, including property alarms, burglary alarms, robbery alarms, and panic alarms, its method of monitoring, its program for preventing false alarms, and its method of disconnecting audible alarms.

C. Furnish the alarm user with standard user form instructions, as submitted to the Police Chief pursuant to subsection A of this section. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)

5. An alternate system that the Police Chief determines has, or is likely to have, a high degree of reliability;

B. Coordinate with the Department’s communication center to develop a process to cancel an alarm dispatch that is consistent with the communication center’s standard operating procedures;

D. Request cancellation of an alarm dispatch request upon verifying no event has occurred that the alarm system was intended to report; and

E. Describe in plain language, other than a zone number, the specific location on the premises of the point of entry or unauthorized access. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)


8.20.070 False alarms.

A. It is unlawful for any alarm user, through error, omission or mechanical/electrical failure to cause a false alarm.

B. The Department shall notify the alarm user by first class mail of each false alarm, the fine, and the consequences of the failure to pay the fine. The Department shall also inform the alarm user of the right to appeal the validity of the false alarm determination, as provided in SMC 8.20.100.

The Department shall send the alarm user a notice of late fee by first class mail. If payment of the fine and late fee is not received within twenty (20) days of the date the notice of late fee was mailed, the Police Chief may initiate the no response process.

D. The Department shall issue notice of infraction to an alarm user following a violation of this section. The Department shall notify the SeaTac Department of Finance of the charges, fees and penalties that are to be collected.

8.20.080 Excessive false alarms – Penalties.

A. For a response to premises at which a false alarm has occurred, the person having or maintaining the alarm system shall within seven (7) days’ notice to do so make a written report to the Department on forms prescribed by the Department setting forth the cause of the false alarm, the corrective action taken and such other information as the Department may require to determine the cause of the false alarm and corrective action necessary.

B. Penalties will be assessed by the Department for excessive false alarms according to the following schedule:

1. One (1) or fewer false alarms in a consecutive six (6) month period – no charge.

2. Two (2) or more false alarms in a consecutive six (6) month period – one hundred dollar ($100.00) fine.

3. Late fee – twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fine. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)


8.20.090 No response to premises with excessive false alarms.

A. After the third false alarm in a six (6) month consecutive period, or the failure to pay any outstanding penalties imposed under this chapter, the Department shall send a notification to the alarm user and the alarm monitoring company, if known, by first class mail, that contains the following information:

1. That the third false alarm has occurred, or that there is an unpaid penalty imposed under this chapter; and

2. That if another false alarm occurs within the six (6) month period, or if the outstanding penalty remains unpaid for twenty (20) days from the date of notice, the Department will not respond to any subsequent alarm activations without the approval of the Police Chief, or a visual verification.

B. 1. After the fourth false alarm within a consecutive six (6) month period, and after notice was sent to the alarm user as prescribed by subsection A of this section, the Department may not respond to subsequent alarms without approval of the Police Chief. If police response is suspended, the Police Chief shall send a notification of no response status to:

a. The Department’s communication center;

b. The alarm user, by first class mail; and

c. The alarm user’s alarm monitoring company, if known, by first class mail.

2. The notice must include the following:

a. That the approval of the Police Chief for reinstatement may only be obtained by applying in writing for the reinstatement. The Police Chief may reinstate the alarm user upon a finding that reasonable effort has been made to correct the false alarms, which may include documentation from an alarm business, stating that the alarm system is operating properly and that the alarm user’s agents are properly trained in the alarm system’s operation, and full payment has been made for any outstanding penalties due to the City of SeaTac for false alarms. The City of SeaTac and the Department are not responsible for costs incurred by the alarm user to qualify for reinstatement;

b. That the reinstated alarm users will incur penalties for any false alarm responses after reinstatement;

c. That the alarm user has the right to contest the validity of a false alarm determination through an administrative appeal hearing as set forth in SMC 8.20.100;

d. In the event that the no response process has been initiated solely due to nonpayment of penalties the Police Chief will reinstate the alarm user upon finding that all outstanding penalties have been paid; and

e. Any application for reinstatement shall be done in writing, on forms prescribed by the Department.

C. The suspension of police response may begin no sooner than twenty (20) days after the notice of no response status was sent by first class mail to the alarm user unless a written request for an appeal hearing has been filed in the required time period under this chapter.

D. The suspension of response under this chapter shall apply only to burglary and property alarm systems and shall not apply to any robbery, panic, or duress alarms. However, all such alarms shall be construed in determining the total number of false alarms under this chapter. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)


8.20.100 Administrative appeal hearing.

A. An alarm user may appeal the validity of a false alarm determination to the Police Chief. The appeal shall be in writing and shall be requested within ten (10) days of the notice of violation received from the Department or Police Chief. Failure to contest the false alarm determination in the required time period results in a conclusive presumption for all purposes that the alarm was false.

B. If a hearing is requested, written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be served on the user by the Police Chief, by first class mail, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing, which shall not be more than thirty (30) nor less than ten (10) days after the filing of the request for hearing.

C. The hearing shall be before the Police Chief or his/her designee. The alarm user and a representative of the Police Department shall have the right to present written and oral evidence. If the Police Chief or his/her designee determines that the false alarms alleged occurred, he/she will issue written findings waiving, expunging or entering the false alarm designation on an alarm user’s record. If false alarm designations are entered on the alarm user’s record, the Department and/or the City of SeaTac shall pursue the collection of the penalties. If the civil penalty is not found to be proper, then the alarm user shall bear no costs.

D. If a hearing is canceled more than ten (10) days after its request, then a cancellation fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) must be paid in addition to the amount of any penalties imposed under this chapter.

E. The decision made by the Administrative Hearing Officer may be appealed to the King County District Court. The appeal must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the decision of the Police Chief. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)


8.20.110 Severability.

If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the chapter or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. (Ord. 03-1029 § 2)

The tow truck operator shall maintain a record evidenced by the redeeming person’s signature that the notification was provided. (Ord. 00-1008 § 1)


9.25.050 Redemption of impounded vehicles.

Vehicles impounded pursuant to this chapter shall be redeemed only under the following circumstances, and pursuant to agreement between the City and the King County Sheriff’s Office:

A. Only the registered owner, a person authorized by the registered owner, or one who has purchased the vehicle from the registered owner, who produces ownership or authorization and signs a receipt therefor, may redeem an impounded vehicle. A person redeeming a vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter must, prior to redemption, establish that he or she has a valid driver’s license and insurance.

B. Any person so redeeming a vehicle impounded under this chapter shall pay the tow truck operator for costs of impoundment (removal, towing, and storage) and the administrative fee prior to redeeming such vehicle. The tow truck operator shall accept payment as provided in RCW 46.55.120(1)(e), as now or hereafter amended. If the vehicle was impounded pursuant to this chapter and was being operated by the registered owner when it was impounded, it may not be released to any person until all penalties, fines, or forfeitures owed by the registered owner have been satisfied. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter can be released only pursuant to written order from the King County Sheriff’s Office or a court.

C. The King County Sheriff’s Office shall assign an administrative hearings officer(s) to conduct post-impoundment hearings pursuant to this chapter. Any person seeking to redeem a vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter has a right to a hearing before an administrative hearings officer to contest the validity of an impoundment or the amount of removal, towing and storage charges or administrative fee. Any request for a hearing shall be made in writing, on a form provided by the King County Sheriff’s Office and signed by such person, and received by the King County Sheriff’s Office within ten (10) days (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of the latter of the date the notice of right of redemption and opportunity for hearing was mailed to the person or the date the notice was given to the person by the tow truck operator. Such hearing shall be provided as follows:

1. If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under SMC 9.25.020 have been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall be released immediately and a hearing shall be held within ninety (90) days of the written request for hearing.

2. If all of the requirements to redeem the vehicle, including expiration of any period of impoundment under SMC 9.25.020, have not been satisfied, then the impounded vehicle shall not be released until after the hearing which shall be held within two (2) business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the written request for hearing.

3. Any person seeking a hearing who has failed to request such hearing within the time specified in this section may petition the King County Sheriff’s Office for an extension to file a request for hearing. Such extension shall only be granted upon the demonstration of good cause as to the reason(s) the request for hearing was not timely filed. For the purpose of this section, “good cause” shall be defined as circumstances beyond the control of the person seeking the hearing that prevented such person from filing a timely request for hearing. In the event such extension is granted, the person receiving such extension shall be granted a hearing in accordance with this chapter.

4. If a person fails to file a timely request for hearing and no extension to file such a request has been granted, the right to a hearing is waived, the impoundment and the associated costs of impoundment are deemed to be proper, and neither the City nor County shall be liable for removal, towing and storage charges arising from the impoundment.

D. The SeaTac Police Chief, or designee, is authorized to release a vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment upon petition of the spouse or domestic partner of the registered owner of the vehicle, based on economic or personal hardship to such spouse or domestic partner resulting from the unavailability of the vehicle and, after consideration of the threat to public safety that may result from the release of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, the driver’s criminal history, driving record, license status and access to the vehicle. If such release is authorized, the person redeeming the vehicle must satisfy the requirements of SMC 9.25.050(A) and (B), with the exception of payment of the penalties, fines, or forfeitures owed by the driver, and with the exception of the administrative fee.

E. The SeaTac Police Chief, or designee, is authorized to release a vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter prior to the expiration of any period of impoundment upon the petition of the registered owner of the vehicle based upon economic or personal hardship or equity, provided the registered owner was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the impound, the owner did not know that the operator’s driver’s license and/or driving privilege was suspended or revoked, and the owner has not received a prior release under this subsection. If such release is authorized, the registered owner must satisfy the requirements of SMC 9.25.050(A) and (B), with the exception of the administrative fee, in order to redeem the vehicle.

F. In order to avoid discriminatory application, the SeaTac Police Chief, or designee, shall deny release in all circumstances without discretion, except as set forth in subsections D and E of this section. (Ord. 03-1028 § 2: Ord. 00-1008 § 1)


9.25.060 Post-impoundment hearing procedure.

Hearings requested pursuant to SMC 9.25.050 shall be held by an administrative hearings officer who shall determine whether the impoundment was proper and whether the associated towing and storage and administrative fees charged were proper. 

A. At the hearing, the King County Sheriff’s Office may produce any relevant evidence to show that either the impound or fees, or both, were proper. An abstract of the driver’s driving record is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the status of the driver’s license, permit or privilege to drive and that the driver was convicted of each offense shown on the abstract. In addition, a certified vehicle registration of the impounded vehicle is admissible without further evidentiary foundation and is prima facie evidence of the identity of the registered owner of the vehicle.

B. At the hearing, the person who requested the hearing may produce any relevant evidence to show that either the impound or fees or both were not proper.

C. If the impoundment is found to be proper, the administrative hearings officer shall enter an order so stating. In the event that the costs of impoundment (removal, towing, storage, and administrative fees) have not been paid or any other applicable requirements of SMC 9.25.050(A) or (B) satisfied, or any period of impoundment has not expired, the administrative hearings officer’s order shall also provide that the impounded vehicle shall be released only after payment of any fines imposed on any underlying traffic violations.

D. If the impoundment is found to be improper, the administrative hearings officer shall enter an order so stating and order the immediate release of the vehicle. If the costs of impoundment have already been paid, the administrative hearings officer shall enter judgment against the County and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment in the amount of the costs of the impoundment, which are removal, towing, storage and administrative fees, plus interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year from the date that person paid the costs, and the County shall comply with the order. If the costs of impoundment, which are removal, towing and storage, have not been paid, the hearings officer shall enter an order directing the County to pay the costs to the tow truck operator, and the County shall comply with the order. The County and City are not liable for damages if the police officer who ordered the impound relied in good faith and without gross negligence, on the records of the Department of Licensing in ascertaining whether the operator of the vehicle had a suspended or revoked driver’s license.

E. In the event that the administrative hearings officer finds that the impound was proper, but that the removal, towing or storage fees charged for the impoundment were improper, the administrative hearings officer shall determine the correct fees to be charged. If the costs of impoundment have been paid, the administrative hearings officer shall enter a judgment against the County and in favor of the person who has paid the costs of impoundment for the amount of the overpayment plus interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year on the overpayment from the date that person paid the costs, and the County shall comply with the order. The tow truck operator is liable to the County for the amount of the overpayment and interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year. The tow truck operator shall make the payment to the County no later than sixty (60) days after the tow truck operator receives notice of the requirement to pay. The County may bring an action in the King County District Court against the tow truck operator to recover the overpayment plus interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per year.

F. No determination of facts made at a hearing under this section shall have any collateral estoppel effect on a subsequent criminal prosecution and shall not preclude litigation of those same facts in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

G. An appeal of the administrative hearings officer’s decision shall be conducted according to, and is subject to, the procedures of this section. In accordance with RCW 46.55.240(1)(d), a decision made by an administrative hearings officer may be appealed to the King County District Court for final judgment. The hearing on the appeal under this subsection shall be de novo. A person appealing such a decision must file a request for an appeal in district court within fifteen (15) days after the decision of the administrative hearings officer and must pay a filing fee in the same amount required for the filing of a suit in District Court. If a person fails to file a request for an appeal within the time specified by this section or does not pay the filing fee, the right to an appeal is waived and the administrative hearings officer’s decision is final. (Ord. 00-1008 § 1)


9.25.070 Contracts for towing and storage.

The King County Sheriff’s Office, and the City Manager and/or designees, are authorized and directed to enter into appropriate agreements and to promulgate rules and regulations to provide for the fair and efficient administration of any contract(s) awarded to registered tow truck operators pursuant to this chapter. Such contracts shall be at no cost to the County and the City and shall provide that the tow truck operator may recover the costs of towing and storage only from the person seeking to redeem the impounded vehicle, or from the proceeds of sale of an unclaimed vehicle pursuant to RCW 46.55.130, and that the County and City shall not be responsible for payment of such costs except upon order of the administrative hearing officer pursuant to SMC 9.25.060. (Ord. 00-1008 § 1)

B. The use of automated traffic safety cameras is subject to the following restrictions:

1. The use of automated traffic safety cameras is restricted to two (2) arterial intersections and school speed zones only.

2. Automated traffic safety cameras may only take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while a violation is occurring. The picture must not reveal the face of the driver or of the passengers in the vehicle.

3. The City shall clearly mark all locations where automated traffic safety cameras are in use by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver that he or she is entering a zone where traffic laws are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera. 

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images prepared under this chapter are for the exclusive use of law enforcement in the discharge of duties under this chapter and are not open to the public and may not be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation under this chapter. No photograph, microphotograph, or electronic image may be used for any purpose other than enforcement of violations under this chapter nor retained longer than necessary to enforce this chapter. 

5. For the purposes of this chapter, “automated traffic safety camera” means a device that uses a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with an intersection traffic control system, or a speed measuring device, and a camera synchronized to automatically record one (1) or more sequenced photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images of the rear of a motor vehicle at the time the vehicle fails to stop when facing a steady red traffic control signal, or exceeds a speed limit in a school speed zone as detected by a speed measuring device. (Ord. 06-1025 § 3)


9.35.020 Notice of infraction.

A. Whenever any vehicle is photographed by an automatic traffic safety camera, a notice of infraction shall be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within fourteen (14) days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within fourteen (14) days of establishing the renter’s name and address under this section. The law enforcement officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation under this chapter. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction.

B. The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for such an infraction unless the registered owner overcomes the presumption in this section. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under subsection E of this section is responsible for such an infraction. 

C. In a traffic infraction case involving an infraction detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera system, proof that the particular vehicle described in the notice of traffic infraction was in violation of this section, together with proof that the person named in the notice of traffic infraction was at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, constitutes in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person in control of the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred. 

D. This presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states, under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony before the court that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care, custody, or control of some person other than the registered owner.

E. If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the peace officer shall, before such a notice of infraction is issued, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within eighteen (18) days of receiving the written notice, provide to the peace officer by return mail:

1. A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or 

2. A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred; or

3. In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty.

Timely mailing of this statement to the peace officer relieves a rental car business of any liability under this chapter for the notice of infraction. (Ord. 06-1025 § 3)


9.35.030 Response to notice of infraction.

A person receiving a notice of infraction based on evidence detected by an automated traffic safety camera may respond to such notice by mail. Such person must still respond in accordance with State law, including but not limited to RCW 46.63.070. (Ord. 06-1025 § 3)


9.35.040 Infractions processed.

Infractions detected through the use of automated traffic safety cameras are not part of the registered owner’s driving record under RCW 46.52.101 and 46.52.120. Additionally, infractions generated by the use of automated traffic safety cameras under this chapter shall be processed in the same manner as parking infractions, including for the purposes of RCW 3.46.120, 3.50.100, 35.20.220, 46.16.216, and 46.20.270(3).

The fine for infractions committed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be a base monetary penalty of one hundred one dollars ($101.00). (Ord. 06-1025 § 3)


9.35.060 Nonexclusive enforcement.

Nothing in this chapter prohibits a law enforcement officer from issuing a notice of traffic infraction to a person in control of a vehicle at the time a violation occurs under RCW 46.63.030(1)(a), (b), or (c). (Ord. 06-1025 § 3)

11.10.090 Application and processing of permits.

A. To obtain a right-of-way use permit the applicant shall file an application with the Department.

B. Every application shall include the location of the proposed right-of-way use, a description of the use, the planned duration of the use, applicant contact information, and all other information which may be required as specified in the procedures adopted under this chapter, and shall be accompanied by payment of the required fees.

C. All Class E applications shall also include numbers and sizes of hauling trucks (single or double beds).

D. The Director or designee shall examine each application submitted for review and approval to determine if it complies with the applicable provisions of this chapter and procedures adopted under this chapter. Other departments that have authority over the proposed use or activity may be requested to review and approve or disapprove the application. The Director or designee may inspect the right-of-way proposed for use to determine any facts which may aid in determining whether a permit should be granted. If the Director or designee finds that the application conforms to the requirements of this chapter and procedures adopted under this chapter that the proposed use of such right-of-way will not unduly interfere with the rights and safety of the public, and if the application has not been disapproved by a department with authority, the Director or designee shall approve the permit, and may impose such conditions thereon as are reasonably necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and safety and to mitigate any impacts resulting from the use.

E. All applications for permits will be submitted at least fifteen (15) days before the planned need for the permit, or such greater period as may be reasonably required by the Director or designee. If unforeseen conditions require expedited processing the City will attempt to cooperate, but additional fees to cover additional costs to the City may be charged.

F. Notwithstanding subsection (E) of this section, an application for a permit to conduct an expressive activity shall be submitted at least seventy-two (72) business hours in advance of the proposed event, unless good cause exists for a shorter time period. Additionally, if a permit request is due to a spontaneous event occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge within forty-eight (48) hours, the applicant shall make application to the City at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, or as soon as practicable prior to such event.

G. Upon submittal of a completed application, the Department shall collect from the applicant an application fee as provided in SMC 11.10.100(A). (Ord. 20-1003 § 2: Ord. 15-1014 § 1 (part): Ord. 96-1022 § 3)


11.10.100 Permit fees and charges.

The fee for each permit shall be set forth in the City’s fee schedule.

A. Application Fee. A nonrefundable application fee shall be charged for each right-of-way use permit application that is accepted for processing, counter service, and recordkeeping.

B. Processing of Application Fee. A fee for the processing of applications may be charged. The amount of the fee shall be determined based upon the time and costs required to review, inspect, research, and coordinate the applicant’s data for each permit application. The processing fee may be different depending upon the class of right-of-way use permit involved. However, this fee shall not be charged for Class A or Class B permit applications for expressive activities.

C. Daily Use Fee. Permits may include a fee for each day (or part thereof) for use of the right-of-way. The fee will compensate the City for monitoring and inspecting the site or activity. The daily use fee may be different depending upon the class of right-of-way use permit involved. A minimum of one (1) daily use fee per day will be charged for all Class E permit applications. This fee is in addition to reimbursement of actual expenses (subsection (D) of this section) and/or repair and replacement charges (subsection (E) of this section). However, this fee shall not be charged for Class A or Class B permit applications for expressive activities.

D. Reimbursement of Actual Expenses. When a permit is issued, the City will impose a charge based on the actual cost to compensate for its time and expenses. These costs may include street crews, signal crews, and police, if required to assist in the activity. A refundable deposit or other security device may also be required. Costs of damage to City property, or expense of assistance by City employees, may be deducted from the deposit, charged against the security device, or billed to the permittee directly. However, cost recovery shall be subject to the limitations set forth in SMC 11.10.105(A)(3) with respect to Class A or Class B permits issued for expressive activities.

E. Repair and Replacement Charges. If the City should incur any costs in repairing or replacing any property as the result of the permittee’s actions, the costs of repair and replacement shall be charged to the permittee. These charges will be for the actual costs to the City. All hauls in excess of fifty thousand (50,000) CY or hauling for more than one hundred (100) working days will require a walk-through and inspection by Department staff of the haul route prior to approval and issuance of the permit. A final walk-through upon completion of the hauling operation is also required. A comparison of pre- and post-haul route conditions will be performed to determine the extent of damage to City streets and right-of-way. The permittee (contractor and/or the owner) will be responsible for all costs associated with clean up, repair and reconstruction to bring the City streets and right-of-way to the pre-haul conditions or better.

F. Utilities. Utilities shall be charged at an hourly rate for City inspections and other services pursuant to the adopted fee schedule.

G. Waiver of Fees. Franchised utilities which must apply for permits because of City-initiated construction projects may be granted a waiver by the Director of normal permit fees. This provision shall only apply to work that would not normally have been done by the utility. (Ord. 20-1003 § 3: Ord. 15-1014 § 1 (part): Ord. 96-1031 § 2: Ord. 96-1022 § 3)


11.10.105 Permits for expressive activities.

1. Where the expressive activity will not require street closures, cost recovery shall be limited solely to a nonrefundable application fee pursuant to SMC 11.10.100(A).

2. The deposit, security device, and insurance requirement of SMC 11.10.150 shall be waived, provided that the applicant has filed with the application a verified statement that he or she intends the purpose of the activity to be an expressive activity.

3. Where the expressive activity will require temporary street closures requiring the City to provide services in the interests of public health, safety, and welfare, the Director or designee may condition the issuance of the permit upon an agreement to pay actual direct costs incurred by the City to a maximum of five hundred dollars ($500.00), which will be waived if the applicant provides evidence of an inability to pay.

4. Where a permit is requested for an expressive activity, the permit shall presumptively issue except that the City may deny a Class A or Class B permit for an expressive activity if the Director or designee makes written findings explaining how any of the following conditions will exist and cannot be reasonably accommodated:

a. The expressive activity will substantially interrupt public transportation or other vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area of its route; or

b. The expressive activity will cause an irresolvable conflict with construction or development in the public right-of-way or at a public facility; or

c. The expressive activity will block traffic lanes or close streets during peak commute hours on weekdays between 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on streets classified as principal arterials or minor arterials by the City’s Public Works Department; or

d. The expressive activity will result in the concentration of persons, animals, or vehicles that will unduly interfere with the movement of police, fire, ambulance, and other emergency vehicles on the streets; or

e. The expressive activity will substantially interfere with another activity or event for which a permit has already been granted or with the provision of City services in support of other scheduled activities or events; or

f. The expressive activity will have significant safety impact upon residential or business access and traffic circulation.

5. With regard to the permitting of expressive activities where the provisions in this section conflict with the provisions in any other section of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall prevail. (Ord. 20-1003 § 4)

Nothing in this chapter shall relieve a responding utility or City contractor from the requirement to obtain a right-of-way use permit after beginning emergency work in the right-of-way.

B. Upon suspension or revocation of a permit, all use of the right-of-way shall cease, except as authorized by the Director or designee.

(Ord. 20-1003 § 5: Ord. 15-1014 § 1 (part): Ord. 96-1022 § 3)

The scope of the service area is hereby found to be reasonable and established on the basis of sound planning and engineering principles. (Ord. 94-1002 § 1)


11.15.040 Imposition of impact fee on development activity.

A. The City hereby authorizes the assessment and collection of impact fees on development activity within the City, at the rate of three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500) per peak p.m. trip, effective January 1, 2017, as computed in accordance with the most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, as applied to the City’s adopted Comprehensive Plan and the Transportation Management Plan. It is hereby declared that such impact fees shall:

1. Only be imposed for system improvements that are reasonably related to new development; and

2. Not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, reasonably related to new development; and

3. Be used for system improvements that will reasonably benefit new development; and

4. Not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in any previously constructed system improvements.

Such impact fee schedule is based upon the formula for calculating the proportionate share of the cost of the system improvements, including the costs of previously constructed system improvements, necessitated by new development to be borne by impact fees, which formulas are described in the interim transportation plan element of the City’s Comprehensive Plan and incorporated herein by this reference.

B. Impact fee rates shall be updated annually using the following procedures:

1. A three (3) year moving average of the Washington State Department of Transportation Construction Cost Index will be used to determine the increase in fees for each year to reflect increased project costs. 

2. The indexed impact fee rates shall be effective January 1st. A copy of the indexed impact fee rates shall be provided to the City Council but the indexed rates shall become effective without further Council review.

The transportation impact fee rates shall be reviewed bi-annually to determine when a new transportation impact fee rate study should be prepared and presented to Council.

C. Unless the use of an independent fee calculation has been approved, or unless a development agreement entered into pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170 provides otherwise, the impact fees shall be calculated and paid per the following:

1. For platted and unplatted single-family residential lots and commercial and multi-family developments, fees shall be calculated based on the impact fee schedule in effect at the time a completed building permit application is filed and paid prior to permit issuance. For a change in use for which no building permit is required, the fee shall be calculated and paid based on the impact fee schedule in effect on the date of an approved change of use.

2. For residential land divisions and unplatted single-family residential lots, the impact fees may be deferred, but shall be paid at the time of final inspection for each building permit. Covenants prepared by the City to enforce payment of the deferred fees shall be recorded at the applicant’s expense prior to building permit issuance for platted and unplatted single-family residential lots. The fee shall be calculated based on the impact fee schedule in effect on the date of payment of the impact fee.

3. The term of deferral is eighteen (18) months from issuance of the building permit.

D. Failure to pay the impact fees for a given development activity at the time of assessment shall result in denial of the building permit for which the owner has applied.

E. In computing the fee applicable to a given development activity, credit shall be given for the fair market value, measured at the time of dedication of land or upon completion of dedicated improvements or construction, of any dedicated land for, improvements to, or construction of, any system improvements in the same category of public facilities as that of the applicable fee provided by the owner and required by the City as a condition of approving the development activity over and above the minimum development standards set out in the City’s subdivision and street ordinances.

F. The City Manager or designee may adjust the amount of the impact fee otherwise imposed hereby with respect to specific projects requiring a building permit upon determining that:

1. Unusual circumstances require such adjustment to ensure that such impact fees are imposed fairly; and

2. Studies and data submitted by the owner regarding the impacts of such owner’s proposed development activity requires such adjustment to ensure that such impact fees are imposed fairly. Impact fees shall not be deemed unfair unless such unusual circumstances and studies and data support a finding that the impact fees otherwise imposed hereby allocate to the specific project in question a share of the cost of the systems improvements reasonably related to new development that is greater than or substantially less than such project’s allocable proportionate share of such costs.

2. All electric and communication service lines from the existing overhead facilities within the area to any building, residence or other structure must be disconnected and be removed, and underground facilities and service be established within ninety (90) days after the date of the mailing of the notice;

3. Should such owner fail to convert from overhead to underground within ninety (90) days after the date of the mailing of the notice, the City shall order the electric and communication utilities to disconnect and remove the overhead service facilities and lines;

4. Should the owner object to the disconnection and removal of the overhead facilities and service lines, the owner may file written objections thereto with the City Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of the mailing of the notice and failure to so object within such time will constitute a waiver of the owner’s right thereafter to object to such disconnection and removal.

J. Upon the timely filing by the owner of objections to the disconnection and removal of overhead facilities and service lines, the City Council shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the removal of all or any part of the overhead facilities and service lines is in the public benefit. The hearings shall be held at such time as the Council may establish and shall be held in accordance with the regularly established procedures set forth by the City Council administrative procedures. The determination reached by the City Council shall be final.

K. Unless otherwise provided by Chapter 35.96 RCW, all of the general provisions relating to local improvements of cities and towns shall likewise apply to local improvements for the conversion of overhead electric and communication facilities to underground facilities.

L. Where above ground pole line installations are permitted under the variance procedures set forth in SMC 11.20.060, conductors shall be placed in vertical alignment or other approved alignment as authorized by the City’s Public Works Department.

M. Plans for all aboveground installations, including those excepted under SMC 11.20.010(D), shall be submitted to the City for approval of screening and setback requirements prior to the issuance of any permits in connection with such above ground installations in the public rights-of-way or in public utility easements.

N. Project “as-built” drawings, in a form and scale conforming to generally accepted engineering practices, shall be submitted in duplicate to the City’s Public Works Department within thirty (30) days of the completion of any underground project within the City. In addition, each utility shall submit in duplicate “as-built” drawings of all of its underground facilities within the City on an annual basis, commencing on January 1st following the effective date hereof; provided, that if said drawings are not available at that time, the utility shall be given a reasonable time to prepare and submit such drawings. The requirement to provide the drawings as specified in this subsection shall not relieve the applicant for a permit from providing preliminary plans in connection with the application for a permit for work in the public right-of-way or otherwise. (Ord. 97-1002 § 1)


11.20.040 Permits and fees.

A. A permit for work in the public right-of-way for undergrounding work shall be acquired by the utility from the Public Works Department prior to proceeding with construction of facilities in the public right-of-way, or within easements for public facilities, or public property. The fee for and terms for such permit for any undergrounding shall be pursuant to Chapter 11.10 of this title and the City’s approved fee schedule.

B. Where above grade pole line installations are permitted under the variance procedures of Section 11.20.060 of this chapter, a permit shall be acquired by the utility from the City’s Public Works Department prior to proceeding with construction of such facilities in the public right-of-way, or within easements for public facilities, or public property. The fee for and terms of such permit shall be pursuant to Chapter 11.10 of this title and the City’s approved fee schedule. (Ord. 97-1002 § 1)


11.20.050 Design standards.

A. All conductors, switches, transformers, and regulating devices shall be installed in accordance with applicable national, State and local safety standards. All structural devices shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of, and additions to, the Uniform Building Code adopted by the City, and all other applicable ordinances and regulations of the City as its building code.

B. All underground facilities provided for herein shall be installed in such manner as to be coordinated with underground water, sewer, and gas pipelines, and with traffic control and other signal systems. Whenever such coordination requires installation practices more restrictive or demanding than the minimum standards required by applicable national, State and local codes and safety standards, the requirements of such coordination shall govern and be controlling.

C. All vaults, manholes, ventilation gratings, and access covers and conduits in public rights-of-way shall be strong enough to withstand ten thousand (10,000) pounds wheel load. The utility may, at its option, elect not to comply with the said wheel load requirement as to such facilities not on the traveled portion of the street providing, however, that the utility shall be responsible for upgrading of the said facilities in event of widening of the traveled portion of the street.

D. Any equipment and facilities excepted from underground requirements or otherwise permitted to be installed aboveground except for poles, pole-mounted equipment, and aerial lines shall be:

1.  Placed within an enclosure or within the building or structure being served, or be suitably screened in accordance with the landscape requirements of Chapter 15.14 of this code.

2. The utility shall be responsible for the installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the sight screening materials and barrier when the real property on which the aboveground facility is located is owned by the utility.

3. When the aboveground facility is located on real property not owned by the utility, the owner of such real property shall be responsible for the installation, maintenance, repair, and replacement of the aforementioned screening materials and sight barrier.

E. Space frames and structural arrangements for holding equipment or facilities shall be designed to have an uncluttered and neat appearance.

F. Streets shall be excavated to subgrade prior to the installation of underground facilities as determined by the City’s Public Works Department. (Ord. 97-1002 § 1)


11.20.060 Variance procedures.

All applications for variance from the foregoing underground requirements shall first be filed with the City Clerk. Underground requirements shall be waived by a variance only if the utility, user, or other affected party can demonstrate that such requirements would cause an undue hardship and that the variance would not cause substantial adverse impact to other persons or entities in the immediate surrounding area. The term “undue hardship” is hereby defined as a technological difficulty associated with the particular facility, or with the particular real property involved, or the cost of undergrounding such facility which exceeds usual costs or is found to outweigh the general welfare considerations implicit in underground installation or that the particular real property is in an area where the pattern of growth and development has not yet been sufficiently established to permit the determination of ultimate service requirements or major service routes. (Ord. 97-1002 § 1)


11.20.070 Joint trenches.

In requiring undergrounding of electric and communications facilities, it is the City’s intent to authorize and encourage establishment of joint or common trenches, as follows:

A. Utilization of a single trench where feasible by all utilities and rights-of-way franchise holders is hereby encouraged and shall be required where ever feasible. Upon application for an underground right-of-way use permit, the City’s Public Works Department shall determine whether other utilities and franchise holders have applied, or may be likely to apply on a timely basis, for undergrounding along the same right-of-way and whether the permit, if issued, should require joint use of a common trench. If at the time of application for an underground permit it does not appear that all utilities involved in the undergrounding project have made appropriate arrangements for the use of the common trenches, the Public Works Department may delay the issuance of such permit until all utilities involved in such relocation shall have been given the opportunity to be heard upon two (2) weeks’ notice.

B. Where new structures require underground services extending into or across the public right-of-way to existing overhead distribution systems for connection, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner, owner’s agent or other persons applying for such underground service from an electrical or communications utility to provide adequate provisions and capacity for joint usage in a trench with conduit or other required facilities for present and future service extensions to the structure. The utility, property owner, owner’s, agent, or other person, applying for the permit shall notify all other electrical and communications utilities as to the availability of a common trench. The issuance of a permit may be delayed until all utilities involved in a street crossing for underground service connection to a structure have been given the opportunity to be heard upon two (2) weeks’ notice.

C. Whenever an electrical or communications facility, including but not limited to electrical power, telephone, telegraph, cable television, and fiber optics is required to be placed underground in a joint trench, then the costs of excavation and fill and also the costs of conduit, cable, vaults, and other appurtenant facilities shall be borne on an equal basis, or as agreed, by the utilities, franchise holders, or others participating in the undergrounding project. (Ord. 97-1002 § 1)


11.20.080 Enforcement.

Any violation of the provisions of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, by any individual or entity shall constitute a civil infraction and any individual or entity committing such infraction shall be subject to a civil penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation and for each day upon which any such violation shall continue. The City Manager, or designee, shall be responsible for investigation of violations and for enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 97-1002 § 1)

Affected employers located in the City of SeaTac are to receive written notification that they are subject to this chapter. Such notice shall be addressed to the company’s chief executive officer, senior official, CTR program manager, or employee transportation coordinator at the work site. Such notification shall provide ninety (90) days for the affected employer to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the City of SeaTac.

Affected employers that, for whatever reason, do not receive notice within thirty (30) days of adoption of this chapter and are either notified or identify themselves to the City of SeaTac within ninety (90) days of the adoption of this chapter will be granted an extension to assure up to ninety (90) days within which to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the City of SeaTac.

Affected employers that have not been identified or do not identify themselves within ninety (90) days of the adoption of this chapter and do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the City of SeaTac within ninety (90) days from the passage of this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

If an affected employer has already performed a baseline measurement, or an alternative acceptable to the City of SeaTac, under previous iterations of this chapter, the employer is not required to perform another baseline measurement.

C. Newly Affected Employers. Employers meeting the definition of “affected employer” in this chapter must identify themselves to the City of SeaTac within ninety (90) days of either moving into the boundaries of the City of SeaTac or increasing in employees at a work site. Employers who do not identify themselves within ninety (90) days are in violation of this chapter.

Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given ninety (90) days to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the City of SeaTac. Employers who do not perform a baseline measurement within ninety (90) days of receiving written notification that they are subject to this chapter are in violation of this chapter.

Not more than ninety (90) days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to the City of SeaTac. The program will be developed in consultation with City of SeaTac staff to be consistent with the goals of the CTR plan update adopted. The program shall be implemented not more than ninety (90) days after approval by the City of SeaTac. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter.

Newly affected employers will be given ninety (90) days to designate an employee transportation coordinator (ETC) to work closely with City of SeaTac staff to develop, implement, and monitor strategies and processes to meet defined CTR goals for their job site. If for any reason the ETC is displaced from their position, a new ETC must be designated by the employer within ninety (90) days. Employers who fail to designate an ETC within ninety (90) days of being identified as an affected employer are in violation of this chapter.

D. Change in Status as an Affected Employer. Any of the following changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements:

1. If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs one hundred (100) or more affected employees and expects not to employ one hundred (100) or more affected employees for the next twelve (12) months, that employer is no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the City of SeaTac that it is no longer an affected employer. The burden of proof lies with the employer.

2. If the same employer returns to the level of one hundred (100) or more affected employees within the same twelve (12) months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire twelve (12) months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.

3. If the same employer returns to the level of one hundred (100) or more affected employees twelve (12) or more months after its change in status to an “unaffected” employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers.

E. Requirements for Employers – RCW 70.94.531. An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and increase non-drive-alone commute trips.

11.30.070 Schedule and process for CTR program description and report.

A. Document Review. The City of SeaTac shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or annual report within ninety (90) days of submission, the employer’s program or annual report is deemed accepted. The City of SeaTac may extend the review period up to ninety (90) days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.

B. Schedule. Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, the City of SeaTac shall establish the employer’s regular reporting date.

C. Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the City of SeaTac for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if one (1) of the following conditions exists:

1. The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or

2. The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.

The City of SeaTac may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request.

D. Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description and report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least thirty (30) days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed ninety (90) days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The City of SeaTac shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within ten (10) working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for thirty (30) days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s annual reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the City of SeaTac.

E. Implementation of Employer’s CTR Program. Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than ninety (90) days after receiving written notice from the City of SeaTac that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from the City. (Ord. 15-1003 § 2 (part): Ord. 08-1021 § 2 (part): Ord. 98-1007 § 2; Ord. 93-1002 § 1. Formerly 11.30.090)


11.30.080 Enforcement.

A. Compliance. For purposes of this section, “compliance” shall mean:

1. Fully implementing in good faith all mandatory program elements as well as provisions in the approved CTR program description and report;

2. Providing a complete CTR program description and report on the regular reporting date; and

3. Distributing and collecting the CTR program employee questionnaire during the scheduled survey period, and achieving at least a fifty percent (50%) response rate.

B. Program Modification Criteria. The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:

1. If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program;

2. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required;

3. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable NDAT or VMT goals, the City of SeaTac shall direct the employer to revise its program within thirty (30) days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description and report, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The City of SeaTac shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the City of SeaTac will send written notice to that effect to the employer within thirty (30) days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the City of SeaTac within ten (10) working days of the conference.

C. Violations. The following constitute violations if the deadlines established in this chapter are not met:

1. Failure to self-identify as an affected employer;

2. Failure to perform a baseline measurement, including:

a. Employers notified or that have identified themselves to the City of SeaTac within ninety (90) days of the adoption of this chapter and that do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the requirements specified by the City of SeaTac within ninety (90) days from the notification or self-identification;

b. Employers not identified or self-identified within ninety (90) days of the adoption of this chapter and that do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the requirements specified by the City of SeaTac within ninety (90) days from the adoption of this chapter;

3. Failure to develop and/or submit on time a complete CTR program;

4. Failure to designate an ETC within ninety (90) days from notification or self-identification; in addition, failure to send ETC to ETC training within six (6) months of hire or designation as an ETC;

5. Failure to implement an approved CTR program, unless the program elements that are carried out can be shown through quantifiable evidence to meet or exceed VMT and non-drive-alone goals as specified in this chapter;

6. Submission of false or fraudulent data in response to survey requirements;

7. Failure to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534 and this chapter;

8. Failure to achieve at least a fifty percent (50%) CTR survey response rate during two (2) year survey cycle period; or

9. Failure to revise a CTR program as defined in RCW 70.94.534(4) and this chapter.

D. Penalties.

1. Violation of this chapter shall constitute a civil infraction subject to a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).

2. No affected employer with an approved CTR program which has made a good faith effort may be held liable for failure to reach the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal.

3. Each day of failure to implement the program is a continuing offense and shall constitute a separate violation.

4. An affected employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they:

a. Propose to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and

b. Advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the City of SeaTac and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with State law (RCW 70.94.531). (Ord. 15-1003 § 2 (part): Ord. 08-1021 § 2 (part): Ord. 98-1007 § 2; Ord. 93-1002 § 1. Formerly 11.30.140)


11.30.090 Exemptions and goal modifications.

A. Work Site Exemptions. An affected employer may request the City of SeaTac to grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular work site. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could increase the proportion of non-drive-alone trips and reduce VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by the City of SeaTac at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. The City of SeaTac shall grant or deny the request within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request. The City of SeaTac shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

B. Employee Exemptions. Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a work site’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. The City of SeaTac will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. The City of SeaTac shall grant or deny the request within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request. The City of SeaTac shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.

C. Modification of CTR Program Goals.

1. An affected employer may request that the City of SeaTac modify its CTR program goals. Such requests shall be filed in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the date the work site is required to submit its program description or annual report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the work site is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The work site must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program.

2. The City of SeaTac will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines.

3. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one (1) year after the City of SeaTac’s approval of its initial program description or annual report. (Ord. 15-1003 § 2 (part): Ord. 08-1021 § 2 (part): Ord. 98-1007 § 2; Ord. 93-1002 § 1. Formerly 11.30.100)

A. Employers may file a written appeal of the City’s final decisions regarding the following actions:

1. Rejection of an employer’s proposed program.

2. Denial of an employer’s request for a waiver or modification of any of the requirements under this chapter or a modification of the employer’s program.

B. Such appeals must be filed with the City within fifteen (15) days after the City sends a notice of final decision to the employer.

C. Timely appeals shall be heard by the City’s Hearing Examiner. Determinations on appeals shall be based on whether the decision being appealed was consistent with the State law. (Ord. 15-1003 § 2 (part): Ord. 08-1021 § 2 (part): Ord. 98-1007 § 2; Ord. 93-1002 § 1. Formerly 11.30.130)

(Ord. 02-1035 § 1)


11.40.020 Street designations.

A. The Director shall designate the name and/or number of private and public streets within the guidelines of the King County grid system. Streets shall be assigned a name only when the numbering grid is determined infeasible by the Director or when the City Council acts pursuant to SMC 11.40.070.

B. Consistent with the grid system, all streets within the City, except International Boulevard, shall be assigned the prefix or suffix “South.”

C. All streets extending in a northerly or southerly direction, except International Boulevard, Des Moines Memorial Drive South, and Military Road South, shall be designated by numbers and as “avenues” with the suffix “South.” The numeric designations shall commence with 6th Avenue South near the westernmost boundary of the City and shall continue consecutively to the easternmost boundary of the city.

D. All streets extending in a westerly and easterly direction, except Orillia Road South, shall be designated by numbers and as “streets” with the prefix “South.” The numeric designations shall commence with South 128th Street at the northernmost boundary of the city and shall continue consecutively to approximately South 230th Street at the southernmost boundary of the city.

E. Diagonal streets shall be treated as extending in either a north to south direction or a west to east direction depending upon the azimuth from magnetic north of the general direction of such streets.

F. Short, interrupted, closed-end, or cul-de-sac streets, generally less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length, irrespective of direction, shall be designated by numbers consistent with the numbering of nearby avenues or streets, and may be designated as “place” or “court” at the discretion of the Director.

G. Designation of any street as a “lane,” “circle,” “loop,” “crescent,” “way,” “drive,” “road,” or “boulevard” shall only be approved by the Director for good cause.

H. A continuous street, or one proposed to be continued, shall bear the same designation throughout its entire length. Exceptions may be allowed if a street changes direction sharply for a substantial distance. In such cases, the portion of the street running in a different direction may be given a separate designation. (Ord. 02-1035 § 1)

11.40.060 Street redesignations.

If the Director deems an existing private or public street to be inconsistent with the surrounding designation system or to be confusing or difficult to locate, then the Director may redesignate the street based upon considerations of consistency with the King County grid system, the impact on existing businesses and residences, and the impact upon responsiveness of emergency services. Notice of any intent to effect a redesignation shall be mailed by the Director to all property owners abutting on the affected street at least sixty (60) days prior to the intended effective date of the redesignation, and a notice shall similarly be published in the official newspaper. (Ord. 02-1035 § 1)


11.40.070 Council designation or redesignation of streets.

Notwithstanding the provisions of SMC 11.40.010 and 11.40.020, the City Council may designate new streets by name and may redesignate numeric streets to named streets by Council initiation or upon petition.

A. Petitions to the Council requesting that a street be named shall contain the signatures of a majority of persons owning properties abutting the street to be named or renamed.

B. Notice of a proposed street name street shall be mailed by the Director to all said abutting property owners at least sixty (60) days prior to the intended final action by the Council and a notice shall similarly be published in the official newspaper.

C. The Council shall consider technical input from the Director, locational and development characteristics relative to the street, and the impact of the change on existing businesses and residences, as well as on emergency vehicle responsiveness. The Council shall also consider the factors set forth in SMC 11.40.020(B) through (H) and the following criteria (from Resolution No. 94-017):

1. Neighborhood or geographical identification;

2. Natural or geological features;

3. Historical or cultural significance;

4. Whether the name identifies an individual or entity who has donated substantial monies or land or has been otherwise instrumental in City or community affairs, providing that the name of a living person shall not normally be used, although exceptions may be considered when significant contributions or unusually outstanding public service would so justify;

5. The articulated preference of residents of the neighborhood surrounding the street.

D. Designation or redesignation of a street name by the Council shall be effected by adoption of an ordinance directing the designation or redesignation. (Ord. 02-1035 § 1)


11.40.080 Notification.

The Director shall cause notice of all street designations and redesignations to be provided to the City Fire Department, Police Department, GIS, and other affected departments, together with notice to appropriate King County agencies, specifically including the E-911 administrator. (Ord. 02-1035 § 1)


11.40.090 Appeals.

Any party aggrieved by the designation or redesignation of a street may appeal such final action as an appeal from an administrative decision pursuant to SMC 1.20.110. (Ord. 02-1035 § 1)

11.50.040 Applicability.

A. All construction or change in use initiated pursuant to a development permit for which a development permit, concurrency approval, or a certificate of concurrency was issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be continued. However, if the City determines that a previously issued development permit for which the concurrency approval was granted has lapsed or expired, pursuant to the applicable development regulations, then no subsequent development permit shall be issued except in accordance with this chapter.

B. All development activities that generate an increase in PM peak hour trips are required to apply for concurrency review as part of applying for the associated land use permit. Upon approval of the land use permit, the City will issue a temporary certificate of concurrency that is valid as long as the land use permit is valid as provided in this chapter.

C. No concurrency evaluation shall be required if the Director determines that a change of use does not generate an increase of PM peak hour trips compared to the previous use. For the purpose of this subsection, “previous use” shall mean:

1. The use existing on the site when a concurrency evaluation is applied for; or

2. The most recent use on the site, within the one (1) year period prior to the date of application for development activity that had previously been approved for concurrency.

D. For the purposes of this chapter, application for a development permit shall include consideration of the cumulative impacts of all development permit applications for contiguous properties that are owned or under the control of the same person, firm or corporation, when one (1) or more development permits would be issued, or in the judgment of the Director may be issued, within two (2) years of the date of issuance of a development permit for such contiguous property.

E. The Director shall have sole authority to define development permits and activities that are exempt from concurrency management review on a case-by-case basis. The following types of development permits are typically exempt from the concurrency management ordinance and the requirements of this chapter because they do not generate additional PM peak hour trips. This type of development includes, but is not limited to, the following:

1. Access permit;

2. Demolition permit;

3. Right-of-way permit;

4. Clearing and grading (STE) permit;

5. Fire permit;

6. Interior alterations with no change of use;

7. Mechanical permit;

8. Plumbing permit;

9. Sign permit;

10. Single-family remodeling with no change of use;

11. Building permit for fences or retaining walls;

12. Single-family homes built on lots created by a final plat or final short plan that received a final certificate of concurrency within the last five (5) years. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.050 Level of service standards.

The Director shall use the level of service standards set forth in the transportation element of the City’s comprehensive plan to make concurrency evaluations as part of the review of any application for a concurrency certificate issued pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.060 Application for concurrency review.

A. An applicant shall submit a completed application for concurrency review when submitting an application for any land use permit. A temporary certificate of concurrency is issued after (1) a complete application for a land use permit, and (2) necessary concurrency review by the City. If no land use permit is required for the development activity, an application for concurrency review shall be submitted in conjunction with a construction permit.

B. All developments not exempt per SMC 11.50.040 shall submit a complete application for concurrency review to the City.

C. The application will include, as a minimum, the project name, address, type and size of the proposed development activity, and type of land use permit that will be sought upon approval of concurrency.

D. The Director may require the application to include an analysis of development activity trip generation and distribution for review and approval by the Director prior to conducting the concurrency evaluation.

E. If a change of use shall result in an increase in PM peak hour traffic generation over the previous use, then the application for concurrency review shall be required for the net increase only; provided, that the applicant provides reasonably sufficient evidence, to the satisfaction of the Director, that the previous use has been continuously maintained on the site during the five (5) year period prior to the date of application, or since the previous use was permitted, if that period is five (5) years or less, for the concurrency evaluation. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.070 Concurrency evaluation and determination.

A. To the greatest extent possible, the City will seek to identify concurrency-related issues as part of the preliminary application meeting.

B. Concurrency evaluations shall generally be processed in the order in which the applications for concurrency review are received. The concurrency evaluation shall result in issuance of a temporary certificate of concurrency or issuance of a concurrency denial letter.

C. Issuance of a temporary certificate of concurrency reserves concurrency for the development activity as long as the land use application remains valid, or for one (1) year, whichever is greater.

D. For a development activity that will generate less than fifteen (15) net new PM peak hour trips, concurrency is approved automatically. The development activity will be issued a temporary certificate of concurrency and the traffic from the development will be accounted for in subsequent concurrency studies or project-specific concurrency evaluations, unless the development is abandoned or expires prior to completion.

E. For development activities that are estimated to generate between fifteen (15) and three hundred (300) net new PM peak hour trips, a concurrency evaluation will be required.

1. If there are vehicle trips remaining on all concurrency corridors within the concurrency district where the development is occurring, then a temporary certificate of concurrency will be issued per SMC 11.50.060 and the development will be included in future concurrency studies or project-specific concurrency evaluations.

2. The Director may, at his/her discretion, require a project-specific concurrency evaluation be conducted based on the number and size of development projects that have been approved for concurrency that could impact travel speeds in a concurrency corridor, changes in financial commitments for transportation improvements that were assumed in the concurrency study, or other factors. The Director will document in writing the reasons for requiring a project-specific concurrency evaluation.

3. If a concurrency corridor within the concurrency district where the development is occurring is below the adopted LOS standard, then concurrency will be denied and a temporary certificate of concurrency will not be issued. Upon determination by the Director that adequate transportation facilities are not available to serve the proposed development, then the applicant can pursue options, including mitigation, per SMC 11.50.100.

F. For development activities that are estimated to generate more than three hundred (300) net new PM peak hour trips, a project-specific concurrency evaluation shall be required.

G. When a project-specific concurrency evaluation is needed, the City shall prepare an analysis consistent with the procedures used in the concurrency study, to assess the potential impacts of the development on travel speeds and levels of service of the designated concurrency corridors within the development’s concurrency district.

1. If the project-specific concurrency evaluation results in the City’s level of service standards being met, then a temporary certificate of concurrency will be issued per SMC 11.50.060 and the development will be included in future concurrency evaluations and annual concurrency studies.

2. The results of the project-specific concurrency evaluation will supersede the latest concurrency study and shall be the basis for subsequent concurrency evaluations.

3. If the project-specific concurrency evaluation results in one (1) or more concurrency corridors falling below the adopted level of service standards, then concurrency will be denied for the development and a temporary certificate of concurrency will not be issued. Upon determination by the Director that adequate transportation facilities are not available to serve the proposed development, then the procedures of SMC 11.50.100 shall be followed. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.080 Concurrency approval and temporary certificates of concurrency.

A. If the concurrency evaluation shows that adequate transportation facilities exist to serve the new development, then the concurrency application shall be approved. The Director shall issue a finding of concurrency approval and issue a temporary certificate of concurrency.

1. The temporary certificate of concurrency is put into effect at the point that the land use application is approved.

2. A temporary certificate of concurrency shall expire at the time the associated land use decision expires, or exactly one (1) year after the date of issue by the Director, whichever is greater.

3. For a land use permit, a temporary certificate of concurrency must be issued prior to determination of complete application for a construction permit.

B. A temporary certificate of concurrency shall apply only to the specific land uses, densities, intensities and development projects described in the approved concurrency application. In no event shall the Director determine concurrency for a greater number of PM peak hour trip generation than is needed for the development proposed in the underlying land use permit application.

C. A temporary certificate of concurrency shall be issued for all phases of a development permit, unless a project phasing plan is approved by the Director. When a phasing plan is approved by the Director, the temporary certificate of concurrency shall be conditioned to note that additional concurrency applications, evaluations, and certificates shall be required for future phases. The certificate shall specifically identify the amount, extent and timing of any required concurrency mitigation.

D. A temporary certificate of concurrency is not transferable to other real property. The temporary certificate of concurrency, once issued, shall become part of the land use permit or application and shall be transferred to new owners of the original land, if and only if the land use permit or application is so transferred to the new owners.

E. The applicant may, as part of a land use permit application, designate in writing the amount of trips approved within the temporary certificate of concurrency that are allocated to portions of the property, such as lots, blocks, parcels, or tracts included in the application. Any such allocation shall be reflected in the temporary certificate of concurrency. Trips may be reassigned or allocated within the boundaries of the original property only by application to and approval from the Director. If approval is granted, the Director shall amend the temporary certificate of concurrency accordingly.

F. A temporary certificate of concurrency will be issued prior to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) threshold determination process, if applicable. The temporary certificate of concurrency may be used to inform a SEPA threshold determination.

G. If a temporary certificate of concurrency is issued for a proposed development activity, but the associated land use permit is denied, expires, or is otherwise voided, then the temporary certificate of concurrency will be rescinded and transportation capacity will not be reserved for that development.

H. If a land use permit is not required for a project, concurrency review will still occur. However, a final certificate of concurrency is issued instead of a temporary certificate of concurrency.

I. In the event that a development that has been issued a temporary certificate of concurrency is modified to generate increased PM peak hour trips, a new concurrency application and evaluation shall be required.

J. The determination of concurrency approval shall become final at the time of final construction permit approval as per SMC 11.50.090.

K. The issue of concurrency approval may be raised as part of any appeal of the land use permit for which the concurrency approval was granted. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.090 Final certificate of concurrency.

A. A final certificate of concurrency shall be issued upon final approval of the construction permits, or recording of final plat or final short plat, for which a temporary certificate of concurrency was issued.

B. The final certificate of concurrency will only be valid for the type and intensity of development that was approved by the City, unless concurrency approval also covered subsequent project phases, as identified in the temporary certificate of concurrency.

C. The final certificate of concurrency shall be adjusted to account for any reduction in traffic generation previously accounted for and reserved by the temporary certificate of concurrency.

D. If a proposed development project is modified during the review process and results in increased PM peak hour trips, then a new concurrency application, evaluation, approval, and temporary certificate of concurrency shall be required prior to issuance of a final certificate of concurrency.

E. The final certificate of concurrency shall include the following information:

1. The property address and King County Assessor’s parcel number(s) for the development project;

2. The number and type of dwelling units, square footage of commercial or industrial floor area, specific uses, densities, and intensities for which permit(s) were approved, including the number of PM peak hour trips generated by the development;

3. Mitigating measures required to ensure adequate transportation capacity for the approved development project, as approved by the Director;

4. An effective date; and

5. An expiration date.

F. A final certificate of concurrency shall be valid for the same time period as the construction permit, or final plat, or final short plat. If the approved construction permit, or plat, subsequently lapses, expires, or is otherwise voided, then the concurrency approval and final certificate of concurrency is rescinded and the project is removed from the concurrency register. If the construction permit approval or short plat does not have an expiration date, the final certificate of concurrency shall be valid for exactly five (5) years from the date issued.

G. The final certificate of concurrency may be extended by requesting a new issuance from the Director with an updated expiration date. The final certificate of concurrency can be extended to remain in effect for the life of each subsequent construction permit approval for the same property, as long as the applicant obtains the subsequent construction permit approval prior to the expiration of the first construction permit approval.

H. Once a project has received a certificate of occupancy for all buildings on the site or is otherwise complete, the final certificate of concurrency is valid for the life of the approved project.

I. The final certificate of concurrency runs with the property for which the certificate was issued and is valid only for subsequent development permit approvals for the same parcel. A final certificate of concurrency cannot be transferred to a different property and shall be limited to uses and intensities for which it was originally issued.

J. If at any point the property becomes vacant or the buildings are demolished, the final certificate of concurrency is valid for no more than five (5) years past the date of vacancy or demolition.

K. A final certificate of concurrency may be voluntarily surrendered or withdrawn by the owner of the property for which the certificate was issued. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.100 Denial of concurrency and mitigation.

A. If adequate transportation facilities are not available to serve a proposed development as identified in the concurrency evaluation, then the temporary certificate of concurrency shall not be issued.

B. If transportation concurrency is denied, the applicant may select one (1) of the following options:

1. Accept the denial of transportation concurrency. The project will be removed from subsequent concurrency evaluations, and the concurrency application will not be further processed by the Director.

2. Amend and resubmit the concurrency application within ninety (90) calendar-days of the denial.

a. The concurrency application may be amended to:

i. Reduce the scale and impact of the development project so the level of service standards on concurrency corridors are met with development of the project; or

ii. Phase the development project to match future construction of transportation infrastructure or services that will met the level of service standards; or

iii. Voluntarily arrange, by a financial commitment or instrument approved by the Director, to implement or construct transportation improvements or transportation demand management strategies needed to achieve concurrency. Transportation mitigation must be acceptable to the City in form and amount, to guarantee the applicant’s financial obligation for capital improvements to achieve concurrency approval for the development units.

3. Appeal the denial of concurrency and non-issuance of a temporary certificate of concurrency, pursuant to the provisions of SMC 11.50.150.

C. If a development that is consistent with the zoning provided in the comprehensive plan fails the concurrency evaluation, the City may review whether the underlying zoning is appropriate in the given area, as well as the feasibility of providing increased transportation capacity in the area, consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and projected six (6) year transportation improvement program funding. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.110 Concurrency management program administration – Purpose and procedure.

A. The concurrency management program shall be administered by the Director pursuant to this chapter.

B. The Director shall prepare administrative guidelines to assure the requirements of this chapter are implemented in a consistent and systematic process. The guidelines shall provide the basis for conducting the concurrency study and review of development applications including the concurrency application, evaluation, determination, and tracking of concurrency approvals and denials.

C. The director is responsible for reporting on whether the City’s transportation system is keeping up with development within the City, as well as reviewing, reassessing, and updating the concurrency program, on an as-needed basis. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.120 Relationship to street standards.

Neither compliance with this chapter or the payment of any fee hereunder shall replace the requirements related to City street standards pursuant to Chapter 11.05 SMC. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.130 Relationship to SEPA.

This chapter is not intended to limit the application of the State Environmental Policy Act to specific proposals. Each proposal shall be reviewed and may be conditioned or denied under the authority of the State Environmental Policy Act. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.140 Relationship to transportation impact fees.

Neither compliance with this chapter or the payment of any fee hereunder shall replace the requirements related to transportation impact fees pursuant to Chapter 11.15 SMC. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.150 Reconsiderations and appeals.

A. The applicant may request an administrative reconsideration of a concurrency determination.

B. Concurrency determinations cannot be reconsidered or appealed for the following reasons:

1. The methodology of the concurrency test in the comprehensive plan and in this title is incorrect;

2. The adopted level of service established in the comprehensive plan is incorrect; and

3. A provision of this title is incorrect or invalid.

C. Reconsiderations.

1. The applicant may request reconsideration of the results of the concurrency evaluation within fifteen (15) calendar days of the written notification of the evaluation results by filing a formal request for reconsideration specifying the grounds thereof, using forms authorized by the department.

2. The director shall reconsider the evaluation results and issue a determination within thirty (30) calendar days of the filing of such request either upholding the original determination or amending it.

D. Appeals.

1. Appeals of the concurrency determination shall first be made to the Director for reconsideration as per subsection (A) of this section.

2. If reconsideration is not granted and the original decision is not modified, an applicant or other person aggrieved by a concurrency determination (denial or approval) may file a formal appeal, pursuant to Chapter 16A.17 SMC.

3. The appeal of a concurrency determination will occur after all administrative permits related to the development activity are issued.

4. The concurrency determination appeal will be consolidated with any other administrative appeals as provided for in SMC 16A.19.020(G).

5. The City’s Hearing Examiner shall hear the concurrency determination appeal under the procedures set forth in Chapter 16A.17 SMC. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))


11.50.160 Fees.

A. The fees charged for reviewing and processing a concurrency application, including the concurrency evaluation, issuance of temporary and final certificates of concurrency, or appeal of concurrency evaluation denial, shall be as specified in the fee schedule as established by City Council ordinance.

B. Exemption from Concurrency Review and Processing Fees. City-owned facilities will be exempted from the concurrency review and processing fees provided in the unified fee schedule. City-owned facilities cannot be exempted from concurrency review by law. (Ord. 20-1001 § 1 (Exh. A) (part))

12.10.010 King County Surface Water Design Manual adopted by reference.

The 2016 King County Surface Water Design Manual (KCSWDM) and the City of SeaTac Addendum to the KCSWDM are hereby adopted by reference. They are collectively referred to in this title as the Surface Water Design Manual (SWDM). The above stormwater standards are adopted in compliance with the 2013 Western Washington (NPDES) Phase II Municipal Stormwater Permit. (Ord. 16-1021 § 1 (Appx. A) (part): Ord. 16-1006 § 1: Ord. 09-1042 § 1: Ord. 05-1012 § 1: Ord. 98-1054 § 1: Ord. 90-1046 § 1)


12.10.015 Definitions.

A. “Best management practice (BMP)” means any schedule of activities, prohibition of practices, maintenance procedures, or structural and/or managerial practices that, when used singly or in combination, prevents or reduces the release of pollutants and other adverse impacts to surface water, stormwater and groundwater, while minimizing the potential for flooding, soil creep and soil instability.

B. “Low impact development (LID)” means a stormwater and land use management strategy that strives to mimic natural hydrologic processes of infiltration, filtration, storage, evaporation and transpiration by emphasizing conservation, use of on-site natural features, site planning, and distributed stormwater management practices that are integrated into a project design, while also minimizing the potential for off-site flooding and soil instability.

C. “Low impact development (LID) best management practices (BMP)” means distributed stormwater management practices, integrated into a project design, that emphasize natural hydrologic processes of infiltration, filtration, storage, evaporation and transpiration, while protecting against off-site flooding and soil instability. LID BMPs include, but are not limited to, bioretention, permeable pavement, cast in place pavers, limited infiltration systems, roof downspout controls, dispersion, soil amendments, and minimal excavation foundations.

D. “Low impact development (LID) principles” means land use management strategies that emphasize conservation, use of on-site natural features, and site planning to utilize infiltration and native vegetation to minimize stormwater runoff, while protecting against remote area flooding and soil instability.

E. “Stormwater facilities” means drainage facilities or features used to meet water quality treatment and/or flow control requirements by utilizing processes such as infiltration, dispersion, storage, conveyance, evaporation, and transpiration.

F. “Surface Water Design Manual” means the King County Surface Water Design Manual (KCSWDM), as amended by the City of SeaTac Addendum to the KCSWDM adopted in SMC 12.10.010. (Ord. 16-1021 § 1 (Appx. A) (part))


12.10.020 Copy on file.

At least one (1) copy of the adopted edition of the Surface Water Design Manual, and any amendments thereto, shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk. (Ord. 09-1042 § 2: Ord. 98-1054 § 2: Ord. 95-1012 § 1: Ord. 90-1046 § 2)

Repealed by Ord. 98-1054. (Ord. 90-1046 § 5C)


12.10.075 Site planning and design.

The following site planning and design principles shall be applied where feasible: Site planning and design shall consider stormwater management, especially the design and integration of LID BMPs, as early as possible in the project planning phase; locate buildings away from soils that provide effective infiltration; site LID BMPs in areas with good infiltration capacity; reduce impervious surfaces and retain native vegetation. (Ord. 16-1021 § 1 (Appx. A) (part))


12.10.080 Critical drainage areas.

Development in areas where the Public Works Director has determined that the existing flooding, drainage, and/or erosion conditions present an imminent likelihood of harm to the welfare and safety of the surrounding community shall meet special drainage requirements set by the City Manager, or designee, until such time as the community hazard is alleviated. Such conditions may include the limitation of the volume of discharge from the subject property to predevelopment levels, preservation of wetlands or other natural drainage features, or other controls necessary to protect against community hazard. Where application of the provisions of this section will deny all reasonable uses of the property, the restriction of development contained in this section may be proposed for a variance; provided, that the resulting development shall be subject to all of the remaining terms and conditions of this chapter.

Repealed by Ord. 98-1054. (Ord. 90-1046 § 7)


12.10.100 Procedures and conditions related to construction timing and final approval.

A. No work related to permanent or temporary storm drainage control shall proceed without the approval of the City Manager, or designee.

B. Erosion/sedimentation control measures associated with both the interim and permanent drainage facilities shall be:

1. Constructed in accordance with the approved plan prior to any grading or land clearing other than that associated with the erosion/sedimentation control plan;

2. Satisfactorily maintained until all improvements, restoration, landscaping and other requirements of the Surface Water Design Manual are completed and the potential for on-site erosion has passed.

C. Prior to the construction of any improvements and/or buildings on the site, those portions of the stormwater facilities necessary to accommodate the control of surface and stormwater runoff discharge from the site must be constructed, approved, and functioning properly. Existing LID BMPs and proposed LID locations shall be protected throughout site construction to ensure that they are not compacted, damaged, or filled with sediments.

D. Subdivisions only: Recording may occur prior to the construction of drainage facilities when approved in writing by the City Manager, or designee, but only to minimize impacts that may result from construction during inappropriate times of the year. (Ord. 16-1021 § 1 (Appx. A) (part): Ord. 00-1015 § 1: Ord. 95-1012 § 1: Ord. 90-1046 § 8)


12.10.110 Bonds and liability insurance required.

The City Manager, or designee, is authorized to require all persons constructing stormwater flow control and/or treatment facilities to post bonds. Where such persons have previously posted, or are required to post, other bonds covering either the facility itself or other construction related to the facility, such person may, with the permission of the Public Works Director, or designee, and to the extent allowable by law, combine all such bonds into a single bond; provided, that at no time shall the amount thus bonded be less than the total amount which would have been required in the form of separate bonds; and provided further, that such bond shall on its face clearly delineate those separate bonds which it is intended to replace. (Ord. 16-1021 § 1 (Appx. A) (part): Ord. 95-1012 § 1: Ord. 90-1046 § 9 (intro.))


12.10.120 Stormwater facilities restoration and site stabilization bond.

Prior to commencing construction, the permittee shall post a stormwater facilities restoration and site stabilization bond (performance bond) in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of corrective work on or off the site which is necessary to provide adequate drainage, stabilize and restore disturbed areas, and remove sources of hazard associated with work which has been performed and is not completed. After determination by the Public Works Director, or designee, that all facilities are constructed in compliance with approved plans, the performance bond shall be released. The City may collect against the performance bond when work is not completed in reasonable fashion and is found to be in violation of the conditions of the Surface Water Design Manual.

12.10.210 Appointment of surface water management authority.

The City’s Department of Public Works is designated as the City’s agent for providing drainage and surface water management services under the surface water management program to the residents and property owners of the City. (Ord. 98-1054 § 5: Ord. 92-1004 § 1: Ord. 90-1016 § 1)


12.10.215 Appointment of King County as collecting and disbursing agent.

Pursuant to interlocal agreement, King County and its Surface Water Management Division and its Office of Financial Management are designated as the City’s agents for the purpose of collecting surface water service charges from City property owners and disbursing funds to the City, and also to provide surface water management technical support services. A copy of the interlocal agreement shall be available in the office of the City Clerk for use and examination by the public. (Ord. 92-1004 § 2)


12.10.220 Surface water management program.

A. There is hereby created and established a Surface Water Utility and surface water management program, implementation of which shall be governed by the Surface Water Design Manual adopted pursuant to SMC 12.10.010.

B. The surface water management program is necessary in order to promote public health, safety and welfare by establishing and operating a comprehensive approach to surface and storm water problems which would reduce flooding, erosion and sedimentation, prevent and mitigate habitat loss, enhance groundwater recharge and prevent water quality degradation. This comprehensive approach includes the following elements: basin and subbasin planning, land use regulation, construction of facilities, maintenance, public education, and provision of surface water management services. The most cost effective and beneficial approach to surface water management is through preventative actions and protection of the natural drainage system. In approaching surface water problems the surface water management program shall give priority to methods which provide protection or enhancement of the natural surface water drainage system, such as LID BMPs and principles which promote infiltration and dispersion, over methods which primarily involve construction of traditional drainage facilities or systems, such as detention pipes, vaults, and ponds. The purpose of the rates and charges established at SMC 12.10.225 is to provide a method for payment of all or any part of the cost and expense of surface water management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such services and facilities. These rates and charges are necessary in order to promote the public health, safety and welfare by minimizing uncontrolled surface and storm water, erosion, and water pollution; to preserve and utilize the many values of the City’s natural drainage system including water quality, open space, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, education, urban separation and drainage facilities; and to provide for the comprehensive management and administration of surface water.

C. The following sections of Chapter 9.08 King County Code as now in effect, and as may be subsequently amended, are adopted by reference, except that, unless the context indicates otherwise, the word “County” and the words “King County” shall refer to the City, and references to County codes shall be deemed references to the Surface Water Design Manual or Municipal Code, as applicable: 

	9.08.060(B) through (L) and (N) through (Q)	Policy.

	9.08.090	Billing procedure.

(Ord. 16-1021 § 1 (Appx. A) (part): Ord. 99-1042 § 3: Ord. 93-1045 § 1: Ord. 92-1007 § 1: Ord. 92-1004 § 3: Ord. 90-1016 § 2)


12.10.225 Rate structure.

A. Surface water management service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of increased surface and storm water runoff from a given parcel to the surface and storm water management system, a pro rata share of City-wide surface water management services, and the policy considerations adopted at SMC 12.10.220. The percentage of impervious surfaces on the parcel and the total parcel acreage will be used to indicate the relative contribution of increased surface and storm water runoff from the parcel to the surface and storm water management system. The relative contribution of increased surface and storm water runoff from each parcel determines that parcel’s share of the program’s revenue needs. The service charge revenue needs of the program are based upon all or any part, as determined by the Council with advice of the Department of Public Works, of the cost and expense within the service area of maintaining and operating surface water control facilities, all or any part of the cost and expense of planning, designing, establishing, acquiring, developing, constructing, and improving any of such facilities, or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such purpose.

B. The Department of Public Works shall determine the service charge for each parcel within the service area by the following methodology: Residential parcels shall receive a flat rate. Parcels shall be classified into the appropriate rate category in subsection C of this section by their percentage of impervious surface coverage. Land use codes and data collected from parcel investigations will be used to determine each parcel’s percentage of impervious surface coverage. After a parcel has been assigned to the appropriate rate category, the service charge for the parcel will be calculated by multiplying the total acreage of the parcel times the rate of that category.

C. There is imposed upon all developed properties in the service area annual service charges as identified below effective January 1, 2014, and increased thereafter by 34.65 percent (34.65%) on January 1, 2015, 4.88 percent (4.88%) on January 1, 2017, and 6.55 percent (6.55%) on January 1, 2018:

Impervious Surface 

	Class	Percentage	 Rate 

	Residential (R) *	NA	$99.63/parcel/year

	Very Light (VL)	0 – 10%	$59.56/acre/year

E. If the Director finds that a service charge bill has been undercharged, then either an amended bill shall be issued which reflects the increase in the service charge or the undercharged amount will be added to the next year’s bill. The Director may include in the bill the amount undercharged for two (2) previous billing years in addition to the current bill.

F. Decisions of the Director on requests for rate adjustments shall be final unless, within thirty (30) days of the date the decision was mailed, the applicant submits in writing to the Director a notice of appeal setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for appeal and requesting a hearing before the City Hearing Examiner. The Examiner’s decision shall be a final decision. (Ord. 16-1007 § 13; Ord. 99-1042 § 5)


12.10.230 Delinquencies and foreclosures.

Delinquent service charges shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the date of delinquency until paid. The City shall have a lien for delinquent service charges, including interest thereon, against any property subject to service charges. The lien shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances except general taxes and local and special assessments. Such lien shall be effective as to a total amount not in excess of one (1) year’s delinquent charges without necessity for any writing or recording of the lien. (Ord. 99-1042 § 6: Ord. 90-1016 § 3)

12.40.020 Definitions.

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

A. “Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the flood plain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

B. “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.

C. “Development” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard.

D. “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or

2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

E. “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.

F. “Flood Insurance Study” means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.

G. “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.

H. “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of Section 12.40.090A of this code.

I. “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance, purposes the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.

J. “New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter.

K. “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

L. “Structure” means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

M. “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:

1. Before the improvement or repair is started; or

2. If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

4. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least 50 lots or 5 acres (whichever is less).

E. Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (Section 12.40.070B), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. (Ord. 93-1022 § 1)


12.40.090 Specific standards for flood hazard reduction.

In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 12.40.040, Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard or Section 12.40.070(B), Use of Other Base Flood Data, the following provisions are required:

1. Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

2. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

3. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section 12.40.070C(2) of this code;

4. Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed, must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in Section 12.40.090A(2) of this code;

5. Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level (e.g. a building constructed to the base flood level will be rated as one foot below that level).

C. Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within appropriate zones of the City shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured homes is at or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.40.080A(2) of this code. (Ord. 93-1022 § 1)


12.40.100 Floodways.

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 12.40.040 of this code are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within designated floodways, except for (1) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor areas; and (2) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which does not exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure either, (a) before the repair, reconstruction, or repair is started, or (b) if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Work done on structures to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety codes or to structures identified as historic places shall not be included in the 50 percent.

C. If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 12.40.080, 12.40.090, and 12.40.100 of this code. (Ord. 93-1022 § 1)

(Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.100.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the context thereof shall clearly indicate to the contrary:

A. “Building official” means the person charged with the administration and enforcement of the technical codes or a regularly authorized deputy. The authority of this position is held by the Building Services Manager.

B. “Building service equipment” means the plumbing, mechanical, electrical and elevator equipment, fire suppression systems, fuel tanks, including piping, wiring, fixtures and other accessories which provide sanitation, lighting, power, heating, ventilation, cooling, refrigeration, fire-fighting and transportation facilities essential to the occupancy of the building or structure for its designated use.

C. “Dwelling” means a building that contains one (1) or two (2) dwelling units used, intended or designed to be used, rented, leased, let or hired out to be occupied for living purposes.

D. “Technical codes” means those codes adopted by this title containing the provisions for design, construction, alteration, moving, demolition, repair, removal, use, location, occupancy and maintenance of buildings, structures and building service equipment. Where no applicable standards or requirements are set forth in this title, or are contained within other laws, codes, regulations, ordinances or bylaws adopted by the City of SeaTac, technical codes may also include applicable standards of the National Fire Protection Association or other nationally recognized standards approved by the Building Official.

E. “Valuation” or “value” means, as applied to a building and its building service equipment, the estimated cost to replace the building and its building service equipment in kind, based on current replacement costs. (Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.100.030 Modifications.

Wherever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the provisions of the technical codes, the Building Official shall have the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, upon a request by the owner or owner’s representative, provided the Building Official shall first find that a special individual reason makes the strict letter of this code impractical and the modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose of the technical codes and that such modification does not lessen health, accessibility, life and fire safety, or structural requirements. The details of any action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in the files of the Building Division. (Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.100.040 Alternate materials, design and methods of construction and equipment.

A. The provisions of the technical codes are not intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by the technical codes; provided, that any such alternative has been approved. An alternative material, design or method of construction shall be approved where the Building Official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory, complies with the intent of the provisions of the technical codes, and that the material, method, or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical codes in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety.

B. Research Reports. Supporting data, where necessary to assist in the approval of materials or assemblies not specifically provided for in the technical codes, shall consist of valid research reports from approved sources.

C. Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of the technical codes, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the requirements of technical codes, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the Building Official shall have the authority to require tests as evidence of compliance to be made at no expense to the City of SeaTac. Test methods shall be as specified in the technical codes or by other recognized test standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test methods, the Building Official shall approve the testing procedures. Tests shall be performed by an approved agency.

The Building Official shall have the authority to render interpretations of the technical codes, except for the Grading Code and Fire Code and to adopt policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of their provisions. The Fire Chief, or designee, is responsible for the enforcement and interpretation of the Fire Code. The Director of Community and Economic Development or designee is responsible for the enforcement and interpretation of the Grading Code. Such interpretations, policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the intent and purpose of the technical codes. Such policies and procedures shall not have the effect of waiving requirements specifically provided for in the technical codes.

B. Inspections. The Building Official shall make all of the required inspections, or the Building Official shall have the authority to accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or individuals. Reports of such inspections shall be in writing and be certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency or by the responsible individual. The Building Official is authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that arise.

C. Identification. The Building Official shall carry proper identification when inspecting structures or premises in the performance of duties under the technical codes.

D. Right of Entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of the technical codes, or where the Building Official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in a structure or upon a premises a condition which is contrary to or in violation of the technical codes which makes the structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the Building Official is authorized to enter the structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect or to perform the duties imposed by the technical codes; provided, that if such structure or premises be occupied, that credentials be presented to the occupant and entry requested. If such structure or premises is unoccupied, the Building Official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the structure or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the Building Official shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law to secure entry.

E. Department Records. The Building Official shall keep official records of applications received, permits and certificates issued, fees collected, reports of inspections, and notices and orders issued. Such records shall be retained in the official records for the period required for retention of public records by the City’s retention schedule. (Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.100.060 Permits.

A. Except for those items specifically exempt in each of the technical codes, no building, structure or building service equipment regulated by the technical codes shall be erected, constructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, moved, improved, removed, converted or demolished unless a separate, appropriate permit for each building, structure or building service equipment has first been obtained from the Building Official. Exemptions from permit requirements of the technical codes shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of those codes or any other laws or ordinances of the City of SeaTac or the State of Washington.

B. Emergency Repairs. Where equipment replacements and repairs must be performed in an emergency situation, the permit application shall be submitted within the next working business day to the Building Official.

C. Repairs. Application or notice to the Building Official is not required for ordinary repairs to structures, replacement of lamps or the connection of approved portable electrical equipment to approved permanently installed receptacles. Such repairs shall not include the cutting away of any wall, partition or portion thereof, the removal or cutting of any structural beam or load-bearing support, or the removal or change of any required means of egress, or rearrangement of parts of a structure affecting the egress requirements; nor shall ordinary repairs include addition to, alteration of, replacement, or relocation of any standpipe, water supply, sewer, drainage, drain leader, gas, soil, waste, vent or similar piping, fire suppression, electric wiring, mechanical or other work affecting public health or general safety.

D. Application for Permit. In order to obtain a permit for work regulated by this title, the applicant shall first file a completed application in writing on a form furnished by the City for that purpose. Along with the application, the applicant shall also submit related application and construction documents to include all other data, plans, specifications, calculations and information as required by the City or by the State of Washington. No action or review will be taken by the City if the application or application and construction documents are incomplete.

E. Action on Application. The Building Official shall review or cause to be reviewed applications and any required construction documents for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing. If the application or the construction documents do not conform to the requirements of pertinent laws, the Building Official shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Building Official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of the technical codes and laws and ordinances applicable thereto, and all required fees associated with the permit have been paid to the City, the Building Official shall issue a permit as soon as practicable.

F. Time Limitation of Application.

1. Applications for which no permit is issued within eighteen (18) months following the date of application shall expire by limitation and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed in accordance with State law.

2. Applications may be canceled for inactivity if an applicant fails to respond to the department’s written request for revisions, corrections, actions or additional information within ninety (90) days of the date of request. The Building Official may extend the response period beyond ninety (90) days if within the original ninety (90) day time period the applicant provides and subsequently adheres to an approved schedule with specific target dates for submitting the full revisions, corrections or other information needed by the department.

G. Validity of Permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of the technical codes or of any other ordinance of the City of SeaTac. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of the technical codes or other ordinances of the City of SeaTac shall not be valid. The issuance of a permit based on construction documents and other data shall not prevent the Building Official from requiring the correction of errors in the construction documents and other data. The Building Official is also authorized to prevent occupancy or use of a structure when in violation of this code or other ordinances of the City of SeaTac.

H. Expiration of Permits.

1. Every permit issued shall expire two (2) years from the date of issuance. The Building Official may approve a request for an extended expiration date where a construction schedule is provided by the applicant and approved prior to permit issuance.

2. Every permit that has been expired for one (1) year or less may be renewed for a period of one (1) year for an additional fee as long as no changes have been made to the originally approved plans. For permits that have been expired for longer than one (1) year, a new permit must be obtained and new fees paid. No permit shall be renewed more than once.

3. Electrical, mechanical and plumbing permits shall expire at the same time as the associated building permit except that if no associated building permit is issued, the electrical, mechanical and/or plumbing permit shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days from issuance.

4. The Building Official may grant a thirty (30) day extension to an expired permit for the purpose of performing a final inspection and closing out the permit as long as not more than one hundred eighty (180) days has passed since the permit expired. The thirty (30) day extension would commence on the date of written approval, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the plans or scope of work. If work required under a final inspection is not completed within the thirty (30) day extension period, the permit shall expire. However, the Building Official may authorize an additional thirty (30) day extension if conditions outside of the applicant’s control exist and the applicant is making good effort to complete the permitted work.

I. Suspension or Revocation. The Building Official is authorized to suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this title whenever the permit was issued in error or on the basis of incorrect, inaccurate, or incomplete information, or in violation of any ordinance or regulation or any of the provisions of the technical codes.

J. Placement of Permit. The permit shall be kept on the site of the work until the completion of the project. (Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 10-1018 § 1: Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.100.070 Permit and plan review fees.

A. A permit shall not be valid until all fees owed to the City of SeaTac have been paid nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, has been paid.

Project valuations shall include total value of work, including materials and labor, for which the permit is being issued such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other permanent systems. The project valuation shall be set by the Building Official.

The valuation shall be based on the most recent Table 1 and Table 2 of the Building Valuation Data published by the International Code Council or the actual value of the work, whichever is higher. In addition to the regional modifier, the valuation may be reduced by the following multipliers:

	Residential additions	.70

	Residential remodels	.30

	Residential decks	.20

	Commercial remodels	.30

C. Work Commencing Before Permit Issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, fuel tank, mechanical, plumbing or fire suppression system before obtaining the necessary permits shall be subject to an investigation fee as determined by the Building Official. The fee shall be an amount equal to the permit fee with a minimum fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00). The investigation fee shall be in addition to the required permit fee.

D. Refunds. The Building Official may authorize refunding any fee paid hereunder which was erroneously paid or collected. The Building Official may authorize the refunding of not more than eighty percent (80%) of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under the permit. The Building Official may authorize the refunding of not more than eighty percent (80%) of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been done is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing has been done. (Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.100.100 Appeals.

Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order, and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume. (Ord. 16-1008 § 1 (part): Ord. 04-1016 § 2)

Sections:

13.250.010    Purpose.

13.250.020    Application.

13.250.030    Residential requirements.

13.250.040    Nonresidential requirements.

13.250.050    Location guidelines.

13.250.060    Design guidelines.


13.250.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that new construction incorporates the space required for on-site storage of recyclables prior to pickup and removal by haulers by:

A. Establishing mandatory minimum recyclables storage space requirements for residential and nonresidential projects; and

B. Providing location and design guidelines which will assist the applicant in the development of such storage spaces without unduly limiting creative solutions. (Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.250.020 Application.

All new development after the adoption of these regulations, with the exception of single-family homes, shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter.

“Storage areas for recyclables” shall be considered as separate from “interim recycling facility” as defined in the King County Code. Only material generated on-site shall be collected and stored in such areas, and the primary processing shall be conducted off-site. (Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.250.030 Residential requirements.

A. Minimum space requirements of one and one-half (1 1/2) square feet per unit in all residential projects with the exception of single-family homes. Those multifamily developments which will receive direct collection through a City-sponsored or approved program may be exempted from these requirements.

B. One (1) collection area per thirty (30) units, to be located not more than two hundred (200) feet, or the distance to the garbage collection storage area, from the intended user units. (Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.250.040 Nonresidential requirements.

A. Office: two (2) square feet of storage space for every one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area.

B. Retail: five (5) square feet of storage space for every one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area.

C. General commercial (including wholesale, warehouse, and industrial): three (3) square feet of storage space for every one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area.

D. Educational and Institutional: two (2) square feet of storage space for every one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area. (Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.250.050 Location guidelines.

A. Location Generally. The storage area for recyclables shall be located in an area which is accessible to the intended users in order to encourage its use. It may be located either inside or outside the proposed building.

To encourage its use, the storage area should be located adjacent to or near the waste storage and collection areas. The storage and collection of waste and recyclables should be designed to complement each other and to operate as one (1) system.

Exterior storage areas for recyclables shall not be located in any setback.

The location of the storage area must not interfere with the primary use of the site, which could discourage the use of the storage area. It should not be located in areas which cannot tolerate noise, odor, and increased pedestrian and vehicle traffic.

B. Subdivision of Required Space. In nonresidential zones, the total area required can be broken into smaller areas and distributed around the development site if desired, but each area must maintain a useful minimum space.

In residential projects comprising more than one (1) building, the total space must be divided, following the ratio of one (1) storage area per thirty (30) residential units. Each storage area should be located not more than two hundred (200) feet, or the distance to the garbage collection storage area, from the units it is intended to serve.

C. Signage. The recycling area should be clearly marked as such, with signs not to exceed two (2) square feet.

D. On-Site Circulation. The storage facility should be located so that trucks shall not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic movement, or project into any public right-of-way. (Ord. 04-1008 § 3)


13.250.060 Design guidelines.

A. Design Generally. It is the intent of these guidelines to assist the applicant in developing creative designs for storage space.

1. The design of the storage area should be consistent with the architectural design of the primary structure(s) on the site.

2. Dimensions of the storage area shall accommodate containers consistent with current methods of collection.

B. Enclosure. In order to limit the dispersal of litter on-site, storage areas in all zones shall be enclosed by fence or wall of six (6) feet in height. This requirement shall not apply to storage areas in industrial zones, unless the storage area is located within one hundred (100) feet of residentially zoned property. Gate openings which allow access by user and by haulers should be included. Gate opening for haulers should be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide. The storage areas should be designed to be easily accessible to collection trucks and equipment. Adequate vertical clearance (if the space is located within a structure) and adequate turning radius must be provided to accommodate collection equipment.

C. Landscaping. Landscaping is required in accordance with the City of SeaTac requirements for new development. Such landscaping shall be required in nonresidential zones only if the storage area will be within one hundred (100) feet of residentially zoned property. The landscaping should be designed so as not to impede access to the storage area.

D. Weather Protection. 

1. In order to ensure that the efficiency of recycling efforts and to maintain the value of the commodities, storage containers shall be shown to be protected from weather damage. This can be accomplished either by using weather-proof containers or by covering the storage area.

2. If the storage area is to be roofed, it must be shown to be accessible to haulers. Minimum opening spaces should be twelve (12) feet high and twelve (12) feet wide.

E. Security and Access. Access to the storage areas can be limited for security reasons, but must be accessible to haulers and users during regular business and collection hours. (Ord. 04-1008 § 3)

14.22.010 Purpose

This chapter is established to:

A.    Provide an optional subdivision process by which consolidated commercial, industrial, mobile home or condominium uses may be developed in a manner that is qualitatively equivalent to, or better than, traditional lot-by-lot development. 

B.    Integrate planned unit development procedures specified under Chapter 15.215 SMC with a complementary subdivision process so that resulting lots, tracts, or parcels may be better planned and operated as parts of a single commercial, industrial, mobile home or condominium development.

C.    Allow the Director flexibility in the application of specific zoning and lot configuration requirements as they may apply interior to the site, provided all resulting development is consistent with applicable health, fire and building codes.

D.    Allow the Director to authorize the sharing of open space, parking, access and other improvements between contiguous properties where developed for the same purpose.

E.    Minimize the need for variances or other special regulatory procedures where development sites are characterized by peculiar geographic, topographic or dimensional features. (Ord. 18-1008 § 1; Ord. 16-1007 § 25; Ord. 09-1012 § 1 (Exh. A))

B.    Each lot established or modified consistent with this chapter shall be considered a legal lot of record under this title.

C.    A binding site plan establishes or alters lots, tracts, or parcels and determines specific requirements for their future coordinated development. Approval of a binding site plan shall not in itself authorize the establishment of any specific use thereon.

D.    Binding site plan applications may be considered for either vacant properties or for the redevelopment of sites that support ongoing uses. 

E.    Binding site planning shall result in no less than two (2) contiguous lots.

F.    The binding site plan shall ensure that the collective lots continue to function as one (1) site with respect to, but not limited to, lot access, interior circulation, open space, landscaping, drainage facilities, facility maintenance and parking.

G.    The approved lot configuration of a binding site plan, and all associated provisions, conditions and requirements, shall be legally enforceable upon each current and subsequent owner, purchaser, lessee or other person acquiring an ownership interest of any subject lot, parcel, or tract.

H.    The site plan shall be supported by written covenants, descriptions and similar instruments, in a format determined by the Director. These instruments shall set forth all applicable limitations and conditions, including dedications of property, and shall contain provisions assuring that any development of the site shall remain in conformity with the approved binding site plan.

I.    The applicant’s decision to participate in binding site planning is optional. The City may ask binding site plan applicants to provide a written waiver of the ninety (90) day time limit for review associated with subdivisions. In such a case, the City and applicant shall arrive at a written agreement as to the appropriate duration of site plan review. Nothing in this provision shall be construed as compelling the applicant to provide such a waiver. (Ord. 18-1008 § 1; Ord. 09-1012 § 1 (Exh. A))


14.22.030 Vacation or Dissolution 

A.    Where a binding site plan is considered concurrently with a planned unit development, pursuant with Chapter 15.215 SMC, the applicant must receive preliminary approval of the binding site plan no later than the date on which a first phase development plan or comprehensive development plan is submitted to the City. Failure to meet this requirement shall void any approval under this chapter.

B.    Where any portion of a concurrent planned unit development or building permit expires or is otherwise voided, the corresponding binding site plan shall be vacated in direct proportion.

C.    Where any portion of a binding site plan is vacated, expires or is otherwise voided, that vacated portion shall constitute a single and legally separate lot. This lot shall revert to the original zoning of the site and all associated standards shall apply.

D.    Once a binding site plan is recorded, the approved lot configuration and all related provisions shall apply until such time as a subsequent subdivision or binding site plan is approved for the site.

D.    The restrictive covenant shall require that, in the event the City decides to construct the improvements as part of a public works project, the current or future property owners pay the City their pro-rata share of the cost of the project.

1.    Their pro-rata share of that project shall be computed by determining the assessment applicable to the original undivided parcel, and then proportionately allocating that assessment between each lot created by short subdivision. (Ord. 18-1008 § 1; Ord. 09-1012 § 1 (Exh. A))

15.115.005 Purpose

The purposes of this chapter are to allow for consistent evaluation of land use applications and any other quasi-judicial matters considered by the Hearing Examiner pursuant to the applicable ordinances and authority. This chapter also details decision criteria for administrative variances and minor conditional use permits rendered by the Director.

The criteria in this chapter are intended to protect nearby properties from the possible effects of land use requests subject to discretionary land use permits by:

A.    Providing clear criteria on which to base a decision;

B.    Recognizing the effects of unique circumstances upon the development potential of a property;

C.    Avoiding the granting of special privileges; 

D.    Avoiding development which may be unnecessarily detrimental to neighboring properties;

E.    Requiring that the design, scope and intensity of development is in keeping with the physical aspects of a site and adopted land use policies for the area; and

F.    Providing criteria which emphasize protection of the general character of neighborhoods. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.115.010 Variance

A.    A variance is a request for an exception to the development standards of the code because of special circumstances (i.e., size, shape, topography of lot) when the strict application of the code deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other similar properties. A variance may be granted when a hardship is proven. A variance cannot be used for relief from types of uses permitted within zone classifications.

B.    The applicant must show that the proposed development issue requiring a variance meets all of the following criteria for approval, except as specified in subsection (D) of this section:

1.    The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property on behalf of which the application was filed is located; and

2.    That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances relating to the size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with use rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located; and

3.    That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated; and

4.    That the special circumstances necessitating the variance have not resulted from any action of the applicant; and

5.    That the requested variance will not create a use not generally permitted within the zone in which the subject property is located.

C.    The requested variance is decided by the City’s Hearing Examiner through a public hearing process, except in cases where the requested change involves less than twenty percent (20%) variance to a standard. In these cases, the variance may be decided by the Director, provided the following criteria are met in addition to those in subsection (B) of this section:

1.    The variance does not reasonably involve a life/safety issue nor does it reasonably involve damage to or loss of property of any person or entity.

2.    The person or entity requesting the requirements change shall agree to waive all rights to pursue a variance or other process to seek an alternative to the requirements of the City Code; provided, that if no change in the requirements of the City Code is granted to such person or entity, the person or entity would be entitled to pursue a variance or other available procedure in the normal course.

D.    A variance from the standards for WCF regarding height, aesthetics (including concealment), equipment enclosures and the dimensions of freestanding poles specified in Chapter 15.480 SMC, Wireless Communications Facilities, may be granted by the Hearing Examiner only in situations where all of the following criteria are met. These criteria shall apply in lieu of those specified in subsection (B) of this section.

1.    The specified standard would have the effect of precluding the provision of commercial wireless communication service;

2.    The variance is necessary to protect a property right possessed by others;

3.    The variance will not harm the public welfare of adjacent properties;

4.    The requested variance will not create a use not generally permitted within the zone classification in which the subject property is located;

5.    The variance is the minimum necessary to grant relief to the applicant;

6.    Any request for a variance from the standards regarding height, aesthetics, equipment enclosures and dimensions of freestanding poles specified in Chapter 15.480 SMC, Wireless Communications Facilities, shall include a written report that specifies:

a.    The necessity of the site to provide the communication coverage required by the applicant; and

b.    The necessity of the requested variance as the minimum necessary to provide the communication coverage required by the applicant; and

c.    An assessment of all possible alternatives that could meet the service provider’s system coverage requirements. The alternatives assessment shall include alternative sites, alternative antenna types, and any other mechanism that could make the variance unnecessary in terms of meeting the service provider’s system coverage needs. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.115.020 Conditional Use Permit (CUP)

A.    Major Conditional Use Permit. A major conditional use permit (CUP) is a permit granted by the Hearing Examiner, which sets special conditions regarding a use in a zone where the use is not permitted outright due to the nature of impacts created by the use. 

B.    Minor Conditional Use Permit. A minor conditional use permit may be granted by the Director to allow specified uses as listed under subsection (E) of this section.

C.    The CUP process is a means of imposing special conditions and requirements on development, so that the compatibility of uses shall be maintained considering other existing and potential uses within the general area where the conditional use is proposed. Conditions imposed on a CUP will reasonably assure that a nuisance or hazard to life or property will not occur. The CUP process is not a means to reduce the requirements of a zone classification where the conditional use is proposed.

D.    The applicant must show that the proposed development satisfies all of the following criteria for approval by the Hearing Examiner or Director:

1.    The proposed use is listed as a conditional use under SMC 15.205.040, Use Chart;

2.    The site is adequate in size and shape for the proposed project and the use conforms to the general character of the neighborhood;

3.    The unique character of topography, arterial streets and adjacent land use complement the proposed conditional use;

4.    The conditional use would not be detrimental to surrounding land use;

5.    Modifications to standards are limited to those which will mitigate impacts in a manner equal to or greater than the standards of this code;

6.    The conditional use is such that pedestrian and vehicular traffic associated with the use will not be hazardous or conflict with existing and anticipated traffic in the neighborhood; and

7.    The conditional use will be supported by adequate public facilities or services, and will not adversely affect public services to the surrounding area unless conditions can be established to mitigate adverse impacts.

E.    A minor conditional use permit may be granted by the Director only in the following situations:

1.    The minor conditional use must conform to the criteria as set forth in this section and all other requirements of this code.

2.    To allow the expansion of an existing, legal conditional use which has previously been permitted within the zone classification, provided the requested expansion of the existing conditional use is either:

a.    No greater than twenty percent (20%) of the gross floor area of the existing conditional use; and

b.    Exempt from environmental review under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).

3.    To allow location of a new concealed freestanding WCF in a low intensity zone, subject to the requirements set forth in Chapter 15.480 SMC, Wireless Communications Facilities.

4.    To allow uses in school facilities or City facilities within the residential zones and Park zone. See criteria in Chapter 15.470 SMC, Subsidiary Uses. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.115.030 Development Agreements

A.    A person or entity having ownership or control of real property within the City may file an application for a development agreement with the Department, solely and exclusively on the current form approved by the said Department, together with the filing fee set forth in the current edition of the City’s Fee Schedule as adopted by resolution of the City Council.

B.    Terms of the proposed development agreement shall be subject to the Development Review Committee process set forth at SMC 16A.05.020, Preapplication Meetings, and such other provisions of SMC Title 16A, Development Review Code, as may be deemed appropriate by the City.

C.    The Director is authorized, but not required, to negotiate acceptable terms and conditions of the proposed development agreement with due regard for the following criteria:

1.    The development agreement conforms to the existing Comprehensive Plan policies.

2.    The terms of the development agreement are generally consistent with the development regulations of the City then in effect.

3.    Appropriate project or proposal elements such as permitted uses, residential densities, and nonresidential densities and intensities or structure sizes are adequately provided, to include evidence that the site is adequate in size and shape for the proposed project or use, conforms to the general character of the neighborhood, and would be compatible with adjacent land uses.

4.    Appropriate provisions are made for the amount and payment of impact fees imposed or agreed to in accordance with any applicable provisions of State law, any reimbursement provisions, other financial contributions by the property owner, inspection fees, or dedications.

5.    Adequate mitigation measures, development conditions, and mitigation requirements under Chapter 43.21C RCW are provided.

6.    Adequate and appropriate design standards such as maximum heights, setbacks, drainage and water quality requirements, landscaping, and other development features are provided.

7.    If applicable, targets and requirements regarding affordable housing are addressed.

8.    Provisions are sufficient to assure requirements of parks and open space preservation.

9.    Interim uses and phasing of development and construction is appropriately provided. In the case of an interim use of a parcel of property, deferments or departures from development regulations may be allowed without providing a demonstrated benefit to the City; provided, that any departures or deferments to the code requested for a final use of the property shall comply with criteria No. 11 below. The agreement shall clearly state the conditions under which the interim use shall be converted to a permanent use within a stated time period and the penalties for noncompliance if the interim use is not converted to the permanent use in the stated period of time.

10.    Where a phased development agreement is proposed, a site plan shall be provided and shall clearly show the proposed interim and final use subject to the agreement.

11.    In the case of a development agreement where the proposed use would be the final use of the property, it shall be clearly documented that any departures to the standards of the code, requested by the applicant, are in the judgment of the City, offset by providing a benefit to the City of equal or greater value relative to the departure requested. In no case shall a departure to the code be granted if no benefit to the City is proposed in turn by the applicant.

12.    Conditions are set forth providing for review procedures and standards for implementing decisions.

13.    A build-out or vesting period for applicable standards is provided.

14.    Any other appropriate development requirements or procedures necessary to the specific project or proposal are adequately addressed.

15.    If appropriate, and if the applicant is to fund or provide public facilities, the development agreement shall contain appropriate provisions for reimbursement over time to the applicant.

16.    Appropriate statutory authority exists for any involuntary obligation of the applicant to fund or provide services, infrastructure, impact fees, inspection fees, dedications, or other service or financial contributions.

D.    If the Director deems that an acceptable development agreement has been negotiated and recommends the same for consideration, the City Council shall hold a public hearing and then may take final action, by resolution, to authorize entry into the development agreement. In addition, the Council may continue the hearing for the purpose of clarifying issues, or obtaining additional information, facts, or documentary evidence.

E.    The decision of the Council shall be final immediately upon adoption of a resolution authorizing or rejecting the development agreement.

F.    Following approval of a development agreement by the Council, and execution of the same, the development agreement shall be recorded with the King County Recorder.

G.    Because a development agreement is not necessary to any given project or use of real property under the existing comprehensive plan and development regulations in effect at the time of making application, approval of a development agreement is wholly discretionary and any action taken by the City Council is legislative only, and not quasi-judicial. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.115.040 Essential Public Facilities

A.    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a formal process for identifying and siting of essential public facilities (EPFs).

B.    Included Essential Public Facilities. EPFs subject to this section include, but are not limited to, those facilities identified in the EPF definition (SMC 15.105.050), the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Interstate 5, State Route 509 (both current and proposed extensions), State Route 518, the Federal Detention Center, the King County Bow Lake Solid Waste Transfer Station, and the Sound Transit’s “LINK” Light Rail System.

C.    Threshold Review. During or within forty-five (45) days subsequent to the mandatory preapplication Development Review Committee meeting required by SMC 16A.05.020, Preapplication Meetings, the Director shall make a threshold determination, and advise the potential applicant in writing of such determination, whether the proposed project is an EPF and, if so, whether it is difficult to site. In making said determinations, the Director shall broadly and liberally apply the definition of an EPF in consideration of the full range of proposed and potential services to be provided to the public, whether provided directly by, funded by, or contracted for by a governmental agency, or provided by a private entity or entities subject to public service obligations. The determination of whether an EPF will be difficult to site shall be made by the Director upon known or reasonably perceived and articulable facts. Proposed projects determined not to be EPFs, and proposed projects determined to be EPFs but also determined to be not difficult of siting, shall be reviewed and processed as any other similar project pursuant to the City Development Code without regard to this section.

These requirements shall not be construed to limit the appropriate use of schools and other facilities for emergency shelters in disaster situations. 

D.    Applications for EPF Projects. All proposed projects determined to be EPFs and determined to be difficult to site or expand shall be reviewed and conditioned in accordance with all requirements of this code and, in addition, with the conditional use permit procedure, herein referred to as the CUP-EPF review procedure. All applications shall contain the following information:

1.    A detailed written description of the proposed and potential public services to be provided, the source or sources of funding, and identification of any applicable public regulatory agencies;

2.    A written statement of the need, in statistical or narrative form, for the proposed project currently and over the following ten (10) year period;

3.    An inventory of known, existing or proposed facilities, by name and address, within King County, or within the region, serving the same or similar needs as the proposed project;

4.    An explanation of the need and suitability for the proposed facility in the proposed City location(s);

5.    Information regarding the number of jurisdictions affected or served by the proposed EPF;

6.    An analysis of the environmental, social, economic, financial and infrastructure impacts of the proposed EPF, including an assessment of the proportionate financial impacts on affected jurisdictions, and consideration of copies of agreements which allocate the financial burdens of the proposed project on the City and other jurisdictions;

7.    An analysis of the proposal’s consistency with the City of SeaTac Comprehensive Plan and development regulations, and plans and policies of other affected jurisdictions, including but not limited to the King County Countywide Planning Policies;

8.    Documentation of public involvement efforts to date, including public and agency comments received, and plans for future public participation;

9.    Such information as requested by staff to complete the preliminary analysis and/or information to assist the Ad Hoc Committee, City staffs and City Council in making the final determination on the CUP-EPF.

E.    CUP-EPF Review Process. All EPFs shall be subject to the following CUP-EPF review procedure:

1.    Project Notification. The applicant, after a preapplication meeting, shall notify the City as soon as possible of intent to submit a CUP-EPF review application. If the applicant does not notify the City of a pending EPF review application, the City may make an initial determination of whether the proposed project is subject to CUP-EPF review, and shall notify the project proponent, in writing, of the City’s determination.

2.    Environmental Review. The EPF project shall comply with all applicable SEPA/NEPA requirements and the proponent shall mitigate identified environmental impacts as conditions of CUP-EPF approval.

3.    Formation of Ad Hoc Committee. The City Council shall establish an Ad Hoc Committee by appointing up to seven (7) members and the Planning Commission appointing one (1) member, for each CUP-EPF application. The Ad Hoc Committee may include representatives of the Planning Commission or other persons with detailed knowledge of City land use or transportation issues. The Ad Hoc Committee shall be appointed by the City Council within seventy-five (75) days of the determination by the Director that the proposed project is an EPF, pursuant to subsection (C) of this section.

a.    The City Council will establish a time frame of not more than sixty (60) days, unless a longer time frame is necessary due to an EPF project timeline, in which the Ad Hoc Committee must review, consult and issue recommended conditions for the EPF. This time frame may be extended only by the authority of the City Council, and shall not be extended more than a maximum of three (3) such time periods, unless the applicant agrees that more time is needed.

b.    Prior to accepting an appointment on the Ad Hoc Committee, an appointee must divulge any vested interest in any properties or businesses, the value of which could be substantially affected by the committee’s recommendations, if any.

4.    Ad Hoc Committee Review and Coordination. The Ad Hoc Committee shall make recommendations to the designated hearing body regarding the appropriate conditions to mitigate the impacts of the proposed EPF under the authority of the City’s SEPA regulations, Comprehensive Plan and development regulations. City staff shall prepare an analysis of the CUP-EPF application for use by the Ad Hoc Committee. The Ad Hoc Committee shall review the staff analysis of the proposed EPF project and prepare written recommendations on each of the following:

a.    Any criteria identified in subsection (F) of this section that was reviewed by the Ad Hoc Committee; and

b.    Whether the project should include a zoning overlay; and

c.    Any recommended conditions for mitigating the impacts of the proposed EPF under the authority of the City’s SEPA ordinances, Comprehensive Plan and development regulations.

The Ad Hoc Committee shall present its draft recommendations to the Planning Commission and, upon receiving input of the Planning Commission, shall prepare final written recommendations to the designated hearing body.

5.    Designated Hearing Body. The Hearing Examiner shall hear an essential public facility application.

a.    Size of project;

b.    Area of City affected by proposed project;

c.    Environmental impact on sensitive areas;

d.    Timing of project.

6.    Staff Report. The Department shall prepare a staff report, which shall include Planning Commission comments, as well as the final recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee. The staff report shall also include an evaluation of the consistency of the proposed EPF, as recommended by the Ad Hoc Committee, with the City’s adopted Comprehensive Plan and development regulations, and shall include proposed findings, proposed conclusions, and proposed recommendations for disposition of the proposed CUP-EPF to the designated hearing body for a public hearing.

7.    Public Hearing and Decision. The designated hearing body shall hold a public hearing pursuant to SMC 16A.13.020, Procedure for Public Hearing, to make findings and issue a decision. The notice of such public hearing shall be consistent with SMC 16A.13.010, Notice of Public Hearing. A final decision shall be rendered by the designated hearing body in accordance with Chapter 16A.15 SMC, Notice of Decision.

F.    Ad Hoc Committee Review Criteria. In making its recommendations the Ad Hoc Committee should consider the following:

1.    Whether the proposed site is adequate in size and shape for the proposed project and the use conforms, or can aesthetically conform, to the general character of the neighborhood.

2.    The proportionate financial burdens of the proposed EPF on the City and other affected jurisdictions, and whether they are reasonably mitigated as provided in an inter-jurisdictional agreement, or by other means.

3.    Whether the proposed EPF is compatible with the following:

a.    Availability and physical constraints of land.

b.    Compatibility with adjacent and nearby land uses.

c.    Mitigation of likely adverse environmental impacts, including but not limited to erosion, sensitive areas, noise, odor, traffic, and air and water quality.

d.    Basic infrastructure standards, such as vehicular traffic, and the availability of necessary utilities and services.

e.    The City of SeaTac’s Comprehensive Plan, development regulations, and SEPA regulations.

f.    Any existing and applicable City inter-jurisdictional agreements.

g.    Siting of secure community transition facilities must be in accordance with the siting criteria of Chapter 71.09 RCW, and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. In addition, no secure community transition facility shall be sited closer than three hundred thirty (330) feet from any residentially zoned property.

G.    Designated Hearing Body Review Criteria. The designated hearing body, giving substantial weight to the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee and the staff report, shall review the application under the following criteria:

1.    Whether the proposed action is consistent with the criteria under subsection (F) of this section;

2.    Whether modifications to recommended conditions or restrictions, if any, are needed to mitigate impacts in a manner which meets the standards of this code and any related development agreement;

3.    Any conditions or restrictions shall be consistent with any development agreements that are in existence at the time of the hearing; and

4.    Whether project conditions cumulatively are reasonable and would not preclude development of the EPF.

Should the recommendation of staff conflict with the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee the recommendation of staff shall be given greater weight.

H.    Development Agreements. The terms and conditions of a development agreement completed after the decision of the designated hearing body shall supersede the conditions and restrictions imposed by the designated hearing body. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.115.050 Zone Reclassification (Rezone)

A.    The purpose of a rezone is to provide a change of zoning to allow a new or different land use which conforms with the City Comprehensive Plan. A rezone may be approved when there has been a change in conditions, and/or is necessary to implement the Comprehensive Plan.

B.    The applicant must show that the proposed development satisfies the following minimum criteria for approval by the Hearing Examiner:

1.    The proposal conforms with the Comprehensive Plan policies and land use map;

2.    The requested reclassification is in the public interest;

3.    The requested reclassification is not hazardous or will not have adverse impacts on adjacent properties;

4.    The requested reclassification does not pose undue burdens on public facilities; and

5.    For sites located within the designated urban center, the requested reclassification has, or will potentially have, an adequate link to a high-capacity transit mode. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.115.055 Preliminary Site Plan

A.    Purpose. Preliminary site plan provides an administrative process by which a development project is reviewed to ensure conformance with applicable policies, codes and development standards. The process is separate from and precedes initial building or engineering permit review and issuance.

B.    Authority and Application.

1.    Projects Which Require SEPA. At a minimum, preliminary site plan review is required for all projects subject to SEPA review per Chapter 16A.23 SMC; provided, that no other land use approval is required. SEPA review shall occur concurrently with the preliminary site plan review process.

2.    Projects Which Do Not Require SEPA. The Director may establish administrative standards for projects to be subject to preliminary site plan review versus those more minor projects which can be approved through standard permit review/issuance.

C.    Approval. Upon the filing of a complete application, the Director or designee shall have the authority, subject to the provisions of this section, to approve, approve with conditions or deny a preliminary site plan application. Approval may be subject to conditions as deemed necessary to ensure conformance with policies, codes and development standards.

D.    Notice of Decision. Upon completion of review of the application, a written notice of decision shall be issued pursuant to Chapter 16A.15 SMC. The date of the decision constitutes the date of approval of the preliminary site plan.

E.    Voiding of Approval. A preliminary site plan approval shall become null and void if a complete application for a building permit, or engineering permit when no building permit is required, is not filed within one (1) year of the date of approval. 

F.    Appeals. The applicant or any party of record may appeal the Director’s decision pursuant to Chapter 16A.17 SMC.

G.    Extensions. Upon written request of the property owner or his/her authorized representative, the Director may grant an extension of time up to but not exceeding six (6) months. Such extension shall be based upon finding that there has been no material change of applicable policies, codes and development standards, and that granting an extension would not be detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare. (Ord. 18-1001 § 3)


15.115.060 Hearing Examiner Development Review Process

A.    See Chapter 1.20 SMC.

B.    Public Hearings.

1.    Before rendering a decision on any application or appeal, the Hearing Examiner shall hold a public hearing thereon. For applications subject to City Council action, the public hearing by the Hearing Examiner shall constitute a hearing by the City Council.

2.    Whenever a project requires more than one (1) permit or approval, the Hearing Examiner may order a consolidation of and conduct the required public hearings to avoid unnecessary costs or delays. Decisions of the Hearing Examiner to order and conduct consolidated hearings shall be final in all cases.

C.    Procedural Notice Requirements. Notice of public hearings shall be provided as specified in Chapter 16A.13 SMC.

D.    Department Report. When an application or appeal has been set for public hearing, the Department shall coordinate and assemble the reviews of other City departments and governmental agencies having an interest in the subject application or appeal, and shall prepare a report summarizing the factors involved and the Department’s findings and recommendation or decision. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the scheduled hearing, the report, and in the case of appeals, any written appeal arguments submitted to the City, shall be filed with the Hearing Examiner and copies thereof shall be mailed to all persons of record who have not previously received said materials.

E.    General Criteria for Examiner Decisions.

1.    Each decision of the Hearing Examiner shall be in writing and shall include findings and conclusions, based on the record, to support the decision.

2.    The Hearing Examiner’s findings and conclusions shall carry out and help implement applicable State laws and regulations and the regulations, policies, objectives and goals of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Code, the Subdivision Code and other official laws, policies and objectives of the City, and that the decision will not be unreasonably incompatible with, or detrimental to, affected properties and the general public.

3.    The Hearing Examiner shall accord substantial weight to the recommendation of the Department.

F.    Examiner Actions. Within ten (10) working days of the conclusion of a hearing or rehearing, the Hearing Examiner shall render a written recommendation or decision and shall transmit a copy thereof to the Department. The Department shall then transmit a copy of the decision to all parties of record.

1.    The Examiner’s decision may be to grant or deny the application or appeal, or the Hearing Examiner may grant the application or appeal with such conditions, modifications and restrictions as he/she finds necessary to make the application or appeal compatible with the environment, and carry out applicable State laws and regulations, and the regulations, policies, objectives and goals of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Code, the Subdivision Code and other ordinances, policies and objectives of the City.

2.    The conditions, modifications and restrictions that the Hearing Examiner may impose include additional setbacks, screening in the form of landscaping or fencing, covenants, easements and dedications of additional road rights-of-way. Performance bonds or equivalent measures may be required to insure compliance with the conditions, modifications and restrictions of this code. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.120.100 Nonconformance – Abatement

A.    Abatement of Illegal Use, Structure, or Development. Any use, structure or other site improvement that cannot be established with a record of compliance with Zoning Code standards in effect at the time of establishment shall be deemed illegal and shall be subject to abatement.

B.    Abatement of Nonconforming Use of Land, Buildings and Structures. The nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures shall be subject to abatement if any of the following circumstances apply:

1.    Any nonconforming use of land involving a building or a structure as defined by this title which building or structure has an assessed value of more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) but less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) on the date of notification shall be completely removed or made to conform within one (1) year from the date of notification as required by subsection (C) of this section, Notice of Abatement or Required Conformance.

2.    Any nonconforming use of a building which cannot be legally established with adequate documentation (King County Tax lot number creation date, tax records of business) shall be required to be removed or made to conform within three (3) years from the date of notification as required by subsection (C) of this section, Notice of Abatement or Required Conformance. 

C.    Notice of Abatement or Required Conformance. When any nonconforming condition exists which is subject to abatement, it shall be the responsibility of the Department to ascertain, with all available means, the approximate date upon which the nonconforming use was established or acquired. Upon determination of legal or illegal nonconforming rights, the Department will follow the following process:

1.    The Department shall notify the owner and lessee of the subject property of the intent to consider the matter and the date of such consideration before the Hearing Examiner.

2.    The Department shall consider all pertinent dates and facts in the written determination and provide the opportunity for the owner or lessee to present such evidence which properly relates to such case. The division shall establish the facts upon which the determination is made to require such property owner to abate or make the use conforming.

3.    The Department shall notify the owner of record and any occupants, in writing, of the staff determination by certified mail and notify all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property boundaries of the determination and the appeal process.

4.    The staff determination shall present a decision by which the use or uses shall be abated or made conforming. Any person in opposition of the decision may appeal that decision to the Hearing Examiner.

5.    The appeal shall be filed no more than ten (10) working days from the date of mailing of the decision. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.120.110 Reuse of Facilities

15.200.030 Zones and Map Designations – Purpose Statements

The purpose statement for each zone and map designation sets forth the type of development within the zones and the general goals of the zone classifications. The purpose also shall guide interpretation and application of land use regulations within the zone classifications, and any changes to the range of permitted uses within each zone through amendments to the code.

A.    Urban Low Density Zone (UL). The purpose of this zone is to create a single-family residential environment that creates high quality housing, diversity and affordability. This is accomplished by requiring appropriate residential uses, requiring open space in conjunction with residential development, providing incentives for affordable housing, and protecting environmentally sensitive sites from over-development. 

B.    Townhouse Zone (T). The purpose of this zone is to create a medium density residential environment that functions as a buffer between adjacent single-family areas and more intensely developed higher density residential or commercial/mixed use areas. This is accomplished by applying design standards that result in a building type that has some single-family characteristics while allowing medium residential densities that will support transit ridership, and allowing some commercial uses in the mixed use context. 

C.    Urban Medium Density Zone (UM). The purpose of this zone is to create a higher density than single-family while maintaining a desirable family environment. This is accomplished by effective clustering and zero lot line planned developments, requiring adequate public facilities and establishing incentives for greater open space, recreational facilities and potential linkage to high capacity transit modes. 

D.    Mobile Home Park Zone (MHP). The purpose of this zone is to provide areas for existing mobile home parks, locate potential sites for relocation purposes, and/or allow the creation of parks which serve citizens while providing sense of ownership and pride. Additionally, this zone will provide appropriate areas for senior citizen parks. 

E.    Urban High Density Zone (UH). The purpose of this zone is to create a high density multi-family housing environment that encourages and, when possible, utilizes high capacity transit modes and allows for a limited amount of small resident-oriented businesses, while ensuring an adequate balance of single-family to multi-family housing in the City of SeaTac. This is accomplished by requiring adequate public facilities and services be in place to support a high density level, encouraging clustering and zero lot line developments with some neighborhood business support, allowing school and church uses, and establishing incentives for greater open space, recreational facilities, and potential linkage to high capacity transit modes. 

1.    Urban High-Urban Center Residential (UH-UCR) Zone. The UH-UCR zone, within the urban center, specifically provides for special urban densities and design standards. 

F.    Neighborhood Business Zone (NB). The purpose of this zone is to provide convenient daily retail and some personal services for a limited service area, and to maintain or enhance the residential area that is served by the businesses. This is accomplished by limiting nonresidential uses to specific needed services, permitting mixed use of multi-family and retail, excluding community/regional business scale uses, and encouraging potential linkages to high capacity transit modes. 

G.    Office/Commercial/Mixed Use Zone (O/C/MU). The purpose of this zone is to create a commercial mixed use medium density designation that is more resident-oriented and less intense than the O/CM zone. This is accomplished by excluding larger scale commercial uses, and requiring that most retail and commercial uses be allowed only in the mixed use context. 

H.    Office/Commercial Medium Zone (O/CM). The purpose of this zone is to create a commercial mixed use medium density designation. This is accomplished by allowing professional offices, a multitude of retailing types, personal services and smaller hotels, restaurants and coffee shops. Developers will be encouraged to mix uses. Mid-rise apartments or mixed residential-commercial or office-residential developments shall also be encouraged in this designation. Structured parking shall be encouraged where feasible. 

I.    Community Business Zone (CB). The purpose of this zone is to provide retail/personal services for a local service area which exceeds the needs of adjacent neighborhood or commercial areas, and to provide retail and personal services on a community oriented basis. This is accomplished by providing for professional offices, a wide range of retail and personal services, sale of commodities, mixed use development, and the potential integration of high capacity transit stations or lines. 

1.    Community Business in the Urban Center (CB-C) Zone. In the CB-C zone, located within the urban center, special design standards apply.

J.    Regional Business Mix (RBX). The purpose of this zone is to provide a higher intensity commercial zone providing areas for the compatible development of heavy commercial uses such as warehouse/distribution, light assembly and service commercial in tandem with people-intensive commercial uses, such as office and related retail uses. It is a transitional zone between industrial areas and less intensive commercial, mixed use or residential zones. The Regional Business Mix zone implements the Comprehensive Plan’s Regional Business Mix land use designation.

K.    Industrial Zone (I). The purpose of the industrial zone is to provide for the location and grouping of industrial enterprises, regional airport, airport related facilities, and activities involving manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, processing, bulk handling, storage, research, warehousing and heavy trucking. These purposes are accomplished by permitting a wide range of industrial uses, establishing appropriate development standards and public review for developments that have potential adverse impacts, and ensuring the location of clean industries.

L.    Park Zone (P). The purpose of this zone is to establish park and open space areas for residential and commercial uses, and to designate areas on hillsides, steep slopes, wetlands, and critical sensitive areas in order to protect them. This purpose is accomplished by providing for outdoor passive and active recreation uses, conservation and protection of municipal watersheds, wildlife corridors and habitats. 

M.    Aviation Commercial (AVC). The purpose of this designation is to create a zone for development that provides support to operations of the airport, the traveling public, and air cargo, and for other development that provides economic benefit to the airport and community while maintaining compatibility with airport operations and activities.

N.    Aviation Operations (AVO). The purpose of this designation is to create a zone for development of the range of facilities that provide for safe and efficient commercial operations and support, together with security, access, the needs and convenience of the traveling public, and handling of air cargo.

15.205.010 Establishment of Uses/Interpretation of Land Use Chart

A.    The use of a property means the purpose or activity for which the building or lot is intended, designed, arranged, occupied or maintained. All applicable requirements of this code, or other applicable State or Federal requirements, shall govern a use located in the City of SeaTac, except within the areas delineated as overlay districts, in which case the land use charts contained within Chapters 15.300 SMC, City Center Overlay District, 15.305 SMC, South 154th Street Station Area Overlay District, and 15.310, Angle Lake Station Area Overlay District, shall apply.

B.    The land use charts in this chapter and other chapters in this code determine whether a specific use is permitted in a zone classification. (Ord. 16-1009 § 9; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.205.020 Classification of Unlisted Uses and Clarification

A.    In creating use charts, the City has considered the characteristics of uses which make them comparable, compatible or similar to each other. The City recognizes that it is not possible to enumerate and classify every use to which land may be devoted, either now or in the future, and that ambiguity may exist with reference to the appropriate and consistent use definition and applicable standards. Therefore:

1.    When any known and identifiable use is not listed as a permissible use in any classification; or

2.    When any use has now come into existence by reason of any technical development in the trades, sciences and equipment; or

3.    When any use already listed in the use charts which, because of any process, equipment or materials used, possesses different performance standards than those which are usually associated with the uses in the classification as presently classified and which, therefore, makes it reasonable that such a use should be placed in the more restrictive classification, it shall be the responsibility and duty of the Department to ascertain all pertinent facts relating to any such use and make what it deems to be the appropriate process on a case-by-case basis for locating the use in the compatible zone classification.

B.    Based on the above situations, the Director shall review the findings of facts and conclusions, and issue a decision of one (1) of the following actions:

1.    Approve or deny the use as a similar and compatible use for that zone classification;

2.    Require approval or denial through the conditional use process; or

3.    Begin the process for review of an amendment to the land use charts.

C.    The purpose of the review shall be to determine that the characteristics of any such use shall not be unreasonably incompatible with the type of uses permitted in surrounding areas, and for the further purpose of determining the need for stipulating such conditions that would mitigate potential impacts and reasonably assure that the basic purpose of this code shall be served.

D.    Any administrative decision issued by the Director can be appealed to the City Hearing Examiner, as stated in SMC 15.115.070, Appeal Process.

E.    On an annual basis, the Director shall review and bring forward any recommended revisions or interpretations for uses to the Planning Commission. Additionally, every five (5) years, the Director shall present a comprehensive review of the code to the Planning Commission for consideration of necessary revisions due to lack of specificity or ambiguity in the adopted standards and their impacts. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.205.030 Use Chart Guide

15.215.005 Purpose

A planned unit development (PUD) has the following purpose: to allow a development which would be as good as or better than that resulting from traditional lot-by-lot development, by permitting flexibility in use of open space and in the design and placement of buildings, circulation facilities, and off-street parking areas in order to best utilize sites characterized by special features of geography, topography, size, or shape. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.010 Initiation of Project – Application

An application for approval of a proposed planned unit development shall be made to the Department using application forms furnished by the City. The application shall be made by the owner(s) of the parcel(s) intended to be developed as a unit, or the owner’s duly authorized agent(s). The ownership of all parcels to be included must join in or be represented in the application. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.015 Procedure for Approval

The procedure to be followed for approval of a PUD shall be composed of two (2) steps:

A.    Review of the development plan by the Hearing Examiner who shall make a recommendation to City Council; and

B.    Review of the recommendation of the Hearing Examiner by City Council. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.020 Phased Development

Development of the project may be phased, in which case each complete phase may be processed as one (1) development. A map showing all property owned or controlled by the developer which is contiguous to the development site, or which is within the area determined by the Director to be relevant for comprehensive planning and environmental assessment purposes, together with a conceptual plan of said properties’ eventual development through all potential phases, shall be submitted with the application for the first phase. The conceptual plan shall conform to the purposes of this chapter and shall be used by the City to review all phases of the development. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.025 Combined Applications 

In all cases:

A.    An applicant may file a concurrent subdivision application, meeting the requirements of the Subdivision Code which shall be processed concurrently with the PUD application.

B.    The applicant may also file a concurrent rezone application, meeting the requirements of SMC 15.115.050, Zone Reclassification (Rezone), which shall be processed concurrently with the other application(s). (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.030 Preliminary Development Plan

A.    Preliminary Development Plan – Filing Requirements. The applicant shall file a preliminary development plan with the Director including, at a minimum, the following information:

1.    A legal description and site location map of the property;

2.    A proposed site plan and/or drawings with five (5) foot contour intervals showing the principal topographic contours; individual trees over eight (8) inches in diameter measured three (3) feet above the base of the trunk in areas to be developed or otherwise disturbed; designated placement, location, and principal dimensions of buildings, streets, parking areas, recreation areas and other open space and landscaping areas; and all property within the area determined by the Director to be relevant for comprehensive planning and environmental assessment purposes; together with a conceptual plan for its development;

3.    Drawing and/or text showing scale, bulk, and architectural character of structures;

4.    Special features;

5.    Text describing conditions or features which cannot be adequately displayed on maps or drawings;

6.    A description of plans for covenants, uses and continuous maintenance provisions for the project;

7.    A conceptual landscape plan;

8.    A circulation diagram indicating the proposed movement of vehicles and pedestrians within the PUD, and to and from existing and programmed thoroughfares; and special engineering features and traffic regulating devices needed to facilitate or ensure the safety of this circulation pattern.

B.    Preliminary Development Plan – Staff Recommendation to the Hearing Examiner. After receiving the preliminary development plan, the Director shall route the same to all appropriate City departments, and each department shall submit to the Director comments and recommendations. After receiving such information from the City departments, the Director shall present recommendations and conclusions before the Hearing Examiner at the public hearing for the preliminary development plan.

C.    Preliminary Development Plan – Hearing. The preliminary development plan will be considered at a public hearing before the Hearing Examiner after notice is given in the manner required by SMC 15.215.260, Notice of Public Hearing.

D.    Preliminary Development Plan – Hearing Examiner Review. The Hearing Examiner shall use the following minimum criteria when making a decision:

1.    The proposed project will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding land use;

2.    Land surrounding the proposed development can be planned in coordination with the proposed development and can be developed so as to be mutually compatible;

3.    Streets and sidewalks, existing and proposed, are in accordance with adopted City development standards to carry anticipated traffic within the proposed project and in the vicinity of the proposed project, in light of the criteria set forth in SMC 15.215.150, Access to Development;

4.    Utility services and other improvements, existing and proposed, are adequate for the development and are to be completed by the estimated completion date of the PUD;

5.    Each phase of the proposed development, as it is planned to be completed, contains the required parking spaces, recreation spaces, landscape and utility areas necessary for creating and sustaining a desirable and stable environment. Such requirements may be reduced through requested permissive variations as outlined in SMC 15.215.170, Permissive Variations in Requirements; provided, that the proposed development sustains a desirable and stable environment;

6.    The project conforms with the basic intent of this code;

7.    The project conforms to the SeaTac Comprehensive Plan, and any applicable area plan that has been adopted by the City pursuant to ordinance or resolution; and

Following the public hearing, the Hearing Examiner may approve the application as proposed, approve with modifications and/or conditions, or deny the application and the accompanying development plan. (Ord. 18-1001 § 7; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.040 Final Development Plan

A.    Final Development Plan – Failure to File, Termination.

1.    In the event the development plan or any required attendant papers are not filed within twelve (12) months for permits in the applicable phases, the approval of the development plan shall lapse, and the approval shall be deemed null and void and without force or effect.

2.    When it is determined as part of the PUD approval that the development plan is to be phased, then the development plan for the first phase must be submitted within twelve (12) months. In no case shall the total phasing of the project exceed five (5) years from the time of the development plan.

3.    The time period for filing of final development plans shall not include periods of time during which progress on the final development plan is reasonably halted or delayed due to the filing and pendency of legal actions challenging an approval granted by the City pursuant to this chapter; provided, that in all cases when more than two (2) years have elapsed subsequent to the date of approval of a preliminary plan, whether due to the pendency of litigation, City-approved extensions of time for filing or otherwise, the permittee shall be required to comply with all current building, construction, subdivision and other applicable standards of the City prior to being granted approval of the final development plan. 

B.    Final Development Plan – Extension of Time for Filing. For good cause shown, the City Council in its discretion, may grant a one (1) year extension of time for filing the final development permits and required accompanying papers.

C.    Final Development Plan – Hearing Examiner Approval. After the public hearing, the Hearing Examiner shall approve or deny the final development plan. The Hearing Examiner shall enter reasons for such action in the records. The Hearing Examiner shall approve the final development plan if determined that it conforms to the standards, including minor changes approved pursuant to SMC 15.215.100, Adjustments – Procedures. For the purpose of this section, “substantially conforms” means that, as compared to the preliminary development plan, the final development plan contains no significant revisions in density, uses, design or development standards in the site plan, and that there is not such a quantity of insignificant revisions that the cumulative effect thereof constitutes, in the Hearing Examiner opinion, a significant revision.

D.    Final Development Plan – Bond Required. No final development plan shall be implemented until the applicant files with the City an approved bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Washington or other equivalent security approved by the City, in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Department’s estimate of the cost of all public improvements, utilities, and all landscaping portions of the final development plan, conditioned upon the permittee’s completion of such portions of the project according to the submitted final development plan and the provisions of this chapter, and, in addition, providing that no change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the project will in any way affect the obligation on bond. Said bond, or an additional bond or other equivalent security, shall also be conditioned upon full restoration of the site in the event that grading, clearing or any other site preparation or work is begun and abandoned, and in the determination of the City, it will better serve the public health, welfare, and safety to restore the site rather than to require completion of public improvements, utilities and landscaping. If the PUD is also being subdivided, the bonds required to be posted by the Department policies/standards, to the extent that they satisfy the requirements of this section, shall be accepted as full or partial fulfillment of the requirements hereof.

E.    Installation of Improvements. In lieu of providing a bond or other suitable security for all required improvements, the applicant may install all such improvements in a manner as approved by the Department.

F.    Final Development Plan – Effect. Approval by the Hearing Examiner of the final development plan for a PUD and filing of the bond for installation of improvements as provided in subsection (D) of this section, Final Development Plan – Bond Required, and subsection (E) of this section, Installation of Improvements, shall authorize the owner(s) of the parcel(s) to be developed as a unit to proceed with the project, acting in concert, and shall bind such owner(s) to the implementation of such final development plan and to the construction and maintenance of the PUD in strict accordance with such approved plan and the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 18-1001 § 8; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

For any residential PUD, as defined in SMC 15.215.140, Location – Uses Permitted, located in more than one (1) zone, the total number of dwelling units allowed may be determined by totaling the number of dwelling units allowed on each portion of the PUD area located in a separate zone according to the regulations of that zone. The number of units arrived at by this method may be located anywhere within the planned unit development, subject to the normal development plan approval process set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.220 Residential Density Incentives

Residential densities in a residential PUD may be increased pursuant to Chapter 15.425 SMC, Development Incentives; provided, that all requirements of this title are met. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.215.230 Site Coverage

For any residential PUD located in more than one (1) zone, the permitted percentage of coverage by buildings and structures may be determined by calculating the percentage of coverage allowed upon each portion of the PUD located in a separate zone, pursuant to the regulation applicable to that zone, and calculating the average of said percentages.

15.300.005 Purpose

A.    The following standards are intended to implement the City’s vision for a City Center/central business district as set forth in the City of SeaTac Comprehensive Plan, by promoting integrated development and pedestrian-oriented design, a diversity of uses within close proximity, a linked series of open spaces, and a focal point for community identity.

B.    Each standard includes examples and illustrations of ways in which the intent of the standard could be achieved. The graphic illustrations are meant to be examples, and not the only acceptable means to accomplishing the intent of the illustrated standards. Applicants and project designers are encouraged to consider designs, styles and techniques not pictured in the examples that fulfill the intent of the design standard. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.300.010 Authority and Application

A.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the City Center Overlay District as delineated in the City Center Overlay District Map at the end of this section. Within the City Center Overlay District, this chapter shall supersede existing regulations elsewhere in SMC Title 15 when in conflict with this chapter.

B.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development meeting one (1) or more of the following thresholds:

1.    All new construction requiring building permits; and/or

2.    Major Redevelopment. Additions or alterations to a building or site, excluding interior-only improvements, which total fifty percent (50%) or more of the gross square footage (GSF) of the existing building(s) or site.

Only the portions of the building or site being altered or added to shall be required to integrate City Center Overlay District standards into the design of the alteration or addition. Project applicants proposing additions or alterations to a building or site conforming to the above criteria for major redevelopment shall arrange a pre-design meeting with planning staff prior to permit application to establish those design standards applicable to the proposed addition or alteration.

C.    Departures. In order to provide flexibility and creativity of project designs, departures from these overlay district standards may be permitted (except to maximum parking requirements in SMC 15.300.410, Off-Street Parking Requirements and Reductions, and SMC 15.300.950, Parking Bonus Incentive Program for Structured Public/Private Parking), subject to the approval of the Director.

1.    If the strict interpretation or application of these special standards would be inconsistent with related provisions of the Zoning Code or would be contrary to the overall purpose or intent of City goals and objectives for the City Center Overlay District or Comprehensive Plan; or

2.    If it can be shown that the overall project design and feasibility can be improved.

D.    Development Agreements. In order to provide flexibility, to permit creativity of design, style, and technique, and to provide for phased development and interim uses, development agreements may be entered into by and between the City and property owners or developers, pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.200; provided, that the terms of any such development agreement shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. Special conditions or exemptions established for a particular site or project through a development agreement shall include criteria or date for the termination of any such agreement.

E.    Single-Family Exemption. Single-family homes are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. In addition, the following zoning designation and related land uses are exempt from the provisions of this chapter: Urban Low (UL).

F.    High Capacity Transit Facilities. Standards for high capacity transit facilities, as identified in Chapter 15.530 SMC, High Capacity Transit Facilities Design Standards, shall apply to all applicable development within the City Center Overlay District.

(Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.300.200 Site Planning and Building Orientation

Purpose: Design structures to have both an external orientation, to the streetscape, and an internal orientation, to the pedestrian environment with unifying open space and pedestrian pathways. Design emphasis should be given to the pedestrian, rather than the auto environment, through placement of parking in a less prominent location (such as underground, or to the rear of the building, rather than in front), the requirement of pedestrian-level retail space; treatment of blank walls and facades and incorporation of prominent architectural features. Site layout should emphasize coordination of open spaces and pedestrian access with adjacent development or public places and compatibility with adjacent development with regard to scale, proximity and landscaping. Lighting and landscaping should allow for safety and visibility of public and semi-public areas. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.300.210 Building Placement/Setbacks

A.    Maximum Front Yard Setback. For City Center Overlay District properties zoned UH-UCR, CB-C, and O/CM, the maximum front yard setbacks shall be as follows, except as provided under SMC 15.300.460(B), Parking Structure Placement and/or Setbacks:

1.    Twenty (20) feet adjacent to International Boulevard, for at least fifty percent (50%) of the building’s front facade;

2.    Ten (10) feet adjacent to all other City Center Overlay District public and/or private streets, as specified in the City Center Plan (see City Center Plan, Figures 5.1 – 5.1b), for at least fifty percent (50%) of the building’s front facade.

B.    Building Orientation. The front facade of the primary building(s) on site shall be oriented toward the front property line, with the main pedestrian entrance(s) located on this front facade. Additional building entrances may be oriented toward the rear or side of the building for access to and from parking lots.

C.    Minimum Building Frontage. At least fifty percent (50%) of the building’s front facade shall be located within the maximum front yard setback, as specified in subsections (A)(1) and (2) of this section. The remaining portions of the front facade may be stepped back a maximum of twenty (20) feet more than the established maximum setback, as approved by the Director, for the purpose of accommodating public open space, porte-cocheres, or recessed building entries.

D.    Building Placement/Setbacks and Open Space. Building placement and setback shall be arranged to accommodate the front yard open space requirement as specified in SMC 15.300.320, Front Yard Open Space.

E.    Setbacks and Landscaping Standards for CB-C Zone. For projects in the CB-C zone, where the side and rear setbacks in the dimensional standards chart in SMC 15.400.100 conflict with the required landscaping in Chapter 15.445 SMC, Landscaping and Tree Retention, the side and rear yard setbacks in the landscaping standards in SMC 15.400.100 shall supersede. This shall not apply where side and rear property lines abut a residential zone.

a.    Transparent glazing incorporated into corner building design;

b.    Tower elements and/or rooflines that accentuate the corner;

c.    Balconies or building terraces at or near the corner.

B.    If the subject property abuts public and/or private streets classified as principal arterials by the SeaTac Comprehensive Plan along both its front and rear property lines, then the property owner shall either:

1.    Design a single building with facade entries oriented toward both the front and rear property lines; or

2.    Orient one (1) or more buildings toward the front property line along with a designated location for a current or future building or buildings oriented toward the rear property line.
[IMAGE]


(Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.300.230 Relation to Adjacent Development

Proposed developments shall coordinate with current site planning and development efforts on adjoining parcels to take advantage of opportunities to mutually improve development design.

A.    Adjacent developments shall link open spaces and landscaping whenever possible.

B.    Proposed developments shall provide publicly accessible pedestrian connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods wherever possible, via a through-block walkway or links to sidewalks. Provide stairs or ramps where necessary when topographic barriers, such as steep slopes, inhibit direct access to surrounding development or destination points, such as transit stops.

C.    Where multi-family residential development is located adjacent to retail, commercial, employment, or institutional uses, side and/or rear yard landscape buffers shall be intersected by approved pedestrian circulation routes in order to facilitate convenient walking connections to adjacent uses or services.

D.    Buildings or structures that terminate view corridors shall include architectural features that increase the visibility and landmark status of the subject building facade, such as a clearly defined building modulation, pedestrian entry feature, and/or roofline that accentuates the building as a focal point.

e.    Color/Material. Coverings with visible corrugated metal or corrugated fiberglass are not permitted. Fabric, plastic and rigid metal awnings are acceptable if they meet applicable standards. 

f.    Variety of Weather Protection. Multitenant retail buildings may use a variety of weather protection features to emphasize individual storefronts and reduce the architectural scale of the building.

g.    Structured Parking. Structured parking entrances that occupy a portion of the front facade are exempt from the weather protection requirement.

3.    Pedestrian Weather Protection and Building Facade Landscaping. Building facade landscaping shall not be required under pedestrian weather protection structures that meet the requirements of subsection (B)(2) of this section. Any facade landscaping that is provided under pedestrian weather protection structures shall be of such width that a minimum five (5) feet of unobstructed walking area remains under the building awning, canopy, overhang, or other weather protection structure. (Ord. 17-1015 § 1)


15.305.620 Pedestrian Building Entries

A.    Primary Building Entries. Primary building entries shall be designed to be clearly visible, safe and accessible from an adjacent public or private street through:

1.    Distinctive Entrance. Incorporate two (2) or more of the following features: 

a.    Distinctive architectural elements such as a variation in the building footprint, roof form, or amount of transparent glazing;

b.    Pedestrian-scaled ornamental lighting no greater than sixteen (16) feet in height;

c.    Landscaping designed as entry focal point.

(Ord. 17-1015 § 1)


15.305.630 Building Facades

A.    Massing.

1.    Arrange the mass of the building taking into consideration the characteristics of the site and the proposed uses of the building. In addition, special situations such as very large sites, unusually shaped sites, or sites with varied topography require particular attention to where and how building massing is arranged, as they can accentuate mass and height.

2.    Reducing Perceived Mass. Use secondary architectural elements to reduce the perceived mass of larger projects. Examples include, but are not limited to, creating recesses or indentations in the building envelope; adding balconies, bay windows, porches, canopies or other elements; and/or highlighting building entries.

B.    Facade Composition. Design all building facades, including visible roofs, considering the composition and architectural expression of the building as a whole. All facades shall be attractive and well proportioned through the placement and detailing of all elements, including bays, fenestration, and materials, and any patterns created by their arrangement.

1.    Building facades shall incorporate vertical and/or horizontal variations in setback, material or fenestration design along the length of the applicable facade, in at least two (2) of the following ways:

a.    Vertical Facade Changes. In order to incorporate architectural variation within a project, a minimum of one (1) vertical facade change shall be provided at least every thirty (30) feet over the length of the applicable facade, with a minimum depth of four (4) feet, such as:

i.    Varying the arrangement, proportioning and/or design of windows and doors;

ii.    Incorporating changes in architectural materials; and/or

iii.    Projecting forward or recessing back portions or elements of the applicable facade. Front facades incorporating a variation in building setback shall include within the setback such architectural elements as covered or recessed building entries, plazas or courtyards, storefront or bay windows, seating and/or planting areas.

b.    Horizontal Facade Changes. In order to differentiate the ground floor from upper floors, a minimum of one (1) horizontal facade change shall be provided, such as:

i.    Stepping back the upper floors from the ground floor building facade;

ii.    Changing materials between the building base and upper floors;

iii.    Including a continuous cornice line between the ground floor and upper floors.

C.     Secondary Architectural Features.

1.    Visual Depth and Interest. Add depth to facades where appropriate by incorporating balconies, canopies, awnings, decks, or other secondary elements into the facade design. Add detailing at the street level in order to create interest for the pedestrian and encourage active street life. Detailing may include features such as distinctive door and window hardware, projecting window sills, ornamental tile or metal, and other high-quality surface materials and finishes.

2.    Dual Purpose Elements. Consider architectural features that can be dual purpose, adding depth, texture, and scale as well as serving other project functions. Examples include shading devices and windows that add rhythm and depth as well as contribute toward energy efficiency and/or savings, or canopies that provide street-level scale and detail, while also offering weather protection. Where these elements are prominent design features, the quality of the materials is critical.

3.    Human Scale. Incorporate architectural features, elements, and details that are of human scale into the building facades, entries, retaining walls, courtyards, and exterior spaces in a manner that is consistent with the overall architectural concept. Pay special attention to the first three floors of the building in order to maximize opportunities to engage the pedestrian and enable an active and vibrant street front.

4.    Texture. Design the character of the building, as expressed in the form, scale and materials, to strive for a fine-grained scale, or “texture,” particularly at the street level and other areas where pedestrians predominate.

Example: Secondary Architectural Features

D.    Treatment of Blank Walls.

1.     Untreated blank walls visible from public streets, sidewalks, or interior pedestrian pathways shall be prohibited.

2.    Definition. The definition of a “blank wall” is any wall or portion of a wall that is visible from a street or pedestrian corridor and is without a ground level window, door or facade opening.

3.    Where blank wall sections are unavoidable due to the requirements of structural needs, they shall not exceed a length of forty (40) feet, or twenty percent (20%) of the length of the facade, whichever is less.

4.    Design Treatments. In order to increase pedestrian comfort and interest, blank wall sections of allowed lengths shall provide two (2) or more of the following special design treatments up to at least the finished ceiling height of the first floor building space:

a.    A minimum of one (1) piece of public art shall be included for every forty (40) feet of enclosed length. Artwork may include, but is not limited to, the following suggestions: 

i.    Artistic wall treatments, such as painted murals, bas-relief murals, trompe l’oeil, photographic montages, or mosaics, on at least fifty percent (50%) of the blank wall surface;

ii.    Neon lighting sculptures or other artistic lighting displays, provided they do not meet the definition of a sign in Chapter 15.600 SMC, Sign Code;

iii.    Provide a decorative masonry pattern, or other architectural feature, over at least fifty percent (50%) of the blank wall surface; and/or

iv.    Employ small setbacks, projections, indentations, or intervals of material change to break up the wall’s surface. (Ord. 17-1015 § 1) 


15.305.640 Rooflines and Equipment

A.    Rooflines. In order to provide a visual terminus to the tops of South 154th Street Station Area Overlay District buildings and soften rectilinear forms, roof designs must conform to one (1) of the following options:

1.    Roofline with Architectural Focal Point. A roofline focal point refers to a prominent rooftop feature such as a peak, tower, gable, dome, barrel vault or roofline trellis structure.

2.    Roofline Variation. The roofline articulated through a variation or step in roof height or detail, such as:

a.    Projecting Cornice. Roofline articulated through a variation or step in cornice height or detail. Cornices must be located at or near the top of the wall or parapet.

b.    Articulated Parapet. Roofline parapets shall incorporate angled, curved or stepped detail elements.

3.    Pitched Roof or Full Mansard. A roof with angled edges, with or without a defined ridge line and extended eaves.

4.    Terraced Roof. A roofline incorporating setbacks for balconies, roof gardens, or patios.

B.    Rooftop Equipment. Building rooftops shall be designed to effectively screen mechanical equipment from street-level view through one (1) or more of the following methods:

1.    A concealing roofline;

2.    A terraced facade;

3.    A screening wall or grillwork directly surrounding the equipment;

4.    Sufficient setback from the facade edge to be concealed from ground level view. (Ord. 17-1015 § 1)


15.305.700 Mixed Use Development Standards

Purpose: Incorporate a mixture of different types of uses in one (1) structure or in close proximity to encourage pedestrian circulation, maximize site development potential and create an active environment. Design ground floors to accommodate commercial uses that benefit from a high degree of pedestrian activity while upper floors are encouraged to be devoted to residential uses.

A.    All new or redevelopment projects located along the primary or secondary pedestrian-oriented streets shall comply with the SMC 15.305.057, Pedestrian-Oriented Uses, Streets and Requirements. (Ord. 17-1015 § 1)


15.305.710 Definition of Mixed Use

“Mixed use” refers to the type of development that blends residential, commercial, cultural or institutional uses, where those uses are vertically or horizontally integrated.

A.    Vertical Mixed Use. Vertical mixed use occurs when different uses inhabit the same building and sit atop one another, such as residential or office uses over ground floor retail or commercial uses.

B.    Horizontal Mixed Use (Attached). A single structure which provides retail/commercial or service use in the portion of a building fronting the public or private street with attached residential uses behind.

C.    Horizontal Mixed Use (Detached). Two (2) or more structures on one (1) site which provide retail/commercial or service uses in the structure(s) fronting the public or private street, and residential uses in separate structure(s) behind or to the side. (Ord. 17-1015 § 1)


15.305.720 Multi-Family Development Standards

Purpose: Design multi-family projects that are of high quality, good architectural design, are compatible with adjacent development, especially single-family neighborhoods, and that provide linked open space.

A.    Multi-family development within the South 154th Street Station Area Overlay District shall meet the requirements of Chapter 15.510 SMC, Multi-Family Housing Design Standards. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 17-1015 § 1)


15.305.800 Additional Standards

15.310.005 Purpose

A.    The following standards are intended to implement the City’s vision for the Angle Lake Station Area as set forth in the City of SeaTac Comprehensive Plan, by promoting transit oriented development and pedestrian-oriented design, a diversity of uses within close proximity, a linked series of open spaces, and a focal point for community identity.

B.    Each standard includes examples and illustrations of ways in which the intent of the standard could be achieved. The graphic illustrations are meant to be examples, and not the only acceptable means to accomplishing the intent of the illustrated standards. Applicants and project designers are encouraged to consider designs, styles and techniques not pictured in the examples that fulfill the intent of the design standard. (Ord. 16-1009 § 1)


15.310.010 Authority and Application

A.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the Angle Lake Station Area Overlay District as delineated on the Official Zoning Map. Within the Angle Lake Station Area Overlay District, this chapter shall supersede existing regulations elsewhere in SMC Title 15 when in conflict with this chapter.

B.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development meeting one (1) or more of the following thresholds:

1.    All new construction requiring building permits; and/or

2.    Major Redevelopment. Additions or alterations to a building or site, excluding interior-only improvements, which total fifty percent (50%) or more of the gross square footage (GSF) of the existing building(s) or site.

Only the portions of the building or site being altered or added to shall be required to integrate Angle Lake Station Area Overlay District standards into the design of the alteration or addition. Project applicants proposing additions or alterations to a building or site conforming to the above criteria for major redevelopment shall arrange a pre-design meeting with planning staff prior to permit application to establish those design standards applicable to the proposed addition or alteration.

C.    Departures. Minor departures from these overlay district standards may be permitted to promote well designed developments which may not strictly comply with the established standards, in order to provide flexibility and creativity of project designs. This process differs from the variance procedure in that rather than being based upon unusual circumstances or physical hardship, it is based upon the quality of the proposed design. A departure shall not be granted for a request that should be made through the variance process in Chapter 15.115 SMC, Land Use Actions and Procedures.

Departures to the maximum and minimum parking requirements and the minimum amount of open space required in SMC 15.310.310, Minimum Open Space Area Required, are not permitted.

The applicant shall submit a Departure Request Application, along with all information listed on that form, including a written response to the criteria in subsections (C)(1) through (3) of this section. A departure is subject to the approval of the Director. 

Any request for departure must satisfy the following:

1.    The request results in a superior design and satisfies the policies of the Angle Lake Station Area Plan;

2.    The strict application of the overlay district standards would be contrary to the Angle Lake Station Area Plan or Comprehensive Plan; or

3.    The departure will not have any substantial detrimental effect on nearby properties, the City or neighborhood.

D.    Development Agreements. In order to provide flexibility, to permit creativity of design, style, and technique, and to provide for phased development and interim uses, Development Agreements may be entered into by and between the City and property owners or developers, pursuant to RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.200; provided, that the terms of any such development agreement shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. Special conditions or exemptions established for a particular site or project through a development agreement shall include criteria or date for the termination of any such agreement.

E.    Exemptions From This Chapter. Single-family homes are exempt from the provisions of this chapter. In addition, the following zoning designation and related land uses are exempt from the provisions of this chapter: Urban Low (UL).

F.    High Capacity Transit Facilities. Standards for high capacity transit facilities, as identified in Chapter 15.530 SMC, High Capacity Transit Facilities Design Standards, shall apply to all applicable development within the Angle Lake Station Area Overlay District.

15.310.100 Circulation

Purpose: Create a station area with an emphasis on the needs of the pedestrian which is also accessible and convenient for vehicles. Sufficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation should be provided through the establishment of an adequate network of streets and sidewalks. Placement of structures, landscaping, circulation patterns and access points should collectively seek to promote an integrated, multi-modal transportation system. Creatively designed, clean and functional pedestrian connections are encouraged to provide access throughout the station area, between properties and to and from the public right-of-way. (Ord. 16-1009 § 1)


15.310.110 Vehicular Circulation Requirements

Vehicular circulation is intended to provide for public access, safe traffic flow, and connections to established vehicular routes.

A.    All new Angle Lake Station Area Overlay District streets shall be constructed in accordance with the City’s adopted street standards specified in SMC Title 11, Streets, Sidewalks, and Public Thoroughfares, and shall generally conform to the adopted Angle Lake District Plan. 

B.    An owner or developer shall coordinate with owners of adjacent parcels and consolidate, wherever possible, vehicular circulation routes to interconnect public and/or private streets in conformance with the adopted Angle Lake District Plan. Where appropriate, circulation corridors shall extend to the boundary line of the site parcel in order to provide for future development of adjacent parcels and connections with existing public and/or private streets.

C.    Dead-end streets shall not be permitted. (Ord. 16-1009 § 1)


15.310.120 Pedestrian Circulation Requirements

Pedestrian requirements are intended to create a network of linkages for pedestrians to improve safety and convenience and enhance the pedestrian environment.

A.    Connected Pedestrian System. On-site pedestrian ways shall be designed to connect to off-site pedestrian way systems on public and/or private streets via a minimum eight (8) foot wide walkway system separated from vehicular traffic. On-site extensions of pedestrian circulation systems shall align with existing pedestrian off-site links.

1.    Sites with Multiple Buildings. All site plans proposing multiple buildings designed for residential occupancy or business access shall connect building entrances to one another and to pedestrian ways on adjacent public and/or private streets.

a.    Public sidewalks may be considered part of the walkway system if they provide convenient movement between structures. 

b.    Fences, landscaping and other site improvements shall be located so as not to impede safe and convenient pedestrian circulation.

B.    Mid-Block Pedestrian Corridors Encouraged. For through lots, the provision of mid-block pedestrian corridors may allow for the departure from certain standards within this chapter. See SMC 15.310.010, Authority and Application, Departures for requirements and criteria.

1.    To be eligible for consideration, the pedestrian corridor shall be as follows:

a.    Width. A minimum of thirteen (13) feet wide with a minimum eight (8) foot pathway of an approved surfacing material. The remaining portion shall be adequately landscaped and approved with a landscape plan. 
[IMAGE]


b.    Amenities. Pedestrian corridors shall be inviting in their overall design, such as through the provision of street furniture, decorative paving, or public art.

c.    Easement Required. Easements for pedestrian corridors shall be open to the public twenty-four (24) hours a day. (Ord. 16-1009 § 1)


15.310.200 Site Planning and Building Orientation

Purpose: Design structures to have an external orientation to the streetscape and the pedestrian environment with unifying open space and pedestrian pathways. Design emphasis should be given to the pedestrians, rather than automobiles, through placement of parking in a less prominent location (such as structured parking, or to the rear of the building, rather than in front); pedestrian-level retail space; treatment of blank walls and facades and incorporation of prominent architectural features. Site layout should emphasize coordination of open spaces and pedestrian access with adjacent development or public places. Lighting and landscaping should allow for safety and visibility of public and semi-public areas.

Sections:

15.315.005    Purpose

15.315.010    Authority and Application

15.315.100    High-Density Single-Family Overlay Zone

15.315.200    Pedestrian-Oriented Commercial Development Overlay Zone

15.315.300    Equestrian Overlay Zone


15.315.005 Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to provide for alternative development standards and to address development opportunities which can exceed the quality of standard developments. This is accomplished by establishing overlay zones (OZ) with alternative standards for special areas designated by the City’s Comprehensive Plan and this code. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.315.010 Authority and Application

Overlay zones shall be combined with underlying zoning for ownerships, or areas containing several properties, to carry out Comprehensive Plan policies and designations, subject to the following provisions:

A.    An overlay zone shall be applied to land only through area zoning adopted in conjunction with the Comprehensive Plan, plan updates, or amendments, with policies and a plan map designation as provided in the Comprehensive Plan. Each application of an overlay zone shall prescribe the purposes and location of the overlay;

B.    An overlay zone shall be indicated on the zoning map with the suffix “OZ” following the map symbol of the underlying zone or zones. The Comprehensive Plan and area zoning shall determine which underlying zones are subject to the overlay, unless a specific underlying zone is required for an overlay zone in this chapter;

C.    The overlay zones set forth in this chapter are the only overlay zones authorized by the code. New or amended overlay zones to carry out new or different goals or policies shall be adopted as part of this chapter and be available for use in the City and meet the goal and policies of the Comprehensive Plan;

D.    The overlay zones set forth in this chapter may waive, modify and substitute for the range of permitted uses and development standards established by the code and for any use or underlying zone; and

E.    Unless they are specifically modified by the provisions of this chapter, the standard requirements of the code and other City ordinances and regulations govern all development and land uses within the overlay zones. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.315.100 High-Density Single-Family Overlay Zone

A.    Purpose. The purpose of the high-density single-family overlay zone is to provide areas of higher density in small pockets of the single-family zone classifications. This will help to encourage infill and allow the development of past platted properties that may have restricted development potential due to the shape or topography of the site.

B.    Development Standards. The following development standards shall apply to residential development locating in the high-density single-family overlay zone:

1.    The lot size shall not be decreased below five thousand (5,000) square feet, not including road easements in the lot calculations; and

2.    Zero lot lines shall be encouraged, and joint open space areas shall be provided with appropriate maintenance covenants for all property owners; and

3.    The development must meet required site-specific SEPA conditions to mitigate project impacts on transportation, utilities, drainage, police and fire protection, schools, parks and environmentally sensitive areas; and

4.    Each overlay zone area shall be linked in some form to a high-capacity transit mode; and

5.    Screening landscaping shall be provided on the boundaries of the sites equal to or greater than the minimum requirements for multi-family dwellings as determined by the Director; and

6.    At least ten percent (10%) of all residential units shall be affordable to low-income households. “Low-income” is an income level below eighty percent (80%) of the median household income for King County, adjusted for household size; and

7.    Housing required by this section shall be affirmatively marketed to racial minorities and handicapped persons; and

8.    A covenant locking in the rent levels for low-income levels for a fifteen (15) year period shall be recorded against the property; and

9.    The project will need to be reviewed through the rezone process (See Chapter 15.115 SMC, Land Use Actions and Procedures); and

h.    Property used for other adult entertainment uses; and

i.    Property used for organizations, associations, facilities and businesses which provide as a substantial portion of their activities, functions or business, the provision of services to children and/or youth, so that the premises of the organization, association, facility or business would have children and youth in attendance or at the location during a predominant portion of the operational hours of the organization, association, facility or business.

2.    The distances provided in this section shall be measured by following a straight line, without regard to intervening buildings, from the nearest point of the property parcel upon which the proposed use is to be located, to the nearest point of the parcel of property or the zone classification boundary line from which the proposed land use is to be separated.

E.    Development Standards. The development standards for sexually oriented businesses are the same as the applicable zoning regulations for the zoning district in which they are to be located, except as follows:

1.    No electronic readerboards shall be allowed;

2.    All parking areas shall be visible from the street fronting the entertainment, and access to the rear of the structure shall be for emergency vehicles only;

3.    The parking areas shall be fully illuminated using street light standards; and

4.    The exterior color of any building or structure, constructed after the effective date of this subsection, shall be of natural and earth tones. A single accent stripe of any color, no greater than one (1) foot in width, may be permitted, if approved by the Director.

The development standards in this section shall apply to all buildings, uses and property used for sexually oriented business/adult entertainment purposes.

F.    Nonconforming Uses – Abatement.

1.    Any sexually oriented business in existence as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, which is in violation hereof, shall be deemed a nonconforming use. Such nonconforming uses shall not in any manner be enlarged, extended, altered or rebuilt except that such uses may be changed to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 

2.    Such uses that are deemed nonconforming pursuant to the terms of this section shall be permitted to continue for nine (9) years following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, unless such use is terminated for any reason whatsoever prior thereto for a period of thirty (30) days or more. Thereafter, such nonconforming use shall terminate or come into compliance with the terms of this chapter. It is provided, however, that, notwithstanding the term of the lease, upon the expiration of any lease for a nonconforming sexually oriented business use, the sexually oriented business use shall no longer be permitted to continue at the same location thereafter. It is further provided that after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, leases for nonconforming sexually oriented business uses shall not be extended or amended in any way that delays the expiration of the term of the lease.

G.    Variance from Locational Requirements.

1.    Whenever the proponents of a sexually oriented business subject to the locational requirements set forth in this chapter feel that the strict application of such requirements is not necessary to achieve an effective degree of physical separation between the sexually oriented business and noted uses in subsection (D)(1) of this section, the proponent(s) may apply to the Hearing Examiner for a variance from such requirements.

2.    In determining when a variance should be granted, and if so, to what extent, the Hearing Examiner shall consider the following, in addition to the general criteria for a variance established in Chapter 15.115 SMC, Land Use Actions and Procedures:

a.    Topographic and other features of the land which provide actual separation between the proposed business or other land use and surrounding land uses;

b.    Pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns in the vicinity of the proposed activity; and

c.    Any other fact or circumstance which has a significant effect upon the need for the full separation distance required by this chapter.

3.    If, after considering these criteria, the Hearing Examiner finds that an effective separation between the proposed adult entertainment use and the residential zone classification or other stated uses can be achieved without requiring the full distance of separation provided by this chapter, the Hearing Examiner shall determine the degree of variance to be allowed and shall grant such variance. Otherwise, the application for the variance shall be denied. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.445.005 Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to foster retention of significant trees and to provide landscaping in developments to preserve and enhance the aesthetic character of the City, to improve the quality of the built environment, to promote retention and conservation of existing natural vegetation, to reduce the impacts of development on drainage systems and natural habitats, and to increase compatibility between different land uses by:

A.    Providing visual interruption of large expanses of parking areas and reduction of reflected heat and glare through the implementation of interior and perimeter parking area landscaping;

B.    Screening undesirable views from surrounding properties;

C.    Providing a visual and physical barrier between dissimilar adjoining land uses;

D.    Providing increased areas of permeable surfaces which allow:

1.    Infiltration of surface water into groundwater resources;

2.    Reduction in the quantity of storm water discharge; and

3.    Improvement in the quality of storm water discharge.

The landscaping standards in this chapter are minimum requirements. Where it is determined by the City that additional landscaping is needed to mitigate, screen or buffer the development from its surroundings, or comply with the spirit of this chapter, additional landscaping may be required. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.445.010 Authority and Application 

A.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to: 

1.    All new developments on vacant land requiring building permits; or

2.    When the gross floor area (gfa) of a building/complex expands beyond twenty percent (20%) of the total existing gfa, the current landscape standards shall be applicable and integrated into the redevelopment. Within the Neighborhood Business (NB) zone, the provisions of this chapter shall apply when the complex expands beyond forty percent (40%) of the total existing gfa; or

3.    Upon the change in use of any property to public/private parking; or

4.    Upon the conversion of any outdoor space of two hundred (200) square feet or greater to a business use or parking, the current landscape standards shall be integrated into that portion of the site to the greatest extent feasible.

B.    Exemptions. The following uses are exempt from the landscaping requirements of this chapter (SMC 15.445.100 through 15.445.300):

1.    Single-family dwellings;

2.    Residential accessory uses; and

3.    Subdivisions (except as provided under SMC 15.445.260) and short subdivisions in regard to perimeter and street landscape proportions only.

C.    Landscaping Requirements and Increased Setbacks. Where the width of a required landscape strip exceeds the normally required setback of a zone or specific use, the required setback shall be increased to accommodate the full width of the required landscaping.

1.    Exceptions.

a.    UH-UCR, CB-C and O/CM Zones Outside of Overlay Districts. The street frontage landscape strip requirement shall not apply to uses in the Urban High-Urban Center Residential (UH-UCR) zoning category, Community Business in the Urban Center (CB-C) zoning category, or Office/Commercial Medium (O/CM) zoning category outside of the overlay districts. Alternative street frontage landscaping requirements are located in SMC 15.515.200(C)(1).

b.    City Center, South 154th Street and Angle Lake Station Area Overlay Districts. Within the designated City Center, South 154th Street Station Area, and Angle Lake Station overlay districts, front yard open space as per SMC 15.300.320, 15.305.320 and 15.310.300 shall be required in lieu of street frontage landscaping required within this chapter.

2.    Relocation of Required Street Frontage Landscaping. If the normal required landscaping is reduced through this exception for all applicable zones except in the designated overlay districts, fifty percent (50%) of said landscaping shall be placed into plazas, rooftop gardens and other pedestrian amenities, and street trees shall be planted within the public right-of-way in locations and amounts to be determined by the Director.

D.    Landscaping and Existing Buildings. When an existing building precludes installation of the total width of required landscaping, the landscaping shall be installed to the extent possible and the remaining required landscaping shall be installed elsewhere on the site to provide the best possible screening. 

E.    Other Standards Applicable. Except as specified in this section of the Zoning Code, all other relevant standards and requirements in this code shall apply. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 16-1022 § 1 (Exh. C); Ord. 16-1009 § 13; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.445.015 Departures

Upon review and approval by the Director, departures to the landscape standards required under this chapter may be allowed to provide additional visibility of a development proposal to implement the Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) standards under Chapter 17.56 SMC, Landscaping. At a minimum, the following criteria shall be used to determine if a departure is warranted.

A.    Physical site conditions dictate a project layout that, with landscaping installed pursuant to this chapter, would provide potential areas of concealment for criminal elements.

B.    Required landscaping will provide potential concealment areas for criminal activities.

C.    Screening of dissimilar land uses (for example, commercial/industrial land uses from residential) is not diminished to the point that the screening landscaping no longer meets the intent of the landscape codes. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

(Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 16-1009 § 4; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)




15.445.220 Street Frontage Landscaping

A.    On-site street frontage landscaping shall be installed on the subject (private) property and is separate from street landscaping as described in SMC Title 11, Streets, Sidewalks, and Public Thoroughfares.

B.    Combining Street Frontage and Street Landscaping in Right-of-Way. On-site street frontage landscaping required under SMC 15.445.210 and right-of-way (ROW) street landscaping required under SMC Title 11 may be combined upon review and approval by the Director. 

1.    The combined landscaping may be variable widths, no less than five (5) feet; provided the total required amount of the combined on-site street frontage landscaping and ROW street landscaping is located on site outside of the public ROW. (For example, if the combined required on-site street frontage landscaping and ROW street landscaping is twenty (20) feet in width along a one hundred (100) foot street frontage (fifteen (15) feet on site, five (5) feet in the ROW), and the width is reduced to seven (7) feet on site, then one thousand three hundred (1,300) square feet of landscaping (13 feet x 100 feet = 1,300 square feet) must be distributed elsewhere on site, outside of the ROW, in addition to other on-site landscape requirements.) 

2.    Variable widths may be allowed based on the following criteria:

a.    The location of below and above ground utilities.

b.    To provide bike lanes, if sufficient right-of-way is not available to provide both the bike lane and street landscaping.

c.    Traffic safety.

d.    Topographic conditions.

e.    Other special site conditions.

C.    Reducing Width of Street Frontage Landscaping. The width of the street frontage landscaping may be reduced twenty-five percent (25%) if the area comprising the twenty-five percent (25%) is allocated to landscaping located adjacent to the street facing facade of the building(s) on a site. The landscaping shall be placed in a manner and consist of vegetation determined by the Director to provide equal or greater screening from the street. The twenty-five percent (25%) allocation is in addition to the required building facade landscaping. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.445.230 Building Facade Landscaping

A.    Groundcover shall be spaced a maximum of two (2) feet along building facades.

B.    Conifers shall not be used for facade landscaping.

C.    Deciduous trees can be placed at thirty (30) foot centers for facade landscaping on buildings with continuous windows. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.445.240 Side/Rear Buffer Landscaping for Noncompatible Uses

Side and rear landscape buffers shall be required where noncompatible uses develop adjacent to residentially zoned property pursuant to the landscaping standards charts for recreation, accessory, recreational/cultural uses, general, educational and health services uses, government/office uses, retail commercial uses, and manufacturing uses at SMC 15.445.210, except as modified below: 

A.    Where noncompatible uses develop adjacent to property that is zoned residential but which has a nonresidential or high density residential potential zone compatible with the proposed development, then the buffers of the said SMC 15.445.210 charts may be reduced to ten (10) feet of Type I landscaping. This shall not, however, apply to any phasing areas as identified in the SeaTac Comprehensive Plan “Land Use Phasing Map.”

B.    For the purposes of this section, hotel/motel and associated uses shall be considered a commercial use, and mobile/manufactured home parks shall be considered a single-family residential use. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.445.250 Surface Parking Landscaping

A.    At least ten percent (10%) of the interior parking area shall have landscaping when the total number exceeds twenty (20) parking stalls. 

B.    Landscape Islands. At least one (1) interior landscape island for every seven (7) parking stalls shall be provided to be reasonably distributed throughout the parking lot. Landscape island siting and design may be adjusted to accommodate LID BMPs, such as bioretention.

C.    Trees and Landscape Islands. At least one (1) tree must be provided in each landscape island.

D.    Curbs/Barriers. Permanent curbs and/or barriers shall be provided to protect the plantings from vehicle overhang. Curb cuts or grates can be incorporated to allow water to enter stormwater facilities and LID BMPs.

E.    The perimeter of a parking lot shall be planted with a minimum of five (5) foot landscaping buffers with Type III landscaping. Any abutting landscaped areas can be credited toward meeting this standard. 

F.    Height of Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping in areas adjacent to a parking space shall not exceed two (2) feet in height within three (3) feet of the curb, to allow for car overhangs.

A.    All new uses locating in any new building shall be required to meet the off-street parking, internal circulation, loading space, bicycle parking and storage, and pedestrian circulation requirements of this chapter.

B.    Any use that requires an addition to an existing building or a change of use encompassing more than forty percent (40%) of the gross floor area (gfa) of the building/complex shall require the current parking standards be implemented relative to only the new square footage.

C.    If this chapter does not specify a parking requirement for a specific land use, the Director shall establish the minimum requirement based on a comparable parking demand. The applicant may be required to provide a parking study for the proposed use demonstrating that the parking demand for the specific land use will be satisfied. The study shall be prepared by a professional with expertise in traffic and parking analysis, or an equally qualified individual authorized by the Director.

D.    If the required amount of off-street parking has been proposed to be provided off-site, the applicant shall provide a satisfactory written contract with cooperating landowners showing the provision of adequate off-street parking. Additionally, satellite parking is permitted for accessory uses in conjunction with primary uses in SMC 15.455.150, Location of Parking.

H.    Mobile Home Park Relocation Standards. At such time as the owner of a mobile home park determines to close a mobile home park, or any portion thereof, or to change the use of the land on which a mobile home park is located, or any portion thereof, including conversion to a mobile home park subdivision, condominium or cooperative as discussed below, but prior to the date on which the owner gives notice to tenants of the change of land use pursuant to RCW 59.20.080(1)(e), the owner shall submit to the City a mobile home park relocation plan covering the park or portion of the park for which a change is proposed.

In the case of conversion to a mobile home park subdivision, condominium or cooperative, a relocation plan shall be required if and only if purchase of a share is necessary to remain in the park; in such cases, the relocation plan shall be required only for tenants who are not purchasing a share and would be displaced by the conversion. Once the plan is approved in accordance with this section, the City shall issue a certificate of approval to the mobile home park owner. The mobile home relocation plan shall comply with the standards and procedures contained in this section.

If an eminent domain action of a Federal, State or local agency causes closure of a mobile home park and the procedures set forth in the Federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, 42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq., and the regulations of 49 CFR Part 24 or the Relocation Assistance – Real Property Acquisition Policy Act of Chapter 8.26 RCW and the regulations of Chapter 468-100 WAC are followed, the requirements of those acts and regulations will supersede the requirements of this section and the standards contained herein.

If a condemnation action of the City causes closure of a mobile home park, the City will be responsible for fulfilling the requirements of the standards contained herein and may provide additional relocation assistance in accordance with the provisions of the State act and regulations. If the City chooses to follow portions of the State act and the Director determines that there is a conflict or redundancy between the portions of the State act and regulations being followed by the City, and the standards contained herein, the State act shall take precedence in such areas of conflict or redundancy. If the State act is followed in all respects, such act will supersede the requirements of this section and the standards contained herein.

1.    Required Elements of the Mobile Home Park Relocation Plan. The mobile home relocation plan shall include the following required elements:

a.    Inventory. An inventory of park tenants and their mobile homes shall be prepared in a format established by the Department (hereinafter referred to as the “department”). The purpose of the inventory is to provide data for the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW) checklist (hereinafter referred to as the “SEPA checklist”), which will analyze the impact of the park closure, and to establish a basis for identifying relocation/mitigation options. The inventory shall include:

i.    An inventory of park tenants (to include information as to age, income, number of years in the park);

ii.    An inventory of the age and conditions of the mobile homes; and

iii.    Costs of pad rental, park utility fees and other charges, personal utilities, insurance, personal property taxes, and mobile home security interests, if applicable.

The inventory request form shall clearly state to tenants that disclosure of age, income and housing cost information is voluntary, and that the purpose of requesting the information is to assess the impact of the proposed closure and the applicability of low-income housing assistance programs. If provided, this information shall be treated in a confidential manner and shall be made public only in statistical summary format.

b.    Environmental Conditions. An analysis of environmental conditions in the park shall be conducted. The analysis shall include noise levels and other environmental factors affecting the suitability of the park for various land uses, including mobile homes, other residential uses, and commercial uses. This information will be used to prepare the SEPA determination of environmental impacts of the proposed action. Noise measurements shall be taken on site by the property owner using an approved noise meter.

c.    Options. A list of relocation options shall be prepared, including: 

i.    A list of vacant mobile home park spaces in King and Pierce Counties, together with a description of each park’s amenities, restrictions, rental rates and other costs charged;

ii.    A list of low cost apartments or other low cost housing options in King County;

iii.    Information from banks concerning first-time home buyer programs; 

iv.    Information from the county or nonprofit entities concerning relocation park options; and

v.    Information from the Port of Seattle regarding the process for obtaining Port noise mitigation funds and “advisory assistance,” if applicable, including a statement of whether or not the owner intends to participate in any available program and pass noise mitigation funds to tenants.

d.    Choices. A statement of housing preference, based on the available options, shall be gathered from each mobile home tenant. The list of each participating tenant’s preference shall provide a basis for tenants to coordinate their preferences with others in the park and with the available opportunities.

e.    Anticipated Timing. The mobile home park owner shall provide a statement of anticipated timing for park closure.

f.    Coordination Plans or Actions. The mobile home park owner shall provide a statement of any coordination plans or actions in addition to those stated above that the park owner intends to take in order to minimize the impacts of park closure on the tenants. The relocation plan shall identify an official relocation plan contact. The contact shall be responsible for providing the required relocation information to tenants and status information to the City.

2.    Required Process. The timing and preparation of the mobile home relocation plan shall comply with the following process:

a.    The owner of the park shall initiate a preapplication meeting with the department to clarify the requirements of the relocation plan. If applicable, the applicant shall also meet with Port of Seattle staff to determine if relocation assistance is available.

b.    The owner of the park shall notify, in writing, all affected park tenants and the department that the owner is beginning the process of preparing a mobile home relocation plan. In such notification, the department shall schedule a meeting with tenants to inform them of the owner’s proposal for the property, the requirements of the mobile home relocation standards, as contained herein, and the proposed timeline for the process.

c.    The mobile home park owner shall prepare a relocation plan, pursuant to the requirements of subsection (H)(1) of this section.

d.    The mobile home park owner shall complete a SEPA checklist for the relocation plan. A copy of the SEPA checklist shall be sent to each tenant of the mobile home park. If the owner is proposing to redevelop the site, the owner may choose to have the site plan for the new development evaluated for environmental impacts concurrently with the relocation plan. If this option is chosen, the owner shall submit a site plan along with the SEPA checklist and relocation plan.

e.    The department shall review the relocation plan to ensure compliance with the requirements of subsection (H)(1) of this section. If it is determined that the requirements have not been met, the department shall notify the mobile home park owner in writing of the identified deficiencies. The owner shall revise the plan to correct all of the identified deficiencies before resubmitting it to the City.

f.    Once it is determined that the requirements of subsection (A) of this section have been met, the Director of the department shall issue a decision on the relocation plan based on the impacts of the proposed action. The decision may be to approve, deny, or require modification of the relocation plan. If the relocation plan is approved, the Director shall issue a certificate of approval.

g.    The decision of the Director is appealable to the Hearing Examiner, in accordance with the procedures of SMC 15.115.070, Appeal Process. If the decision is appealed, the relocation plan process as set forth herein shall automatically be stayed until the appeal is resolved.

h.    If approved, the relocation plan shall be delivered to all tenants by the mobile home park owner prior to or coincident with the minimum twelve (12) month notice of intent to close the park. The relocation plan shall be valid for delivery to tenants for three (3) months from the date of approval. If the relocation plan is not delivered in this time frame, or if park closure does not occur within two (2) years of approval of the plan, preparation of a new or updated plan may be required by the City.

i.    The mobile home park owner shall provide to the City a statement confirming that all requirements of Chapter 59.23 RCW, if applicable, including notice and first right of refusal of tenants to purchase the park have been followed.

j.    The park owner shall submit to the City a report on the relocation process which shall include: (a) a list of tenants remaining in the park, by space or address (rent roll); and (b) spaces which have been vacated together with a description of the destination of vacating tenants and the type of housing obtained. The report shall be submitted monthly, or more frequently if requested by the department, until the park is vacant.

k.    Once the relocation plan has been deemed by the Director to be satisfactorily implemented, the City shall issue a certificate of satisfactory completion. The mobile home park shall not be closed prior to the issuance of said certificate. The relocation plan shall be deemed to be satisfactorily implemented when the plan’s stated actions have been implemented and when all tenants have relocated.

3.    Alternative Plan and Process. If the owner of a mobile home park negotiates a relocation agreement with tenants to the satisfaction of such tenants, the agreement, signed by all affected tenants, shall be submitted to the City in lieu of the relocation plan and process of subsections (H)(1) and (2) of this section. The following process shall then apply:

a.    The City Attorney shall review the agreement and attest to its legality as to form.

b.    The requirement of RCW 59.20.080(1)(e) with respect to a twelve (12) month notice of land use change must still be met. However, if all tenants have satisfactorily relocated prior to the statutory twelve (12) month period, the park, or portion thereof, may be closed sooner.

c.    Once the agreement has been determined to address the needs of the tenants, the Director shall issue a certificate of approval.

d.    The owner shall submit monthly reports in accordance with subsection (H)(2)(j) of this section.

e.    After all tenants have moved from the park, the Director shall issue a certificate of satisfactory completion and the park may be closed. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.480.005 Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to establish local guidelines, standards and procedures for the siting and construction of wireless communications facilities (WCFs), and to address the issues of appearance and safety associated with WCFs. It is intended to provide adequate siting opportunities at appropriate locations within the City to support existing WCF technologies, to encourage new technologies to benefit SeaTac residents, businesses, and institutions, and to permit WCF providers to remain competitive. This chapter has been developed in conjunction with a Wireless Telecommunications Master Plan that forecasts future needs for wireless facilities in SeaTac and analyzes appropriate locations for their placement.

A wide range of locations and options that minimize the safety hazards and visual impacts sometimes associated with WCFs are provided. The siting of facilities is encouraged on buildings and structures, and in certain rights-of-way as locations for wireless communications infrastructure to establish a precedence of quality concealment products that will minimize the aesthetic impact of related infrastructure. The siting of concealed facilities on existing structures, collocation of WCFs, and visual mitigation measures are encouraged in this chapter in order to preserve neighborhood aesthetics and reduce visual clutter in the community.

The development standards in this chapter establish siting criteria and address setbacks, landscaping, dimensions, and other site-specific design requirements. Siting criteria for WCFs are necessary to encourage the siting of those facilities in locations most appropriate based on land use compatibility, neighborhood characteristics, and aesthetic considerations. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.505.005 Purpose

Townhouses and duplexes offer several advantages over single-family detached houses: lower costs for land development, conservation of the land by using less land for a given number of houses and preserving open space, lower long-term maintenance costs, energy efficiency, and increased security for both the house and the neighborhood.


[IMAGE]


Example: Example of well designed townhouses.

The following design standards are intended to implement the City’s vision for housing as set forth in the City of SeaTac Comprehensive Plan. The standards serve three (3) basic purposes: to promote quality development; to increase neighborhood compatibility; and to enhance security.

A.    Quality Design. A quality development is one that is functional and pleasant for its residents as well as the public. Such a development starts with an investment in quality materials that will not rapidly decay, and design that ensures ample privacy as well as amenities for residents. Well-designed environments will provide places for residents to meet and visit, open spaces located to take advantage of sunny exposures, and safe places for children to play. A high quality development will also contribute to an attractive streetscape by providing buildings with architectural detailing, entries that present themselves with an air of pride, and landscaping that adds color, texture and comfort to a neighborhood.

B.    Neighborhood Compatibility. Good design also ensures neighborhood compatibility by appropriate scale and massing adjacent to existing housing. Landscaping and the careful placement of windows and balconies for privacy help to create a pleasant environment.

C.    Enhanced Security. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is a concept that employs site and building design as a crime prevention strategy intended to reduce the opportunity for criminal behavior, reduce the incidence and fear of crime, reduce calls for police service, and improve the quality of life. It includes four (4) principles:

1.    Natural Surveillance. The arrangement of space and buildings that enables residents to observe their surroundings. Natural surveillance increases safety by allowing residents to see trespassers. Making a potential offender feel that they will be seen and reported discourages criminal behavior. See Figure: NATURAL SURVEILLANCE.


[IMAGE]


Figure: NATURAL SURVEILLANCE. Windows and balconies overlooking a street contribute to an active and safe streetscape.

2.    Natural Access Control. The placement of walkways, building entrances, fences, landscaping, and lighting to discourage access to crime targets and create the perception of risk to offenders. Natural access control enhances safety through design, which reduces or supplements the use of more costly access control such as security guards and mechanical devices.

3.    Territorial Reinforcement. Extending the sense of ownership from the private residence to the nearby areas outside the dwelling through physical improvements such as fencing, pavement, landscaping and lighting. Clearly defined territory deters entrance by those with criminal intent and makes their actions more visible and likely to be reported by those who recognize the territory as their own.

4.    Maintenance. Ensuring that buildings and grounds are maintained for resident safety, neighborhood aesthetics, and to reflect building management. Maintenance serves as an expression of ownership and allows for continued use of the space for its intended purpose. Maintenance prevents a reduction of visibility from landscaping and obstructed or inoperative lighting. A clean and well-maintained site tells offenders that residents care about their surroundings and criminal behavior will not be tolerated.

Townhouse and duplex developments subject to the design standards in this chapter are envisioned to create developments that are good places to live. These developments will respond better to existing communities and contribute positively to the emergent urban center of the City of SeaTac. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.505.010 Authority and Application

A.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all townhouse and duplex developments throughout the City. These standards shall supersede existing regulations elsewhere in SMC Title 15 when in conflict with this chapter.

B.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development meeting one (1) or more of the following thresholds:

1.    All new construction requiring building permits; and/or

2.    Major Redevelopment. Additions or alterations to a building, excluding interior-only improvements, which total twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the gross square footage (GSF) of the existing building(s) or site.

Only the portions of the building or site being altered or added to shall be required to integrate townhouse and duplex design standards into the design of the alteration or addition. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.505.020 Departures

In order to provide flexibility and creativity of project designs, departures from these design standards may be permitted, subject to the approval of the Director, providing:

A.    The strict interpretation or application of these Design Standards would be inconsistent with related provisions of the Zoning Code or would be contrary to the overall goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan; or

B.    The departure creates a project design that meets or exceeds the overall purpose and intent of the design standards. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.505.100 Dimensional Standards

Intent: Height, setback, and massing standards promote development that fits well architecturally near existing single-family houses, while allowing densities that promote transit use, shared open space amenities, and a pedestrian orientation in a vibrant urban environment. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.505.200 Site Design

Purpose: Design townhouse and duplex sites to have both an external orientation to the streetscape, and an internal orientation to the residential environment with unifying open space and pedestrian pathways. Design emphasis should be given to the pedestrian, rather than the auto environment through placement of parking in a less prominent location (such as underground, or to the rear of the building, rather than in front). Site layout should observe principles of “natural surveillance,” “natural access control” and “territorial reinforcement” by arranging circulation systems, parking areas, sidewalks, and open space to give the perception of being a residential and controlled space in which illegal activity will be observed and reported. Lighting and landscaping should allow for safety and visibility of public and semi-public areas. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.505.210 Site Configuration

Intent: Locate townhouse and duplex structures to create a “street wall” which enhances the streetscape and the overall pedestrian experience.

A.    A minimum of three (3) connected dwellings shall be oriented to each street adjacent to the development. Duplexes shall only be permitted in the interior of a lot. See Figure: SITE CONFIGURATION.


[IMAGE]


Figure: SITE CONFIGURATION Isometric and plan views illustrating the required number of units fronting on a street. 

B.    Developments shall use one (1) of the following site configurations:

1.    Alley-loaded. A development with a single row of dwellings that front on a street and are served by an alley in the rear. See Figure: ALLEY-LOADED AND AUTO COURTS.

2.    Auto Court. A development with two (2) rows of dwellings grouped around an auto court. One (1) row fronts on the street, the other on the auto court. See Figure: ALLEY-LOADED AND AUTO COURTS. 
[IMAGE]

(Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.505.230 Pedestrian Access and Circulation

Intent: Enhance pedestrian safety and convenience by providing an integrated pedestrian circulation system throughout the development. Contact points between pedestrians and vehicular paths should be minimized; where necessary they should be designed to alert drivers to crossing pedestrians.

A.    All developments shall feature a fully integrated pedestrian circulation system that connects buildings, open space, and parking areas with the adjacent street sidewalk system.

B.    Pedestrian circulation shall consist of sidewalks or designated pathways, raised or otherwise separated from parking and vehicular circulation. An exception to this is an auto court, which is designed for shared pedestrian and auto use. 

C.    Sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width, clear of any vehicle overhangs.

D.    Clear pedestrian paths separate from parking areas shall connect main entries of townhouse units facing the street directly to sidewalks.

E.    Pedestrian paths shall be visible from buildings or parking areas, and shall be designed to avoid creating “dead ends” or isolated areas. 

F.    Design standards for sidewalks can be found in SMC Title 11.

G.    Pedestrian paths shall be illuminated pursuant to Chapter 17.40 SMC, Walkway, Bikeway and Park Lighting. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.505.240 Vehicular Access, Circulation and Auto Courts

Intent: Provide adequate capacity for motor vehicles while reducing their impact on the built environment by relegating parking to the rear of buildings.

A.    Vehicular access to individual townhouses and duplexes shall be via a rear alley or auto court separate from the street. 

B.    The creation of dead end streets shall be permitted only where there is no feasible connection with an adjacent street.

C.    Developments with private streets, alleys, and auto courts shall be required to allow for additional access by adjacent properties when the Director determines that adjacent properties may be developed in the future and that it would be in the public interest to provide a joint access easement. A covenant shall be placed on the subject property(ies) allowing use of the access easement.

D.    Design standards for streets and alleys can be found in SMC Title 11.

E.    Auto Courts.

15.510.005 Purpose

The following design standards are intended to implement the City’s vision for high quality multi-family development as set forth in the City of SeaTac Comprehensive Plan. The standards serve three (3) main purposes: to promote quality building and site design, to enhance the streetscape and to ensure compatibility with neighboring communities.

A.    Quality Building and Site Design. A quality development is functional, safe and pleasant for its residents as well as the public. Well-designed environments will orient outward to the community, provide high quality architecture and create comfortable and attractive places for residents to meet, visit and live.

B.    Enhanced Streetscape. A high quality development contributes to an attractive streetscape by connecting to the community and providing buildings with architectural detailing, welcoming and easily identifiable entries, and landscaping that adds color, texture and comfort to a neighborhood.

C.    Neighborhood Compatibility. Good design ensures neighborhood compatibility by appropriate scale and massing adjacent to existing housing. Landscaping and the careful placement of windows and balconies for privacy help to create a pleasant environment. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.510.010 Authority and Application

A.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all multi-family development of three (3) units or more throughout the City. These standards shall supersede existing regulations elsewhere in this title when in conflict with this chapter, except as provided in SMC 15.510.700, Multi-Family and Mixed Use Projects in the Overlay Districts and CB-C, UH-UCR and O/CM Zones.

B.    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development meeting one (1) or more of the following thresholds:

1.    All new construction requiring building permits; and/or

2.    Major Redevelopment. 

a.    Additions or alterations to a building, excluding interior-only improvements, which total fifty percent (50%) or more of the gross square footage (GSF) of the existing building(s), except for the South 154th Street Station Area.

b.    Major Redevelopment in the South 154th Street Station Area. Additions or alterations to a building, excluding interior-only improvements, which total twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the gross square footage (GSF) of the existing building(s).

c.    Only the portions of the building being altered or added to shall be required to integrate multi-family design standards into the design of the alteration or addition.

C.    Departures. Departures from these standards may be allowed, to promote well-designed developments which may not strictly comply with the established standards. Proposed departures from these special standards are subject to the approval of the Director.

1.    Not Applicable. A departure shall not be granted for height, setbacks, building lot coverage, maximum and minimum parking requirements, minimum lot area, density, lot width or land uses.

2.    Departure Criteria. The applicant must show that the proposed development requesting a departure(s) meets all of the following criteria:

a.    The requested departure meets the intent of the applicable design standard.

b.    The requested departure will not have a detrimental effect on adjacent and nearby properties.

c.    The requested departure offers a significant improvement over what otherwise could have been built under the minimum design standards.

d.    The requested departure is part of an overall, thoughtful and comprehensive approach to the design of the project as a whole. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.510.050 Density Calculation

Intent: Ensure appropriate densities on properties with environmentally critical areas.

A.    The maximum allowable density for a property shall be calculated as follows:

	Net Site Area / Minimum Lot Size = Maximum # of Allowed Units

B.    For the purposes of this section, the net site area is the total site area minus any areas that are classified as one (1) of the following critical areas:

1.    Class I, II or III wetlands;

2.    Class I, II or III streams;

3.    Slopes greater than forty percent (40%).

C.    Buffers Included in Net Site Area. Buffers for the above critical areas shall be considered part of the net site area but may only be altered per Chapter 15.700 SMC, Critical Areas. Development on a site with wetlands, streams, or steep slopes shall meet all Federal, State and local laws and regulations. Units shall be clustered on the developable portion of the site.

	Example: Net Site Area. The net site area (crosshatched in this illustration) excludes critical areas, such as wetlands, but includes critical area buffers.	
[IMAGE]


D.    Example. The following example illustrates the calculation of maximum density for a sample property in the UH-900 (Urban High Residential) zone. The sample property is ten (10) acres in size and contains two (2) acres of wetlands and one (1) acre of wetland buffer:

	Net Site Area = Total Site Area – Critical Areas

	Net Site Area = 10 Acres – 2 Acres = 8 Acres

	Net Site Area / Minimum Lot Size = Maximum # of Allowed Units

	8 Acres (348,480 Square Feet) / 900 sf = 387 Units

This calculation is the maximum number of allowable units for the site. The actual number of units shall be determined by site design and must meet all required development standards of the zoning and building codes. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.510.100 Site Design and Building Orientation

Purpose: Design multi-family sites to have both an external orientation to the streetscape and an internal orientation to the residential environment with unifying pedestrian pathways and recreation space. Arrange sites to enhance the mutual relationship of buildings, streets, recreation space and other site amenities, in order to create a pedestrian-oriented environment. Design emphasis shall be given to the pedestrian, rather than the auto, environment. The privacy and security of residents must be appropriately addressed and site design shall also promote compatibility with adjacent land uses. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.510.110 Building Orientation

Intent: Provide a building presence on the street for convenient pedestrian access, to provide “eyes on the street” and to contribute to the streetscape with visually interesting buildings.

A.    Building Orientation/Location of Primary Entrance. The front facade of a building shall be oriented to the street abutting the front property line, with the primary entrance(s) located on the front facade and clear connections to the sidewalk.

	Example: This building is located facing the street with a prominent entrance and pedestrian path to the sidewalk.	
[IMAGE]


B.    Multiple Building Complexes. In complexes with several buildings, buildings shall orient to the street as in subsection (A) of this section and any additional buildings may be oriented in one (1) of the following manners:

1.    Orient to Courtyard/Recreation Space. Buildings shall be oriented to a courtyard, plaza or other recreation space and include a prominent pedestrian entry to the site and walkways connecting directly to the public sidewalk.

2.    Orient to Pedestrian/Recreation Space System. Buildings shall be oriented to a cohesive system of recreation space and pedestrian walkways with a prominent pedestrian entry to the site and walkways connecting directly to the public sidewalk.

3.    Entries in Multiple Building Complexes. In multiple building complexes, building entries shall be visible from the street, or, if this is not possible, from other buildings and pedestrian walkways.

C.    Exceptions. When physical site limitations such as topography or other natural features prevent the main entrance from being located on the street-facing facade, the building may be oriented to a courtyard with a prominent pedestrian entrance and clear connection to the public sidewalk. (Ord. 18-1029 § 1; Ord. 15-1018 § 1)


15.510.120 Building Placement/Setbacks

Intent: Arrange buildings to create a pedestrian-oriented environment and enhance the relationship of buildings to the street and to each other.

A.    Setbacks/Dimensional Standards. Building setbacks and other dimensional standards for multi-family projects are located in the standards charts in SMC 15.400.100 and 15.400.200. Special standards for maximum front yard setbacks are also provided in the following sections:

A.    Vehicle Entrances in Parking Structures. Parking located under or within buildings shall subordinate the garage entrance to the pedestrian entrance in terms of location and design.

B.    Minimizing Views into the Parking Structure Interior.

1.    Screening. Parking located at grade under a building shall be attractively screened through a combination of decorative grilles, or trelliswork. Screening shall provide for light, airflow, and natural surveillance into the structure, while limiting access. Since screening is intended to increase security by restricting access to the facility, the screening must be reasonably strong and durable to withstand vandalism and the elements.

2.    Screening of Garages Serving Individual Units. Separate enclosed garages serving individual units shall be completely enclosed or shall be screened as described above.

C.    Underground Structures. For underground structures, the first level below grade shall be daylighted by either grading the site down or using air wells to allow natural light and ventilation into the structure. Such openings shall be barred to prevent access and landscaped in a manner that provides both screening and visibility through the landscaping. Openings shall be adjacent to well-traveled walks or frequently used areas of open space.

Applications for a nonconforming sign permit shall contain the name and address of the sign user, the sign owner, and the owner of the property upon which the sign is located and such other pertinent information as the Administrator may require to ensure compliance with the code, including proof of the date of installation of the sign.

It is provided, however, that if the affected, nonresponding business owners or operators do not pay the twenty-five-dollar ($25.00) cost by the time that the 1995 City of SeaTac business licenses are due or paid, whichever is earlier, then the twenty-five-dollar ($25.00) assessment shall be added to and included in the amount to be paid by said business owner or operator for the business’s 1995 business license. The notice referred to above shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the business owner or operator at the address listed on the business license records for the business. Failure of a business owner or operator to comply with this requirement shall constitute a violation of the City Code, enforceable through any and all procedures available for enforcement of City Code violations, as provided in the City Code; provided, that payment of the twenty-five-dollar ($25.00) assessment shall constitute full compliance herewith.

B.    In order to recognize the payments already made by business owners or operators who have complied with the sign inventory survey and paid a five-dollar ($5.00) payment in connection therewith prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, those business owners or operators shall receive a five-dollar ($5.00) offset against their 1995 business license application fee. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.600.200 Variance from Sign Code

A.    Scope. This section establishes the procedure and criteria that the City will use in making a decision upon an application for a variance from the provisions of the Sign Code.

B.    Applicability. This section applies to each application for a variance from the provisions of the Sign Code.

C.    Purpose. A variance is a mechanism by which the City may grant relief from the provisions of the Sign Code where practical difficulty renders compliance with the provisions of that code an unnecessary hardship, where the hardship is a result of the physical characteristics of the subject property and where the purpose of that code can be fulfilled.

D.    Who May Apply. The property owner may apply for a variance from the provisions of the Sign Code.

E.    Submittal Requirements.

1.    The Administrator shall specify the submittal requirements including type, detail and number of copies for a variance application to be deemed complete and accepted for filing.

2.    The Administrator may waive specific submittal requirements determined to be unnecessary for review of an application.

F.    Decision Criteria. The Hearing Examiner may approve or approve with modification the application for a variance from the provisions of the Sign Code if:

1.    The variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation upon signage and uses of other properties in the vicinity and zone in which the property, on behalf of which the application was filed, is located; and

2.    That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is situated; and

3.    The proposed sign shows an exceptional effort toward creating visual harmony between the signs, structures, and other features of the property through the use of a consistent design theme; and

4.    The special circumstances of the subject property are not the result of the actions of the applicant.

G.    Limitation of Authority. The Hearing Examiner may not grant a variance to:

1.    Any dimensional request of the Sign Code greater than fifty percent (50%) of the required dimension of a sign (setbacks from a property line shall not be deemed a dimensional standard of sign); or

2.    The number of signs permitted on a site or zone classification; or

3.    The general provisions of this code or any other procedural or administrative provisions of the code that do not directly apply to this chapter; or

4.    The provisions of the Sign Code which are not subject to variances shall include, by the terms of this code, type of signs and any prohibited or illegal signs, and the dimensional standards of the changeable portion of an electronic sign;

5.    Roof Signs. Notwithstanding SMC 15.600.120, Prohibited Signs, a roof sign may be allowed through a variance process provided the following criteria are met in addition to the decision criteria listed under subsection (F) of this section:

a.    The site does not front on any street and is more than two hundred (200) feet from a public right-of-way;

b.    The sign is no greater than necessary for adequate visibility from the nearest public street. Adequate visibility shall be determined by the size of sign allowed in the subject zone, plus a factor for distance from the nearest public street;

c.    No other primary signage exists or shall be allowed for the site;

d.    The sign is installed in such a manner that there shall be no visible support structure;

6.    Off-Premises Signs. Notwithstanding SMC 15.600.120, Prohibited Signs, an off-premises sign may be allowed through a variance process provided the following criteria are met in addition to the decision criteria listed under subsection (F) of this section:

a.    For a primary sign:

i.    Primary signage cannot be located on the site.

ii.    The sign displays only information directly related to the use of property of the subject business or property for which the variance is granted.

iii.    The sign is located as close as possible to the subject business or property.

b.    For a directional sign:

i.    The applicant demonstrates that his premises are located such that on-premises directional signs are inadequate to reasonably apprise the public of the location of the premises, because the premises lacks any direct street frontage.

H.    Time Limitation. A variance automatically expires and is void if the applicant fails to file for a sign permit or other necessary development permits within two (2) years of the effective date of the variance unless:

1.    The applicant has received an extension pursuant to subsection (I) of this section; or

2.    The variance approval provides for a greater time period due to circumstances.

I.    Extension.

1.    The Code Administrator may extend a variance, not to exceed one (1) year, if:

a.    Unforeseen circumstances or conditions necessitate the extension of the variance; and

b.    Termination of the variance would result in unreasonable hardship to the applicant, and the applicant is not directly responsible for the delay; and

c.    The extension of the variance will not cause substantial detriment to existing uses in the immediate vicinity of the subject property.

2.    The Administrator may grant no more than two (2) extensions. A second extension may be granted if:

a.    Unforeseen circumstances or conditions necessitate the extension of the variance;

b.    The applicant has demonstrated reasonable diligence in attempting to meet the time limit imposed;

c.    Conditions in the immediate vicinity of the subject property have not changed substantially since the variance was first granted.

J.    Assurance Device. In appropriate circumstances, the City may require a reasonable performance bond or other financial method in order to assure compliance with the provisions of the Sign Code and any variances as approved. (Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.700.015 Definitions

Alteration

Alterations include, but are not limited to, grading, filling, channelizing, dredging, clearing of vegetation, construction, compaction, excavation, or any other activity that changes the character of a critical area or its buffer.

Base Flood

A flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, often referred to as the “one hundred (100) year flood.”

Base Flood Elevation

The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929.

Buffer or Buffer Zone

The area contiguous with a critical area that maintains the functions and/or structural stability of the critical area.

Creation

The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site, where a wetland did not previously exist. Creation results in a gain in wetland acreage and function. A typical action is the excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod and hydric soils, and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species.

Critical Area

Any of those areas in the City which are subject to natural hazards or those land features which support unique, fragile or valuable natural resources including fishes, wildlife and other organisms and their habitat, and such resources which carry, hold or purify water in their natural state. Critical areas include coal mine hazard areas, erosion hazard areas, flood hazard areas, landslide hazard areas, seismic hazard areas, steep slope hazard areas, streams, volcanic hazard areas, wetlands and critical aquifer recharge areas. For purposes of this chapter, wellhead protection areas and general groundwater resources are not considered to be critical aquifer recharge areas.

Critical Drainage Area

An area which has been formally defined in the City Surface Water Management Program to require more restrictive regulation than is standard in noncritical areas of the City in order to mitigate severe flooding, water quality issues, erosion or sedimentation problems which result from the cumulative impacts of development and urbanization.

Enhancement

The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a wetland to heighten, intensify, or improve specific function(s) or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present. Enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement, flood water retention, or wildlife habitat. Enhancement results in a change in wetland function(s) and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions, but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Examples are planting vegetation, controlling non-native or invasive species, and modifying site elevations to alter hydroperiods.

Erosion and Deposition

The removal of soils and the placement of these removed soils elsewhere by the natural forces of wind and/or water runoff.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Floodway

The channel of the stream and that portion of the adjoining floodplain which is necessary to contain and discharge the base flood flow without increasing the base flood elevation more than one (1) foot.

Flood Fringe

That portion of the floodplain outside of the zero-rise floodway (see “Floodway, Zero-Rise”) which is covered by floodwater during the base flood, generally associated with standing water rather than rapidly flowing water.

Flood Hazard Areas

Those areas in the City subject to inundation by the base flood including, but not limited to, streams, lakes, wetlands and closed depressions.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)

The official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated some of the major areas of flood hazard.

Flood Insurance Study for King County

The official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration which includes flood profiles and the flood insurance rate map.

Floodplain

The total area subject to inundation by the base flood.

Floodproofing

Adaptations, pursuant to the Building Code, which will make a structure that is below the flood protection elevation substantially impermeable to the passing of water and resistant to hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads including the impacts of buoyancy.

Flood Protection Elevation

An elevation which is one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.

Floodway, Zero-Rise

The channel of a stream and that portion of the adjoining floodplain which is necessary to contain and discharge the base flood flow without any measurable increase in flood height. A measurable increase in base flood height means a calculated upward rise in the base flood elevation, equal to or greater than 0.01 foot, resulting from a comparison of existing conditions and changed conditions directly attributable to development in the floodplain. This definition is broader than that of the FEMA floodway, but always includes the FEMA floodway. The boundaries of the one hundred (100) year floodplains, as shown on the FIRM maps for King County, are considered the boundaries of the zero-rise floodway unless otherwise delineated by a critical area report.

Functions and Values

The services provided by critical areas to society, including but not limited to improving and maintaining water quality, providing fish and wildlife habitat, supporting terrestrial and aquatic food chains, reducing flooding and erosive flows, wave attenuation, historical or archaeological importance, educational opportunities, and recreation.

Hazardous Production Material (HPM)

A solid, liquid or gas that has a degree of hazard rating in health, flammability or reactivity of 3 or 4 as ranked by Fire Code Standard No. 79-3 and which is used directly in research, laboratory or production processes which have, as their end product, materials which are not hazardous.

Hazardous Substances

Any solid, liquid, gas or sludge, including any material, substance, product, commodity or waste, regardless of quantity, that exhibits any of the physical, chemical or biological properties described in WAC 173-303-090 or 173-303-100.

Ordinary High Water Mark

The mark found by examining the bed and banks of a stream and ascertaining where the presence and action of waters are common and long maintained in ordinary years as to mark upon the soil a vegetative character distinct from that of the abutting upland. In any area where the ordinary high water mark cannot be found, the line of mean high water shall substitute. In any area where neither can be found, the top of the channel or lake bank shall substitute. In braided channels and alluvial fans, the ordinary high water mark or line of mean high water shall be measured so as to include the entire stream feature.

Qualified Professional

A person with experience and training in the pertinent scientific discipline, and who is a qualified scientific expert with expertise appropriate for the relevant critical area subject in accordance with WAC 365-195-905. A qualified professional must have obtained a B.S. or B.A. or equivalent degree in biology, engineering, environmental studies, fisheries, geomorphology, or related field, and have at least five years of related work experience.

A.    A qualified professional for wetlands must be a professional wetland scientist or hydrogeologist licensed in the State of Washington with at least two (2) years of full-time work experience as a wetlands professional, including delineating wetlands using the Federal manuals and supplements, preparing wetlands reports, conducting function assessments, and developing and implementing mitigation plans.

B.    A qualified professional for habitat must have a degree in biology or a related degree and professional experience related to the subject species.

C.    A qualified professional for a geological hazard must be a professional engineer or geologist, licensed in the State of Washington.

D.    A qualified professional for critical aquifer recharge areas means a hydrogeologist, geologist, or engineer licensed in the State of Washington, or other scientist with experience in preparing hydrogeologic assessments.

Reestablishment

The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. Reestablishment results in rebuilding a former wetland and results in a gain in wetland acres and functions. Activities could include removing fill, plugging ditches, or breaking drain tiles.

Rehabilitation

The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions and processes of a degraded wetland. Rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or returning tidal influence to a wetland.

Restoration

Measures taken to restore an altered or damaged natural feature, including:

A.    Active steps taken to restore damaged wetlands, streams, protected habitat, or their buffers to the functioning condition that existed prior to an unauthorized alteration; and

B.    Actions performed to reestablish structural and functional characteristics of a critical area that have been lost by alteration, past management activities, or catastrophic events.

Retention/Detention Facility

A type of drainage facility designed either to hold water for a considerable length of time and to release it by evaporation, plant transpiration and/or infiltration into the ground, or to hold runoff via structural controls and then release it to the surface and storm drainage system.

Retention/Detention Facility, Regional

A surface water control structure installed in or adjacent to a drainage facility, stream or wetland of a basin or sub-basin by the City or a project proponent, as required by the City. Such facilities protect downstream properties from predicted significant regional basin flooding or erosion problems.

Seismic Hazard Area

Those areas in the City subject to severe risk of earthquake damage as a result of soil liquefaction in areas underlain by cohesionless soils of low density and usually in association with a shallow groundwater table or other seismically induced settlement.

SEPA

The State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW) and the adopted City environmental policies.

Shoreline Master Program

The applicable City and State laws/codes related to the shoreline programs.

Steep Slope Hazard Areas

Those areas in the City on slopes of forty percent (40%) or greater within a vertical elevation change of at least twenty (20) feet. A slope is delineated by establishing its toe and top, and is measured by averaging the inclination over at least ten (10) feet of vertical relief.

Stream

A course or route, formed by nature, including those modified by man, generally consisting of a channel with a bed, banks, or sides substantially throughout its length, along which surface waters naturally and normally flow in draining from higher to lower lands. Normal rainfall is rainfall that is at or near the mean of the accumulated annual rainfall record, based upon the water year as recorded at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Pursuant to the critical areas section, there are the following stream classifications:

A.    Class 1 streams, only including streams inventoried as “Shorelines of the State” under the adopted Shoreline Master Program, pursuant to Chapter 90.58 RCW;

B.    Class 2 streams, only including streams smaller than Class 1 streams which flow year-round during years of normal rainfall or those which are used by salmonids; and

C.    Class 3 streams, only including streams which are intermittent or ephemeral during years of normal rainfall and which are not used by salmonids.

Stream Functions

Natural processes performed by streams including functions which are important in facilitating food chain production; providing habitat for nesting, rearing and resting sites for aquatic, terrestrial and avian species; maintaining the availability and quality of water, such as purifying water; acting as recharge and discharge areas for groundwater aquifers; moderating surface and stormwater flows and maintaining the free flowing conveyance of water, sediments and other organic matter.

Wetland

Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from non-wetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from non-wetland areas to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

Wetland Edge

The line delineating the outer edge of a wetland established in accordance with the approved Federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplements.

Wetland, Forested

A wetland with at least thirty percent (30%) of the surface area covered by woody vegetation greater than twenty (20) feet in height that is at least partially rooted within the wetland.

Wetland Functions

Natural processes performed by wetlands, including functions which are important in facilitating food chain production, providing habitat for nesting, rearing and resting sites for aquatic, terrestrial and avian species, maintaining availability and quality of water, acting as recharge and discharge areas for groundwater aquifers and moderating surface and stormwater flows, as well as providing other functions including, but not limited to, those set forth in 33 CFR 320.4(b)(2), 1988.

Wetland, Isolated

A wetland that is outside of and not contiguous to any one hundred (100) year flood plain of a lake, river or stream, and has no contiguous hydric soil or hydrophytic vegetation between the wetland and any surface water including other wetlands.

Wetland Mitigation Bank

A site where wetlands are restored, created, enhanced, or in exceptional circumstances preserved expressly for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of unavoidable impacts to wetlands or other aquatic resources typically unknown at the time of certification to compensate for future, permitted impacts to similar resources.

Wetland Mosaic

An area with a concentration of multiple small wetlands, in which each patch of wetland is less than one (1) acre; on average, patches are less than one hundred (100) feet from each other; and areas delineated as vegetated wetland are more than fifty percent (50%) of the total area of the entire mosaic, including uplands and open water.

Wet Meadow, Grazed

Palustrine emergent wetland typically having up to six (6) inches of standing water during the wet season and dominated under normal conditions by meadow emergents such as reed, canary grass, spike rushes, bulrushes, sedges and other rushes. During the growing season, the soil is often saturated but not covered with water. These meadows frequently have been or are being used for livestock activities.

Wet Pond

An artificial water body constructed as a part of a surface water management system. (Ord. 16-1016 § 1 (Exh. B); Ord. 15-1018 § 1)

15.700.285 Wetlands – Development Standards

A development proposal on a site containing a wetland shall meet the following requirements:

A.    Buffers Required. A buffer shall be established adjacent to designated wetland areas. The purpose of the buffer area shall be to protect the integrity, functions and values of the wetland area. Buffer widths shall be appropriate for the sensitivity of the wetland and for the risks associated with land use development.

B.    Standard Buffers Comply with BAS. The following standard buffers have been established in accordance with the best available science (codified at WAC 365-195-900 through 365-195-925). They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional.

Standard Wetland Buffers 

The following table specifies standard buffers, which may be modified pursuant to subsections (E) through (I) of this section: 

	Wetland Category	Habitat Score

	3 – 4	5	6 – 7	8 – 9

	 	Buffer Width in Feet

	Category I	75	105	165	225

	Category II	75	105	165	225

	Category III	60	105	165	225

	Category IV	40

C.    Impact Minimization Measures Required. The use of the standard buffer widths requires the implementation of the measures in the following table, where applicable, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses. Activities listed under “Examples of Activities That Cause Disturbances” include but are not limited to those listed. If an applicant chooses not to apply those measures, then a thirty-three percent (33%) increase in the width of all buffers is required. For example, a seventy-five (75) foot buffer with the measures implemented would increase to a one hundred (100) foot buffer without them.

Wetland Impact Minimization Measures  

	Disturbance	Examples of Activities and Uses That Cause Disturbances	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights 	• Parking lots

• Warehouses

• Industrial

• Multi-family residential 	• Direct lights away from wetland

	Noise in excess of limitations as set forth in SMC 15.460.020 	• Industrial

• Parking lots

• Multi-family residential	• Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

	Toxic runoff	• Parking lots

• Roads

• Industrial

• Residential

• Pesticide application

• Landscaping	• Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

• Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 ft of wetland

• Apply integrated pest management*

	Stormwater runoff 	• Roads

• Driveways

• Parking lots	• Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

• Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer

• Use LID BMPs

	Changes in water regime 	• Impervious surfaces

• Lawns

• Tilling	• Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance 	• Single-family residential

• Multi-family residential

• Leash free dog park	• Use privacy fencing OR plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the regional ecology

• Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement

	Dust 	• Excavation

• Construction	• Use best management practices to control dust

* “Integrated pest management” is defined as the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment.

D.    Vegetated Buffer Assumption. The buffer widths assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the regional ecology. If the existing buffer is sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer shall either be planted to create the appropriate plant community or widened to ensure that functions and values of the buffer are adequately provided.

E.    Increased Buffers. Increased buffer widths may be required on a case-by-case basis when necessary to protect wetland functions and values. This determination shall be supported by a critical area report or other appropriate documentation showing that it is reasonably related to protection of the functions and values of the wetland, or when:

1.    The buffer is within twenty-five (25) feet of the top or toe of a slope that is greater than thirty percent (30%); or

2.    The slope is susceptible to erosion and standard best management practices (BMPs) and erosion-control measures will not prevent adverse impacts to the wetland.

F.    Buffer Width Averaging. Buffer width averaging may be allowed in accordance with an approved critical area report; provided, that all of the following criteria are met:

1.    It will not reduce protection to wetlands or their functions;

2.    The total area contained in the buffer after averaging does not decrease;

3.    The buffer at its narrowest point is not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the standard width; and

4.    The critical area report shall describe the current functions and values of the wetland and its buffer, and the measures that will be taken to ensure that there is no loss of wetland function due to averaging.

G.    Reduced Buffer Allowance. Reduced buffers may be allowed, with enhancements, in accordance with an approved critical area report, provided:

1.    The existing condition of the buffer is degraded, and

2.    Additional protection to the wetland is provided through the implementation of a buffer enhancement plan.

3.    Buffer enhancement may include, but is not limited to:

a.    Planting native vegetation that would increase value for fish and wildlife habitat, improve water quality, or provide aesthetic or recreational value;

b.    Enhancement of wildlife habitat by incorporating structures that are likely to be used by wildlife, including wood duck boxes, bat boxes, nesting platforms, snags, rootwads, stumps, birdhouses, and nesting areas;

c.    Removing non-native plant species and noxious weeds from the buffer area and replanting the area subject to subsection (G)(3)(a) of this section.

H.    Buffer Reductions Limited. Buffer reductions under this section shall be limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of the standard buffer width.

I.    Buffer Exemption. When a property redevelops, if portions of a buffer width required by this chapter are already developed with legally established physical improvements (e.g., buildings, pavement), those portions of the proposed redevelopment area within the required buffer width are exempt from the buffer requirements of this chapter.

J.    Buffers on Mitigation Sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter. Buffers shall be based on the target or expected category of the wetland.

K.    Determination by Wetland Professional. Alterations to buffer width requirements pursuant to this section shall be determined by a qualified wetland professional using established methodologies and approved Federal and State manuals.

L.    Hazardous Substances Prohibited. The use of hazardous substances, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers in a wetland or its buffer is prohibited except as provided in SMC 15.700.290(D). (Ord. 16-1016 § 1 (Exh. B); Ord. 15-1018 § 1. Formerly 15.700.280)

15.700.310 Wetlands – Mitigation Requirements

A.    Requirements for Compensatory Mitigation.

1.    Compensatory mitigation for alterations to wetlands shall be used only:

a.    When impacts cannot be addressed by steps 1 through 4 of SMC 15.700.120(A);

b.    And shall not apply to allowed alterations pursuant to SMC 15.700.285(F), (G), or (I);

c.    And shall achieve equivalent or greater biological functions.

2.    Compensatory mitigation plans shall be consistent with this chapter and Wetland Mitigation in Washington State, Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans, Version 1, (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b) or as amended, and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Western Washington) (Publication No. 09-06-32, Olympia, WA, December 2009), or other best available science as recommended by Dept. of Ecology.

3.    A performance bond or other approved financial surety is required before any project permits are issued. The purpose of the financial surety is to hold an applicant accountable for implementing the mitigation and monitoring plans. The release of financial surety is contingent on satisfactory completion by the applicant of the proposed construction mitigation and monitoring plans.

4.    Mitigation ratios shall be consistent with subsection (G) of this section.

B.    Compensating for Lost or Affected Functions. Compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project, with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions. The goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost, except when either:

1.    The lost wetland provides minimal functions, and the proposed compensatory mitigation action(s) will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed through a formal Washington State watershed assessment plan or protocol; or

2.    Out-of-kind replacement will best meet formally identified regional goals, such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types.

C.    Preference of Mitigation Actions. Mitigation for lost or diminished wetland and buffer functions shall rely on the types below in the following order of preference:

1.    Restoration (Reestablishment and Rehabilitation) of Wetlands.

a.    The goal of reestablishment is returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland.

b.    The goal of rehabilitation is repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland.

2.    Creation (Establishment) of Wetlands on Disturbed Upland Sites Such as Those with Vegetative Cover Consisting Primarily of Non-Native Species or Noxious Weeds. This should be attempted only when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive to the wetland community that is anticipated in the design.

3.    Enhancement of Significantly Degraded Wetlands in Combination with Restoration or Creation. Enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the altered area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands or associated buffers shall demonstrate:

a.    How the proposed enhancement will increase the wetland’s/buffer’s functions and values;

b.    How this increase in function will adequately compensate for the impacts; and

c.    How all other existing wetland functions and values at the mitigation site will be protected.

4.    Preservation of high quality, at-risk wetlands as compensation is generally acceptable when done in combination with restoration, creation, or enhancement; provided, that a minimum of 1:1 acreage replacement is provided by reestablishment or creation. Ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation generally range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being altered and the quality of the wetlands being preserved.

D.    Location of Compensatory Mitigation. Mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply:

1.    There are no reasonable on-site or in subdrainage basin opportunities, or on-site and in subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success due to development pressures, adjacent land uses, or on-site buffers or connectivity are inadequate;

2.    On-site mitigation would require elimination of high quality upland habitat;

3.    Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions; and

4.    Off-site locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin and in the same water resource inventory area (WRIA) unless:

a.    Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions and values have been established and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or

b.    Credits from a State-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation, and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument;

c.    If compensatory wetland or wetland buffer mitigation is proposed off site, a signed statement of consent is required from owners of all affected properties. This statement shall be submitted to the City and a notice recorded with the King County Recorder prior to approval of a compensatory mitigation plan.

E.    Responsible Party for Mitigation Site. Mitigation for lost or diminished critical area functions and values for either wetlands or streams shall use the following options:

1.    Applicant-Responsible Mitigation. The applicant is responsible for the implementation, monitoring and success of the mitigation pursuant to this chapter.

2.    Non-Applicant-Responsible Mitigation – In-Lieu Fee Mitigation.

a.    Funds are collected from the applicant by the sponsoring agency, nonprofit, private party or jurisdiction. The sponsor is responsible from that point forward for the completion and success of the mitigation. The applicant’s fee is based on the project impact and includes all costs for the mitigation, including design, land acquisition, materials, construction, administration, monitoring, and stewardship.

b.    Credits purchased by an applicant from an in-lieu fee mitigation program that is certified under Federal and State rules may be used as a method of mitigation if approved by the City to compensate for impacts when all of the following apply:

i.    The City determines as part of the critical area approval that it would provide equivalent or greater replacement of wetland functions and values when compared to conventional permittee-responsible mitigation;

ii.    The City reviews and approves the assessment of debits associated with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant’s qualified professional using the credit assessment method or appropriate method for the impact as specified in the approved instrument for the program;

iii.    The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the in-lieu fee program instrument; and

iv.    The compensatory mitigation agreement occurs before the building or grading and clearing permits for the authorized impact.

F.    Timing of Compensatory Mitigation. Mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development causing the wetland alteration. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing wildlife and flora.

G.    Wetland Mitigation Ratios. In the following table the first number indicates the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second number indicates the acreage of wetlands altered.

	Category and Type of Wetland	Creation or Reestablishment	Rehabilitation	Enhancement

	Category I: Mature Forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I: Based on Functions	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

H.    Illegal Alteration.

1.    When a wetland or its buffer has been altered in violation of this chapter, all ongoing development work on the site shall stop and the critical area shall be restored. The City shall have the authority to issue a “stop work” order, pursuant to Chapter 1.15 SMC, to cease all ongoing development work and order restoration, rehabilitation, or replacement measures at the owner’s or other responsible party’s expense to compensate for violating provisions of this chapter.

15.700.370 Fish and Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas

A.    Purpose. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation means land management for maintaining species in a wild state in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that isolated subpopulations are not created. This does not mean maintaining all individuals of all species at all times. It does mean that cooperative and coordinated land use planning is critically important among counties and cities in a region. In some cases, it may be sufficient to assure that a species will usually be found in certain regions across the State. In other cases, it may be necessary to assure protection to each individual species. Protection needs to be species specific and goal-oriented. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas include:

1.    Areas with which endangered, threatened, and sensitive species, including anadromous fish, have a primary association;

2.    Habitats and species of local importance;

3.    Naturally occurring lakes or ponds under twenty (20) acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide fish or wildlife habitat;

4.    Waters of the State;

5.    Lakes, ponds, and streams planted with game fish by a governmental or tribal entity.

“Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas” does not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that lie within the boundaries of and are maintained by a port district or an irrigation district or company.

B.    Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas may, and probably will, include one (1) or more of other critical areas identified in this chapter. The following classification system is based on the presence of one (1) or more of these critical areas as well as species identified as endangered, threatened, sensitive, or priority, the area’s proximity to developed areas, and the area’s existing use.

1.    Category 1 habitat is classified as including any wetland or stream or their buffer areas or any area identified as habitat for endangered, threatened, sensitive or priority species by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) or heron, and which is characterized by agricultural or low density residential use (one (1) unit or less per acre) and which is not within two hundred (200) feet of more intense land uses.

2.    Category 2 habitat is classified as including any wetland or stream or their buffer areas or any area identified as habitat for endangered, threatened, sensitive, or priority species by the DFW and which is characterized by residential uses of greater density than one (1) unit per acre or which lies within two hundred (200) feet of more intense land uses.

3.    Category 3 habitat is classified as an area which does not include a wetland or stream or their buffer areas or any area identified as habitat for endangered, threatened, sensitive or priority species by the DFW and which is characterized by single-family residential areas immediately adjacent to multi-family or nonresidential land uses.

4.    Category 4 habitat is classified as an area which does not include a wetland or stream or their buffer areas or any area identified as habitat for endangered, threatened, sensitive, or priority species by the DFW and which is characterized by nonresidential land uses.

C.    Buffers. For any fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas which include other critical areas as identified and regulated in this chapter, the buffer for those critical areas shall apply except where species identified by the DFW as endangered, threatened, sensitive, or priority, or where herons are found to have a primary association. If such species are present, the applicant shall provide a critical area report identifying such species, their required habitat, and recommend appropriate buffers based on the DFW priority habitat and species management recommendations as well as any other proposed mitigation measures considered appropriate to the protection of said species and habitat.

16A.11.010 General

A.    The purpose of the application review process is to review complete applications for consistency and conformance with applicable development regulations prior to proceeding to hearing or rendering permit decisions.

B.    Additional information, corrected or revised plans, or studies may be requested during the review, if determined to be needed. Any time period during which the applicant has been requested to provide such information is excluded from the time frames outlined in Chapter 16A.15 SMC. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 03-1020 § 2)


16A.11.020 Review for Consistency

A.    A proposed project’s consistency with the City’s development standards and regulations adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, or, in the absence of applicable development regulations, the appropriate elements of the Comprehensive Plan adopted under Chapter 36.70A RCW, shall be determined by the City during project review by consideration of:

1.    The type of land use;

2.    The level of development, such as units per acre or other measures of density;

3.    Infrastructure, including public facilities and services needed to serve the development;

4.    The characteristics of the development, such as building design standards and adherence to all applicable life safety standards; and

5.    The design of the project in conformity with the City’s standards.

    Upon determination by the City that a complete application contains sufficient information to determine consistency and conformance with City regulations, the project permit application will be reviewed and can proceed to hearing or a project permit decision rendered administratively.

    During project review, the City or any subsequent reviewing body shall not reexamine alternatives to or hear appeals on the items identified in this section, except for issues of code interpretation. Nothing in this section limits the City’s authority to approve, condition, or deny a project as provided in its development regulations and its policies adopted under RCW 43.21C.060. Project review shall be used to identify specific project design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage swales, transportation demand management, or other measures, to mitigate a proposal’s probable adverse environmental impacts, if applicable.

B.    Review Procedure. The general procedure for review of an application is for the receiving department to route the application to all other departments that will contribute to the review. After each department has reviewed the application with respect to their applicable regulations and standards, comments will be compiled and a comment letter sent to the applicant. Subsequent reviews will be required until all comments have been addressed in revised plans and documents.

    For procedures specific to a permit type, please see instructions attached to the permit application. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 03-1020 § 2)


16A.11.030 SEPA Review

A.    Development subject to the provisions of the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) shall be reviewed in accordance with the policies and procedures contained in Chapter 16A.23 SMC.

B.    Timing of Review. SEPA review will generally be conducted at the preliminary design phase of a project, allowing for site plan review prior to the submittal of detailed building plans. This will allow the applicant to integrate required mitigations into the project design with less cost.

    Despite the general advantage to an applicant of submitting for SEPA review at the preliminary design phase, prior to submittal of detailed building plans, the City will accept and review building permit applications concurrently with SEPA review if a developer chooses to sign a specific authorization for such joint review.

Chapter 16A.19 OPTIONAL CONSOLIDATED PROJECT REVIEW PROCESS

Sections: 

16A.19.010    General

16A.19.020    Contents


16A.19.010 General

This optional process allows for the consideration of all discretionary land use, environmental, engineering and building permits issued by the City, together with project permits requiring a public hearing, as a single project, if so desired and requested in writing by the applicant. Permit decisions of other agencies are not included in this process; but public meetings and hearings for other agencies may be coordinated with those of the City. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 03-1020 § 2)


16A.19.020 Contents

Where multiple permits are required for a single project, the optional consolidated project review process is available and is composed of the following:

A.    A preapplication meeting. 

    The preapplication meeting process will be adapted by the review authority to accommodate the consolidated project permit review of applications. The consolidated process will generally follow the path of the highest level type permit application.

B.    A permit coordinator, designated from the most appropriate department based on the applications submitted.

C.    A single application packet based on the project permits requested to be consolidated.

D.    A single determination of completeness. 

    Upon acceptance of a consolidated application, all appropriate City staff and relevant other agency staff may meet to determine, within twenty-eight (28) days, whether the accepted application is complete and whether a consolidated determination of completeness should be issued consistent with Chapter 16A.07 SMC.

E.    A single notice of application. 

    When the application is deemed complete, a consolidated notice of application will be issued and/or posted consistent with the provisions of Chapter 16A.09 SMC.

F.    A single comment period.

    The combined, affected staff may meet as needed with the applicant and/or interested public prior to the issuance of a decision.

G.    A consolidated administrative decision for applicable Type I or Type II project permit.

    The review authority will issue decisions for Type I and Type II nonhearing administrative permits. Any administrative decisions will be issued with sufficient time for appeal period(s) to place appeals on the same Hearing Examiner agenda date as any companion Type III land use permit requiring a public hearing. Appeals of Type I or Type II administrative permits will be heard in a single, consolidated open record appeal hearing before the Hearing Examiner, unless otherwise specified by statute.

H.    A single notice of hearing and open record public hearing, if required.

1.    A consolidated report and recommendation will be developed for the Type III open record hearing portion of the project permit application.

2.    A consolidated report will be developed which will summarize Type I or Type II administrative project permit decisions (if any) and provide an appropriate consolidated response to any appeals of administrative Type I or Type II project permits. To the extent possible, appeal hearings of administrative Type I or Type II project permits shall be consolidated with open record public hearings for Type III project permit applications.

    If the Hearing Examiner’s deliberations include an open record appeal hearing or an appeal of an engineering or building/construction administrative permit, the Hearing Examiner may keep the record open for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, unless agreed to in writing by both the Hearing Examiner and the applicant, and may request submission of a recommendation from one (1) or more neutral, technical advisory boards or other sources chosen by the Hearing Examiner. Alternatively, technical issues may, by statute, necessarily be heard by special boards.

I.    A single consolidated public hearing decision.

1.    The Hearing Examiner will issue a consolidated decision and a consolidated notice of decision regarding all administrative Type I and Type II project permit applications requiring an open record public hearing, consistent with the provisions of these procedures.

2.    The Hearing Examiner’s decision is appealable only to Superior Court. Shoreline permit appeals are appealable only to the State Shoreline Hearings Board. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 03-1020 § 2)

2.    If the proposal is an “action,” whether it is categorically exempt from the requirements of SEPA; and

3.    If the proposal is a nonexempt action, whether appropriate environmental review of the project has been conducted or commenced.

B.    It is recognized that a particular development or land use, though otherwise consistent with City regulations and policies, may create adverse impacts upon facilities, services, natural systems or the surrounding area when aggregated with the impacts of prior or reasonably anticipated future developments. The City shall evaluate such cumulative environmental impacts and make its environmental determinations and substantive decisions accordingly.

E.    The responsible official may determine that the City will complete all or part of an environmental checklist for a private proposal with its own staff, or may contract with one (1) or more consultants to prepare or assist in preparation of a checklist, and may charge and collect fees from the applicant to cover costs incurred by the City in preparation of the checklist, if either of the following circumstances exist:

1.    The City has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the applicant; or

2.    The applicant has provided inaccurate or incomplete information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.

    If fees are to be collected, the applicant shall be advised of the estimated costs and shall be required to make payment of such costs prior to the actual preparation of all or part of the environmental checklist. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 04-1008 § 2; Ord. 90-1061 § 7. Formerly 13.30.070)

16A.23.080 Environmental Impact Statement

A.    Whenever the responsible official has issued a determination of significance (DS) for a nonexempt action, it shall be the responsibility of the individual, corporation, agency or City department initiating or proposing the action to prepare a draft EIS and a final EIS under the supervision of the responsible official. Consultants shall be selected based on their expertise and knowledge related to the scoped environmental elements to be analyzed in the EIS documents. Regardless of who prepares an EIS, it is the EIS of the City and the responsible official must be satisfied that the EIS complies with this chapter, with SEPA and with the SEPA rules prior to issuance of the EIS.

B.    The responsible official may determine that City staff will complete all or part of an EIS for a private proposal, or the City may contract with one (1) or more consultants to prepare or assist in preparation of an EIS, and may charge and collect fees from the applicant to cover costs incurred by the City in preparation of the EIS, if one or more of the following circumstances exist:

1.    The City has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the applicant;

2.    The applicant has provided inaccurate or incomplete information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration;

3.    The responsible official and the applicant agree that the City will be responsible for completing the EIS.

    If fees are to be collected, the applicant shall be advised of estimated costs, and shall be required to secure payment of such costs prior to the actual preparation of the EIS. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 04-1008 § 2; Ord. 90-1061 § 8. Formerly 13.30.080)


16A.23.090 Public Notice

A.    Whenever public notice is required under the SEPA rules, the responsible official shall cause notice to be given in the following manner:

1.    By posting the subject property (site specific proposals only); and

2.    By publishing notice in the official newspaper of the City.

B.    Additional public notice may be provided for proposals having, or potentially having, unusually widespread, unique or significant adverse impacts, or, for other proposals, at the discretion of the responsible official. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 04-1008 § 2; Ord. 90-1061 § 9. Formerly 13.30.090)


16A.23.100 Internal Circulation of Environmental Documents

Relevant environmental documents shall accompany proposals through existing City project review processes. The responsible official shall ensure that environmental documents are provided to decision makers in the following manner:

A.    Where a nonelected City official is to make a final decision on a nonexempt action, the responsible official shall provide that deciding official with a copy of a final staff evaluation, a determination of nonsignificance (DNS), a mitigated determination of nonsignificance (MDNS) or a final EIS upon issuance of the DNS or FEIS.

B.    Where the Hearing Examiner is to make a decision on a nonexempt action, the responsible official shall transmit to the Examiner a copy of the following:

1.    Environmental checklist.

2.    The final environmental determination, except for when a determination of significance (DS) has been issued, both a copy of the Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statements shall be provided. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 04-1008 § 2; Ord. 90-1061 § 10. Formerly 13.30.100)


16A.23.110 Timing of Decision on Nonexempt Action

A.    For nonexempt actions, the procedural requirements of SEPA, the SEPA rules and this chapter shall be completed prior to the City’s issuance of a license, permit, or other approval, and prior to the City committing to a particular course of action, or prior to the City making a decision which would either have adverse environmental impacts, or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.

B.    A final decision on a nonexempt action for which a DNS has been issued or an EIS has been required shall not be made until after expiration of the environmental appeal period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a final decision need not be made during pendency of any appeal if deemed appropriate by the City or if an injunction be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 18-1004 § 1; Ord. 04-1008 § 2; Ord. 00-1036 § 2; Ord. 90-1061 § 11. Formerly 13.30.110)


16A.23.120 Authority to Condition or Deny Proposals

A.    The policies and goals set forth and referenced by this chapter are supplementary to other zoning, land use, and regulatory ordinances of the City.

B.    The City may attach conditions to a permit or approval so long as:

1.    Such conditions are necessary to mitigate probable significant adverse environmental impacts identified in environmental documents prepared pursuant to this chapter; and

2.    Such conditions are in writing; and

3.    The mitigation measures included in such conditions are reasonable and capable of being accomplished; and

4.    The City has considered whether other local, state, or federal mitigation measures applicable to the proposal are sufficient to mitigate the identified impacts; and

5.    Such conditions are based on one (1) or more policies, plans, rules or regulations designated in SMC 16A.23.130 as a basis for the exercise of substantive SEPA authority, and cited in the license, permit, ordinance, or other decision document.

C.    The City may deny a permit or approval for a proposal on the basis of SEPA so long as:

1.    A finding is made that approval would result in probable significant adverse environmental impacts which are identified in a final EIS prepared pursuant to this chapter; and

2.    A finding is made that there are no reasonable mitigation measures capable of being accomplished which are sufficient to make the identified impacts nonsignificant; and

3.    The denial is based on one (1) or more policies, plans, rules, or regulations designated in SMC 16A.23.130 as a basis for the exercise of substantive SEPA authority, and cited in the license, permit, ordinance or other decision document.

D.    If the City determines, after the initial review of a project, that a proposed action could not comply with adopted plans, policies, rules or regulations, and where the City has authority other than SEPA to deny the proposal, the project can be denied outright without making a threshold determination, which denial shall be in writing. Proposed actions which are subsequently modified, amended, or deemed to be consistent with adopted plans, policies, rules or regulations shall not receive final approval until the proposed action is in full compliance with SEPA, the SEPA rules, and this chapter.

E.    Where the responsible official has issued a mitigated DNS, the decision maker shall not approve the proposal until:

1.    The proponent has modified the proposal, either through modification of plans and other application materials or through a separate written instrument attached to the application, such that the mitigating measures of the mitigated DNS become part of the proposal; or

2.    The decision maker has incorporated the mitigating measures of the mitigated DNS into the license, permit, ordinance or other approval; or

3.    A combination of the aforesaid.

F.    Where mitigating measures are agreed to, or imposed, and where the proponent fails to implement such mitigating measures, the City shall have the authority to revoke any permit, license or other approval granted on the basis of such mitigating measures.

Chapter 17.04 CPTED CONCEPTS

Sections: 

17.04.010    CPTED Overview


17.04.010 CPTED Overview

A.    Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (“CPTED”) is the proper design and effective use of the built environment in order to reduce the fear and incidence of crime, and improve the quality of life.

B.    CPTED involves the design of a physical space so that it enhances the needs of the intended users. This emphasis on design and use deviates from the traditional “target hardening” approach to crime prevention.

C.    Owners, managers and community users have a joint responsibility to report to the police all suspicious activities and criminal occurrences; without this, the effectiveness of CPTED is minimized. Establishing and maintaining partnerships between the community and the City of SeaTac will create improvement in quality of life issues, make for a safer environment, and a more productive community.

D.    For CPTED to be successful, it must be understandable and practicable for the normal users of the space. The normal users are more familiar with the local area and have a vested interest (their own well-being) in ensuring their immediate environment operates properly. The “Three-D” approach to space assessment provides a simple guide for the normal users in determining the appropriateness of how their space is designed and used. The “Three-D” concept is based on the three functions or dimensions of human space:

1.    DESIGNATION: All human space has some designated purpose. How does the design support function? Is the use clear? Supported by signs?

2.    DEFINITION: All human space has social, cultural, legal or physical definitions that prescribe the desired and acceptable behaviors. Is it clear who owns or manages it?

3.    DESIGN: All human space is designed to support and encourage the desired behaviors. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)

17.08.010 Purpose

The purpose of this title shall be to create standards that address Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED). The purpose of CPTED is the proper design and effective use of the built environment in order to reduce the fear and incidence of crime and to improve the quality of life. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.08.020 Application

A.    Land Use Categories. This title shall apply to all land use categories. Land uses pertaining to single-family residential shall be exempt from this title except for Chapter 17.16 SMC, Security Provisions. To reduce the potential for crime, it is recommended that all CPTED standards are followed for single-family residential uses to the greatest extent possible. If the standards contained in this title conflict with any other provisions of the SeaTac Municipal Code, the stricter interpretation shall apply.

B.    New Construction. This title shall only apply to all new construction, including buildings and site improvements.

C.    Additions Increasing the Gross Floor Area. If the redeveloped, replaced, or additions to construction cause the initial gross floor area (GFA) of the aggregate of buildings on that property to expand beyond eighty percent (80%) in any five (5) year period, then the entire site, including all buildings, landscaping, and exterior lighting shall be subject to this title, except for land uses covered by subsection (E) of this section.

D.    Public/Private Parking Lots, Auto Rental/Sales Lots, and Similar Uses. For public/private parking, auto rental/sales lots, and similar uses where the building occupies only a small portion of the land, as determined by the Director of Community and Economic Development, the following standard shall apply:

    In any five (5) year period, if changes are made to these parcels where the combined cost of development, construction, redevelopment, landscaping, and lighting changes exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the initial assessed value, the entire site, including all buildings, landscaping and lighting shall be subject to this title.

E.    Landscaping. New plantings and changes to landscaping shall be subject to this title. 

F.    Lighting.

1.    Installation of new lighting fixtures shall be subject to this title. Repair or replacement of existing lighting fixtures involving two (2) or less lamps or luminaires is exempt from this title providing that no single lamp exceeds one hundred fifty (150) watts.

2.    The IESNA Lighting Handbook, 9th Edition, published by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America in New York, is hereby adopted to this title by reference.

3.    Standards specified in this title supersede the standards as specified by IESNA. When a standard is not specified within this title, IESNA standards shall apply.

G.    Special Holiday Lighting Exemption. Holiday lighting during the months of November, December, and January shall be exempt from the provisions of this title. (Ord. 11-1002 § 3; Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.08.030 CPTED Principles

CPTED is supported by the following five (5) overlapping principles that are applied to specific sites and situations.

A.    Territoriality. Territoriality is a design concept that clearly delineates private space from semi-public and public spaces and also creates a sense of ownership. Ownership thereby creates an environment where appearances of such strangers and intruders stand out and are more easily identified through: 

1.    The enhanced feeling of legitimate ownership by reinforcing existing natural surveillance and natural access control strategies with additional symbolic or social ones.

2.    The design of space to allow for its continued use and intended purpose.

3.    The use of pavement treatments, landscaping, art, signage, screening and fences define and outline ownership of space. 

B.    Natural Surveillance. Natural surveillance is a design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation. Provision of natural surveillance helps to create environments where there is sufficient opportunity for people engaged in their normal behavior to observe the space around them. Areas can be designed so they are more easily observed through:

1.    Design and placement of physical features to maximize visibility. This may include: building orientation, windows, entrances and exits, parking lots, refuse containers, walkways, guard gates, landscape trees and shrubs, use of wrought iron fences or walls, signage and other physical obstructions.

2.    Placement of persons or activities to maximize surveillance possibilities.

3.    Minimum maintained lighting standards that provide for nighttime illumination of parking lots, walkways, entrances, exits, and related areas to promote a safe environment.

C.    Access Control. Access control is a design concept directed primarily at decreasing criminal accessibility. Provision of natural access control limits access and increases natural surveillance to restrict criminal intrusion, especially into areas where they will not be easily observed. Intruders are more readily recognized through:

1.    The use of sidewalks, pavement, gates, lighting and landscaping to clearly guide the public to and from entrances and exits.

2.    The use of gates, fences, walls, landscaping and lighting to prevent or discourage public access to or from dark or unmonitored areas. 

D. Activity Support. Activity support is the presence of activity planned for the space, and involves placing activity where the individuals engaged in an activity will become part of the natural surveillance system. Examples include:

1.    Place safe activities in areas that will discourage would-be offenders, to increase the natural surveillance of these activities and the perception of safety for normal users, and the perception of risk for offenders.

2.    Place high-risk activities in safer locations to overcome the vulnerability of these activities by using natural surveillance and access control of the safe area.

3.    Locate gathering areas in locations that provide for natural surveillance and access control or in locations away from the view of would-be offenders.

4.    Improve the scheduling of space to allow for effective use and appropriate intensity of accepted behaviors.

E.    Maintenance. Proper maintenance of landscaping, lighting treatment, and other features can facilitate the principles of CPTED. Functions include: 

1.    Proper maintenance of lighting fixtures to prescribed standards. 

2.    Landscaping which is maintained at prescribed standards.

3.    Minimizing the conflicts between surveillance and landscaping as groundcover, shrubs and trees mature. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)

Chapter 17.28 PARKING STRUCTURES

Sections: 

17.28.010    Application

17.28.020    Purpose

17.28.030    Parking Structure Standards

17.28.040    Illuminance Standards


17.28.010 Application

Parking structure standards apply to covered and enclosed facilities intended for use by the general public, for those used by residents, customers, and employees of apartment buildings or commercial developments. They are not intended to apply to parking structures used exclusively for repair or storage of commercial vehicles, or where attendants park vehicles. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.28.020 Purpose

A.    This chapter establishes CPTED design and lighting standards for parking structures. These standards include interior and exterior CPTED strategies for the reasonably safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in parking structures, the enhancement of personal security and deterrence of vandalism, theft and assault while conserving energy and minimizing maintenance.

B.    Parking structures comprise a large volume of space with relatively low levels of activity. Violent crime is more likely to occur in a parking structure than in other commercial facilities. Many parking structures lack CPTED features because property owners and architects are not familiar with basic principles of design concepts for crime prevention. Although CPTED principles can be readily incorporated into parking structures at design and construction stages, it is often difficult and expensive to upgrade security at a later date. Incorporating CPTED can significantly reduce the fear and risk of crime.

C.    Parking lots and parking structures have vehicular speeds that are much lower than roadways. More importantly, the primary purpose of lighting here is to benefit the pedestrian.

D.    The illuminance requirements of a parking facility are affected by the layout, operation and vehicular traffic safety issues, plus the visibility and security needs of pedestrians walking to and from their vehicles. Lighting for parking structures should provide not only the recommended minimum illuminance levels but also good color rendition, uniformity, and minimal glare. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.28.030 Parking Structure Standards

Parking structures shall meet the recommendations of the IESNA Handbook. At a minimum, the following standards shall be used in the construction of parking structures. It is required that the developer comply with Lighting for Parking Facilities, Recommended Practices RP-20-98 and Chapter 22, Roadway Lighting as delineated in the IESNA Handbook, 9th Edition.

A.    For security reasons, it is recommended to locate stairs and elevators adjacent to a street, where the lobbies are visible from the street.

B.    Pedestrian walkways shall be elevated similar to a speed hump/bump in order to allow pedestrians greater visibility and to assist in slowing cars when in the vicinity of pedestrians.

C.    Potential hiding places below stairs shall be closed off. If used for storage, such areas shall be secured with doors and locks.

D.    Directional arrows indicating stairs, elevators and exits shall be painted on walls or indicated with illuminated signs.

E.    Remote exterior stairway doors shall be equipped with one-way locks allowing people to exit but not to enter the facility at those locations.

F.    Pedestrian entrances shall be concentrated to bring all pedestrians through one (1) portal, which improves the ability to see and be seen by others.

G.    Any ground-level pedestrian exits that open into nonsecure areas shall be emergency exits only and fitted with self-locking doors.

H.    Active security measures such as emergency phones and closed circuit television (CCTV) are recommended.

I.    Fencing shall not be used unless security dictates. If necessary, a six (6) foot high black-coated chain link fence is recommended. Openings in the fence should be located carefully, with only a minimum number of openings allowing cars and pedestrians to enter and leave.

J.    Landscape plantings shall not be located within three (3) feet of the interior curbing of the perimeter of the parking lot. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.28.040 Illuminance Standards

A.    Lighting shall be positioned to illuminate both horizontally and vertically. Illumination must reach into the edges of the parking stalls rather than just the driving aisles to minimize dark hiding places between cars.

B.    To minimize glare, lights shall be positioned between parked vehicles rather than in the center of drive aisles.

C.    Cutoff luminaries shall be required on all lighting mounted higher than twelve (12) feet above the floor.

D.    Interior parking structure walls, beam faces and underside of floor slabs shall be stained or painted a light color, preferably white or light blue, to increase the general brightness in parking structures. Anti-graffiti coating added to walls should be considered.

E.    The illuminance requirements for parking structures shall be in accordance with the standards in Table 17.28.030a. The illuminance shall be measured, or calculated, on an unobstructed floor. The maximum and minimum values are maintained illuminance levels; this occurs just prior to lamp replacement and luminaire cleaning. Vertical illuminances of objects such as walls and columns shall be equal to the horizontal values given in Table 17.28.030a. These vertical values shall be for a location measured at a height of five (5) feet above the pavement.

TABLE 17.28.030a: Maintained Illuminance Values for Parking Garages

	 	Minimum Horizontal Illumination (footcandles)	Maximum/Minimum Horizontal Uniformity Ratio*    	Minimum Vertical Illumination (footcandles)    

	Basic	1.0	10:1	0.5

17.32.030 Street Lighting Standards

A.    If street lighting is installed, the general levels of illumination shall be consistent with the IESNA Handbook, Figure 22-8, and the average illumination level may not exceed those specified in the IESNA Handbook by more than 0.2 footcandles.

B.    The uniformity ratio shall not exceed that specified by the IESNA Handbook. If the street has a sidewalk on only one (1) side, the streetlights shall be located on the side of the street that the sidewalk is on. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.32.040 Street Lighting Fixtures

A.    All street lighting fixtures shall be “cut-off” fixtures as defined by IESNA. If necessary, as determined by CPTED review, fixtures shall include glare shields to minimize light directed to the rear of the fixtures or on to adjacent properties. The maximum mounting height of street lights is twenty (20) feet.

B.    If the design for an area suggests the use of street lighting fixtures of a particular “period” or architectural style, or existing historical fixtures are to be retained, then the non-cut-off fixtures may be used either as alternatives or supplements to street lighting described above.

1.    For fixtures that do not meet the “cut-off” criteria, the maximum initial lumens generated by each fixture shall not exceed two thousand (2,000) lumens. 

2.    Mounting heights of such fixtures shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet for new fixtures. Where historic fixtures are being retained and/or extended, mounting height shall be that of the existing fixtures. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)

1.    The maximum illumination on any vertical surface or angular roof shall not exceed five (5) footcandles.

2.    Lighting fixtures shall be shielded and directed onto the building facade. Lighting fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets, roads, or properties.

3.    Lighting fixtures mounted on the building and designed to “wash” the facade with light are recommended.

4.    To the extent practicable, lighting fixtures shall be directed downward (i.e., below the horizontal) rather than upward.

B.    Facades of buildings without symbolic or historical significance may be illuminated if approved by the City Manager or designee subject to the following criteria and meeting the performance standards contained in subsection (A) of this section.

1.    Lighting does not cast light and glare on adjacent properties and rights-of-way.

2.    The lighting is needed to ensure the safety of employees and/or customers. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.44.030 Landscape Lighting Standards

Landscaping may be illuminated if approved by the CPTED Section subject to the following criteria:

A.    The CPTED Section shall first approve the landscape lighting plan that presents the purpose and objective of the lighting.

B.    The landscape lighting plan shall show the location of all lighting fixtures and what landscaping will be illuminated.

C.    The plan shall demonstrate that installation will not generate excessive light levels, cause glare, or direct light beyond the landscaping into the night sky.

Chapter 17.52 INTERIOR SPACES

Sections: 

17.52.010    Application

17.52.020    Purpose

17.52.030    Interior Design Considerations


17.52.010 Application

This chapter is recommended to apply to new commercial, industrial, retail, and multi-family development. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.52.020 Purpose

This chapter establishes recommendations for interior design to minimize risk and opportunities for crime. The following design features are recommended to conform with CPTED standards: main entry and lobby areas, location of receptionist areas in relation to windows and points of access control, adjacent offices that would promote surveillance into the main entry and lobby areas, location of stairwells, hallways, elevators, rest rooms, pay phones and drinking fountains, patio or break areas, type of glazing, use of electronic monitoring devices and general floor plans. The design considerations and examples are for use by developers, architects, and planners. The design standards specified under SMC 17.20.030 are strongly recommended but not required. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.52.030 Interior Design Considerations

A.    Avoid isolating an individual entrance at the end of a hall or head of stairs. 

B.    Reduce the number of rooms sharing a common hallway.

C.    Place windows in doors of stair landings. 

D.    Place restrooms in central areas.

E.    Refrain from placing restrooms near stairs or exterior doors.

F.    Position lounge and common areas to provide direct line of sight to hallways. 

G.    Use windows in blank walls.

H.    Create minor obstacles or passage points to prevent easy movement from very public areas to private areas.

I.    Place windows overlooking entrances.

J.    Restrooms provided in a parking facility shall have maze-type entrances instead of outer/inner doors that could trap a victim. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


Chapter 17.56 LANDSCAPING

Sections: 

17.56.010    Purpose

17.56.020    Location, Height, and Plant Standards


17.56.010 Purpose

The positioning, location, type of plant material, screening, and other landscape elements should allow for natural surveillance from within buildings, from outdoor locations on the site, from adjacent buildings and from the public rights-of-way. Landscaping and screening should complement efforts to define public, semi-public, and private areas. Natural access control can be achieved by emphasizing natural strategies that integrate behavior management through the design of space and the choice of plant materials. Dense plantings of thorny plant materials can provide a formidable barrier which is difficult to penetrate. Security is enhanced when walkways, entrances to buildings, and exits from buildings are open and permit a view to and from the surrounding neighborhood and adjacent sites. The more open the view of a space is, the less likely that space will be used for the commission of a crime. (Ord. 03-1033 § 11)


17.56.020 Location, Height, and Plant Standards

A.    Windows.

1.    Plants (trees, shrubs, etc.) shall be no higher than sill height within five (5) feet in front of windows, except for street trees located within the City’s designated City Center.

2.    Trees shall not be placed within five (5) feet in front of windows except where required for facade landscaping under SMC 15.445.100.

3.    It is recommended that barrier plants be placed below and to the sides of windows, except within six (6) feet of a walkway or children’s play area.

B.    Doorways/Entrances.

1.    No plants or trees shall be higher than three (3) feet within six (6) feet of a doorway or entrance.

C.    Walkways.

1.    Unless otherwise specified under Chapter 15.445 SMC, only low groundcover plants less than three (3) feet high shall be used within six (6) feet of walkways.

2.    Trees may be permitted in this area; provided, that they are pruned up to five (5) feet above the ground.

3.    Plants that exceed three (3) feet that have stalks less than two (2) inches in diameter and still allow for visual surveillance may also be used in this area.

4.    Walkway standards apply; provided, that the walkway is not adjacent to a building facade that requires facade landscaping.

D.    Barrier Plants.

1.    Barrier plants should be used below and to the sides of windows and adjacent perimeter walls, fences, and other building walls where desirable.

2.    Barrier plants discourage pedestrian through-traffic, therefore some types of barrier plants may exceed three (3) feet and still be approved.

E.    Trees. Trees are required to be pruned from the ground up to a height of five (5) feet to provide for visibility and surveillance, with the following exceptions:

1.    Deciduous trees fifteen (15) feet or less in height.

2.    Conifers (evergreens) twenty (20) feet or less in height. (Ord. 16-1007 § 33; Ord. 03-1033 § 11)

Article I. Introduction


18.05.010 History and Requirements of the Shoreline Management Act

A.    Washington’s Shoreline Management Act (Act) was adopted by the public in a 1972 referendum “to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the state’s shorelines.” The Act has three (3) broad policies:

1.    Encourage water-dependent uses: “uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment, or are unique to or dependent upon use of the state’s shorelines...”

2.    Protect shoreline natural resources, including “...the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the water of the state and their aquatic life...”

3.    Promote public access: “the public’s opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the state shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state and the people generally.”

B.    This Act recognizes that “shorelines are among the most valuable and fragile” of the State’s resources. The Act, and the City of SeaTac, recognize and protect private property rights along the shoreline, while aiming to preserve the quality of this unique resource for all State residents.

C.    The primary purpose of the Act is to provide for the management and protection of the State’s shoreline resources by planning for reasonable and appropriate uses. In order to protect the public interest in preserving these shorelines, the Act establishes a coordinated planning program between the State and local jurisdictions to use in addressing the types and effects of development occurring along the State’s shorelines. By law, the City is responsible for the following:

1.    Development of an inventory of the natural characteristics and land use patterns along shorelines covered by the Act.

2.    Preparation of a “master program” to determine the future of the shorelines.

3.    Development of a permit system to further the goals and policies of both the Act and the local master plan.

4.    Development of a restoration plan that includes goals, policies and actions for restoration of impaired shoreline ecological functions. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.1)) 


18.05.020 Master Program Development and Public Participation

The City of SeaTac (City) obtained a grant from the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) in 2007 to conduct a comprehensive Shoreline Master Program (SMP) update. The first step of the update process was to inventory the City’s shorelines as defined by the State’s Shoreline Management Act (SMA) (Chapter 90.58 RCW). Angle Lake is the only SMA shoreline in the City of SeaTac. The inventory describes existing biological and physical conditions. These conditions were then analyzed and characterized to create a baseline from which future development actions in the shoreline will be measured.

Environmental designations were identified for the different shoreline reaches and goals, policies, and regulations for each were developed.

The Guidelines require that the City demonstrate that its updated SMP yields “no net loss” in shoreline ecological functions relative to the baseline due to its implementation. Ideally, the SMP in combination with other City and regional efforts will ultimately produce a net improvement in shoreline ecological functions.

The City obtained a second grant from Ecology in 2018 to complete a periodic SMP update. Washington State law requires jurisdictions to review and update their SMPs every eight (8) years in accordance with the Shoreline Management Act (SMA) and its current guidelines and legislative rules to attain State approval. The periodic update to this SMP focused on reviewing relevant legislative updates since the comprehensive update and incorporating any applicable amendments and ensuring consistency with the City’s 2017 Comprehensive Plan Update and other City regulations. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.2)) 


18.05.030 Purposes of the Shoreline Master Program

The purposes of this Master Program are:

A.    To carry out the responsibilities imposed on the City of SeaTac by the Washington State Shoreline Management Act (Chapter 90.58 RCW).

B.    To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, by providing a guide and regulation for the future development of the shoreline resources of the City of SeaTac.

C.    To further, by adoption, the policies of Chapter 90.58 RCW, and the goals of this Master Program, both of which hereafter follow.

D.    To comply with the Shoreline Master Program Guidelines (Chapter 173-26 WAC), including a particular focus on including regulations and mitigation standards to ensure that development under the Shoreline Master Program will not cause a net loss of ecological functions. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.3)) 


18.05.040 Legislative Findings and Washington Shoreline Management Policies

The Washington State Legislature finds the shorelines of the State are among the most valuable and fragile of its natural resources and there is great concern throughout the State relating to their utilization, protection, restoration, and preservation. In addition, it finds that ever increasing pressures of additional uses are being placed on the shorelines, necessitating increased coordination in the management and development of the shorelines of the State. The Legislature further finds that much of the shorelines of the State and uplands adjacent thereto are in private ownership and that unrestricted construction on the privately owned or publicly owned shorelines of the State is not in the best public interest; therefore, coordinated planning is necessary in order to protect the public interest associated with the shorelines of the State while, at the same time, recognizing and protecting private property rights consistent with the public interest. There is, therefore, a clear and urgent demand for a planned, rational, and concerted effort, jointly performed by Federal, State, and local governments, to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the State’s shorelines.

It is the policy of the State to provide for the management of the shorelines of the State by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses. This policy is designed to ensure the development of these shorelines in a manner which, while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in navigable water, will promote and enhance the public interest. This policy is intended to protect against adverse effects to the public health, the land and its vegetation and wildlife, and the water of the State and its aquatic life, while generally protecting public rights of navigation and its associated activities. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.4)) 


18.05.050 Shoreline Master Program Basics

The SeaTac Shoreline Master Program is a planning document that outlines goals and policies for the shoreline of the City and establishes regulations for development occurring in that area.

In order to preserve and enhance the shoreline of SeaTac it is important that all development proposals relating to the shoreline area be evaluated in terms of the City’s Shoreline Master Program, and that the City Shoreline Administrator be consulted. Some developments may be exempt from regulation, while others may need to stay within established guidelines, or may require a conditional use permit application or variance application; all proposals must comply with the policies and regulations established by the State Shoreline Management Act as expressed through this local Shoreline Master Program adopted by the City of SeaTac.

The Shoreline Management Act defines for local jurisdictions the content and goals that should be represented in the shoreline master programs developed by each community; within these guidelines, it is left to each community to develop the specific regulations appropriate to that community. Under the Act, all shorelines of the State meeting the criteria established receive a given shoreline environmental designation. The purpose of the shoreline designation system is to ensure that all land use, development, or other activity occurring within the designated shoreline jurisdiction is appropriate for that area and provides consideration for the special requirements of that environment. SeaTac has designated its Angle Lake shorelines under five (5) shoreline environments: Aquatic, Urban Conservancy, Shoreline Residential, Medium-Intensity, and High-Intensity. These environments are described in Article V of this chapter, Shoreline Environments.

Persons proposing any shoreline development, land use, or other projects in the shoreline area must consult with the City of SeaTac Shoreline Master Program Administrator (the City of SeaTac’s Community and Economic Development Director) to determine how the proposal is addressed in the Master Program.

The City’s Shoreline Administrator will determine if a proposal is exempt from a shoreline substantial development permit (i.e., qualifies for a shoreline exemption), as well as provide information on the permit application process.

Requests for variances, conditional use permits, and substantial development permits require review and recommendation by the City’s Shoreline Administrator, with the decision by the Hearing Examiner. Requests for conditional uses and variances also require final approval by the State of Washington Department of Ecology. A description of exempt projects, shoreline application procedures and criteria are discussed in Article VIII of this chapter, Administration.

A description and map of the area within the jurisdiction of this Shoreline Master Program are presented in Article V of this chapter, Shoreline Environments. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.5)) 


18.05.060 Organization of This Shoreline Master Program

This Master Program is divided into eight (8) articles:

A.    Article I, Introduction, provides general background information on the State Shoreline Management Act; the development of the Shoreline Master Program in SeaTac; and a general discussion of when and how a shoreline master program is used.

B.    Article II, Definitions and Acronyms, defines terms found in this chapter.

C.    Article III, Goals of the Shoreline Management Program, lists the general goals and policies which guide the more detailed policies and regulations found in the individual sections of the SeaTac Shoreline Master Program.

D.    Article IV, General Shoreline Provisions, sets forth the general policies and regulations that apply to uses, developments, and activities in all shoreline areas of SeaTac.

E.    Article V, Shoreline Environments, defines and maps the shoreline jurisdiction in the City of SeaTac and defines and maps the environment designations of all the shorelines of the State in the City of SeaTac. Policies and regulations specific to the five (5) designated shoreline environments (Urban Conservancy, Shoreline Residential, Medium-Intensity, High-Intensity, and Aquatic) are detailed in this article. Specific setback regulations, reduction incentives and dimensional and density standards for all shoreline environments are also detailed in this article.

F.    Article VI, Shoreline Use Provisions, sets forth policies and regulations governing specific categories of uses and activities typically found in shoreline areas. The policies and regulations cover the following uses and activities: agriculture, aquaculture, commercial development (primary and accessory), industrial development, mining, parking (as a primary use), recreational facilities, residential development, scientific, historical, cultural, or educational uses, signage, transportation, and utilities (primary and accessory).

G.    Article VII, Shoreline Modification Provisions, provides policies and regulations for those activities that modify the physical configuration or qualities of the shoreline area.

H.    Article VIII, Administration, provides the system by which the SeaTac Shoreline Master Program will be administered, and provides specific information on the application process and criteria used in evaluating requests for shoreline substantial development permits, conditional use permits, and variances. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.6)) 


18.05.070 Relationship of This Shoreline Master Program to Other Plans

The permitting process for a shoreline development or use does not exempt an applicant from complying with any other local, State, regional or Federal statutes or regulations which may also be applicable to such development or use. In SeaTac, other plans and policy documents that must be considered include the SeaTac Comprehensive Plan and the adopted Surface Water Design Manual.

Proposals must also comply with the regulations developed by the City to implement its plans, such as the zoning code, as well as regulations relating to building construction and safety.

At the time of a permit application or of an initial inquiry, the City’s Shoreline Administrator should inform the applicant of those regulations and statutes which may be applicable to the best of the Administrator’s knowledge; provided, that the final responsibility for complying with such other statutes and regulations shall rest with the applicant. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 1.7))

State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). SEPA requires State agencies, local governments and other lead agencies to consider environmental factors when making most types of permit decisions, especially for development proposals of a significant scale. As part of the SEPA process, EISs may be required to be prepared and public comments solicited.

“Stream” means a naturally occurring body of periodic or continuously flowing water where: (1) the mean annual flow is greater than twenty (20) cubic feet per second and (2) the water is contained within a channel (WAC 173-22-030(8)).

“Structure” means a permanent or temporary edifice or building, or any piece of work artificially built or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner, whether installed on, above or below the surface of the ground or water, except for vessels (WAC 173-27-030(15)).

“Substantial development” means any development of which the total cost or fair market value exceeds seven thousand forty-seven dollars ($7,047), or any development which materially interferes with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the State. The dollar threshold established in this definition must be adjusted for inflation by the Office of Financial Management every five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2007, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. “Consumer price index” means, for any calendar year, that year’s annual average consumer price index, Seattle, Washington area, for urban wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, United States Department of Labor. The Office of Financial Management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the Office of the Code Reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one (1) month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect (RCW 90.58.030(3)(e)). For purposes of determining whether or not a permit is required, the total cost or fair market value shall be based on the value of development that is occurring on shorelines of the State as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(c). The total cost or fair market value of the development shall include the fair market value of any donated, contributed or found labor, equipment or materials. A list of activities and developments that shall not be considered substantial development is provided in Article VIII of this chapter (WAC 173-27-040(2)(a)).

“Vegetated LID BMPs” means LID BMPs that utilize landscaping.

“Water-dependent use” means a use or a portion of a use which cannot exist in any other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature of its operations. Examples of water-dependent uses may include moorage structures (including those associated with residential properties), ship cargo terminal loading areas, ferry and passenger terminals, barge loading facilities, ship building and dry docking, marinas, aquaculture, float plane facilities and sewer outfalls.

“Water-enjoyment use” means a recreational use or other use that facilitates public access to the shoreline as a primary characteristic of the use; or a use that provides for recreational use or aesthetic enjoyment of the shoreline for a substantial number of people as a general characteristic of the use and which through location, design, and operation ensures the public’s ability to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of the shoreline. In order to qualify as a water-enjoyment use, the use must be open to the general public and the shoreline-oriented space within the project must be devoted to the specific aspects of the use that fosters shoreline enjoyment.

“Water-oriented use” refers to any combination of water-dependent, water-related, and/or water-enjoyment uses and serves as an all-encompassing definition for priority uses under the SMA. “Non-water-oriented” serves to describe those uses which have little or no relationship to the shoreline and are not considered priority uses under the SMA. Examples include professional offices, automobile sales or repair shops, mini-storage facilities, multi-family residential development, department stores and gas stations.

“Water quality” means the physical characteristics of water within shoreline jurisdiction, including water quantity, hydrological, physical, chemical, aesthetic, recreation-related, and biological characteristics. Where used in this chapter, the term “water quantity” refers only to development and uses regulated under this chapter and affecting water quantity, such as impermeable surfaces and stormwater handling practices. Water quantity, for purposes of this chapter, does not mean the withdrawal of ground water or diversion of surface water pursuant to RCW 90.03.250 through 90.03.340.

“Water-related use” means a use or a portion of a use which is not intrinsically dependent on a waterfront location but whose economic viability is dependent upon a waterfront location because:

1.    Of a functional requirement for a waterfront location such as the arrival or shipment of materials by water or the need for large quantities of water; or

2.    The use provides a necessary service supportive of the water-dependent commercial activities and the proximity of the use to its customers makes its services less expensive and/or more convenient. Examples include manufacturers of ship parts large enough that transportation becomes a significant factor in the product’s cost, professional services serving primarily water-dependent activities and storage of water-transported foods. Examples of water-related uses may include warehousing of goods transported by water, seafood processing plants, hydroelectric generating plants, gravel storage when transported by barge, oil refineries where transport is by tanker and log storage.

“Watershed restoration plan” means a plan developed or sponsored by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Ecology, and/or the Department of Transportation acting within or pursuant to its authority, a city, a county or a conservation district that provides a general program and implementation measures or actions for the preservation, restoration, re-creation, or enhancement of the natural resources, character, and ecology of a stream, stream segment, drainage area, or watershed for which agency and public review has been conducted pursuant to Chapter 43.21C RCW, the State Environmental Policy Act.

“Wetlands” or “wetland areas” means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland areas to mitigate the conversion of wetlands.

“Zoning” means to designate by ordinance, including maps, areas of land reserved and regulated for specific land uses. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A Ch. 2))

Article III. Goals of the Shoreline Management Program 


18.05.110 Introduction

This article contains goals and policies that form the foundation of the City of SeaTac’s Shoreline Master Program. They apply to all areas and all designated shoreline environments within the shoreline jurisdiction of the City of SeaTac. The Shoreline Management Act requires cities to adopt goals, or “elements,” to guide and support major shoreline management issues. The elements required by RCW 90.58.100(2), when appropriate, are:

A.    Economic Development Element;

B.    Public Access Element;

C.    Recreational Element;

D.    Circulation Element;

E.    Shoreline Use Element;

F.    Conservation Element;

G.    Historic, Cultural, Scientific and Educational Element; and

H.    An element that gives consideration to the statewide interest in the prevention and minimization of flood damages. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.1)) 


18.05.120 Economic Development Element

The Shoreline Master Program for the City of SeaTac contains limited provisions for economic development along the shoreline of Angle Lake. Angle Lake is substantially developed with residential uses, with little undeveloped shoreline remaining. A small portion of the lake’s shoreline in the western corner allows a broader range of uses, including limited commercial uses. Angle Lake is a relatively small water body that does not have a navigable connection to other water bodies, so it is not regarded as a commercial transportation route. As such, access to the water is primarily related to recreation and residential uses and is not considered particularly important to commercial or industrial interests. There are three (3) parcels at the west end of the lake that have been developed for commercial use, as well as additional parcels where a mix of land uses, including some commercial use, is allowed under existing zoning. In particular, there are two (2) vacant parcels at the west end of the City that are expected to be developed at some point in the future.

	Goal ED-1.	Ensure that any economic activity taking place along the shoreline operates without harming the site’s environmental quality or adjacent shorelands and that new non-residential development provides public access to the shoreline for water-enjoyment activities.

	Objective ED-1.	Require proposed economic use of the shoreline to be consistent with SeaTac’s Comprehensive Plan. Require upland uses on adjacent lands outside of immediate SMA jurisdiction (in accordance with RCW 90.58.340) to be consistent with the purpose and intent of this Master Program as they affect the shoreline.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.2))


18.05.130 Public Access Element

	Goal PA-1.	Increase the amount and diversity of public access to the shoreline, including trails, viewing platforms, and improved piers, and preserve and enhance views of the shoreline, consistent with the natural shoreline character, private rights and public safety.

	Objective PA-1.	Provide and enhance shoreline access to Angle Lake through purchase or retention of access easements, signage of public access points, and designation and design of specific shoreline access areas for wildlife viewing. Integrate public access to shorelines as a part of the City’s public trail system; priorities for public access trails include connecting tax parcel 042204-9009 with Angle Lake Park. Ensure new public access does not adversely affect the integrity and character of the shoreline or threaten fragile shoreline ecosystems by locating new access points on the least sensitive portion of the site.

	Objective PA-2.	Ensure the development of upland areas such as parking facilities and play areas, as well as the development of in-water and nearshore structures, such as docks and swimming areas, are located and designed in ways that result in no net loss of ecological function.

	Objective PA-3.	Access should be provided for a range of users including pedestrians, bicyclists, boaters and people with disabilities to the greatest extent feasible.

	Objective PA-4.	Development, uses and activities on or near the shoreline should not impair or detract from the public’s visual or physical access to the water.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.3))


18.05.140 Recreational Element

	Goal REC-1.	Encourage diverse, water-oriented recreational opportunities in those shoreline areas that can reasonably tolerate such uses without destroying the integrity and character of the shoreline.

	Objective REC-1.	Maintain and enhance existing shoreline recreation assets at Angle Lake Park, including the existing pier and boat launch.

	Objective REC-2.	Pursue additional public access to the shoreline for recreational uses, particularly for trails and passive recreation. Explore opportunities to develop trail links within and between public properties.

	Objective REC-3.	Ensure existing and proposed recreational uses are of a safe and healthy nature and do not adversely affect the integrity and character of the shoreline, or threaten fragile shoreline ecosystems.

	Objective REC-4.	Consider active and passive recreational needs in development of public shoreline access areas.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.4))


18.05.150	Circulation Element

	Goal CIRC-1.	Maintain safe, reasonable and adequate vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation systems to shorelines and ensure that these routes will have the least possible adverse effect on unique or fragile shoreline features and existing ecological systems, while contributing to the functional and visual enhancement of the shoreline.

	Objective CIRC-1.	Locate land circulation systems as far from the land-water interface as feasible to reduce interference with either natural shoreline resources or other appropriate shoreline uses, except when necessary to provide for appropriate public access to the shoreline. Where possible avoid creating barriers between adjacent uplands and the shoreline.

	Objective CIRC-2.	Improve access to Angle Lake through expanded non-motorized connections and transit service.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.5))


18.05.160 Conservation Element

	Goal CONS-1.	Preserve, protect, and restore to the greatest extent feasible the natural resources of the shoreline, including but not limited to scenic vistas, aesthetics, and vital riparian areas for wildlife protection.

	Objective CONS-1.	Protect shoreline process and ecological functions through regulatory and non-regulatory means that may include acquisition of key properties, conservation easements, regulation of development within the shoreline jurisdiction, and incentives to encourage ecologically sound design.

	Objective CONS-2.	Reclaim and restore areas which are biologically and aesthetically degraded to the greatest extent feasible while maintaining appropriate use of the shoreline.

	Objective CONS-3.	Preserve the scenic aesthetic quality of shoreline areas and vistas to the greatest extent feasible.

	Objective CONS-4.	Preserve and restore native vegetation along the shoreline to the greatest extent feasible.

	Objective CONS-5.	Target Angle Lake Park for restoration of shoreline natural resources and functions while ensuring continued public access to the shoreline.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.6))


18.05.170 Shoreline Use Element

	Goal SU-1.	Ensure that the land use patterns within shoreline areas are compatible with shoreline environment designations and will be sensitive to and not degrade habitat and ecological systems and other shoreline resources.

	Objective SU-1.	When determining allowable uses and resolving use conflicts within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction, apply the following preferences and priorities in the order listed below:

	Objective SU-2.	Reserve appropriate areas for protecting and restoring ecological functions to control pollution and prevent damage to the natural environment and public health.

	Objective SU-3.	Reserve shoreline areas for water-dependent and associated water-related uses.

	Objective SU-4.	Reserve shoreline areas for other water-related and water-enjoyment uses that are compatible with ecological protection and restoration objectives.

	Objective SU-5.	Locate single-family residential uses where they are appropriate and can be developed without significant impact to ecological functions or displacement of water-dependent uses.

	Objective SU-6.	Limit non-water-oriented uses to those locations where the above described uses are inappropriate or where non-water-oriented uses demonstrably contribute to the objectives of the Shoreline Management Act, including opportunities for ecological enhancements and public access improvements.

	Objective SU-7.	New residential development should be designed to protect existing shoreline water views.

	Objective SU-8.	Only allow development and redevelopment activities within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction that are designed to ensure public safety, enhance public access, protect existing shoreline and water views and achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

	Objective SU-9.	Encourage and in some cases require the use of low impact development (LID) and green building practices, such as those promulgated under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Green Built programs, for new development within the shoreline jurisdiction.

	Objective SU-10.	Do not allow proposed shoreline uses to infringe upon the rights of others or upon the rights of private ownership.

	Objective SU-11.	Encourage shoreline uses which enhance their specific areas or employ innovative features for purposes consistent with this Program.

	Objective SU-12.	Encourage restoration of shoreline areas that have been degraded or diminished in ecological value and function as a result of past activities or catastrophic events.

	Objective HCSE-1.	Prevent the destruction of or damage to any site having historic, cultural, scientific, or educational value.

	Objective HCSE-2.	Ensure that new development is compatible with existing historic structures and cultural areas.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 3.8)) 

Article IV. General Shoreline Provisions 


18.05.190 Introduction

A.    Based on the goals established for the Shoreline Master Program, the following general policies and regulations apply to all uses, developments, and activities in the shoreline area of the City of SeaTac. General policies and regulations are broken into different topic headings and arranged alphabetically. Each topic begins with a description of its applicability, followed by general policy statements and regulations. The intent of these provisions is to be inclusive, making them applicable to all environments, as well as particular shoreline uses and activities. Topics include the following:

1.    Archaeological and historic resources.

2.    Environmental impacts.

3.    Public access.

4.    Shoreline vegetation conservation.

5.    Water quality, stormwater, and non-point pollution.

B.    The regulations of this article are in addition to other adopted ordinances and rules. Where conflicts exist between regulations, those that provide more substantive protection to the shoreline area shall apply. These interlocking development regulations are intended to make shoreline development responsive to specific design needs and opportunities along the City’s shorelines, protect the public’s interest in the shorelines’ recreational and aesthetic values and assure, at a minimum, no net loss of ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources. This article does not include a discussion of environmentally sensitive areas, nor does the SMP include sensitive area regulations, as SeaTac’s 2008 Final Shoreline Analysis Report indicated that there are no known sensitive areas within shoreline jurisdiction.

C.    These provisions address the elements discussed in Article III of this chapter as required by RCW 90.58.100(2) and implement the governing principles of the Shoreline Master Program Guidelines as established in WAC 173-26-186. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 4.1)) 


18.05.200 Archaeological and Historic Resources

A.    Applicability. The following provisions apply to archaeological and historic resources that are either recorded at the State Historic Preservation Office and/or by local jurisdictions or have been inadvertently uncovered. Archaeological sites located both in and outside shoreline jurisdiction are subject to Chapter 27.44 RCW (Indian Graves and Records) and Chapter 27.53 RCW (Archaeological Sites and Records) and development or uses that may impact such sites shall comply with Chapter 25-48 WAC as well as the provisions of this article.

B.    Archaeological and Historic Resource Policies. Due to the limited and irreplaceable nature of archaeological and historic resources, prevent the destruction of or damage to any site having historic, cultural, scientific, or educational value as identified by the appropriate authorities, including affected Indian tribes, and the Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation.

C.    Archaeological and Historic Resource Regulations.

1.    Local developers and property owners shall immediately stop work and notify the City, the Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation and affected Native American tribes if archaeological resources are uncovered during excavation.

2.    A site inspection or evaluation by a professional archaeologist in coordination with affected Native American tribes shall be required for all permits issued in areas documented to contain archaeological resources. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be considered a violation of the shoreline permit.

3.    Significant archaeological and historic resources shall be permanently preserved for scientific study, education and public observation. When the City determines that a site has significant archeological, natural scientific or historical value, a shoreline substantial development permit and/or any other permit authorizing development or land modification shall not be issued which would pose a threat to the site. The City may require that a site be redesigned or that development be postponed in such areas to allow investigation of public acquisition potential and/or retrieval and preservation of significant artifacts.

4.    In the event that unforeseen factors constituting an emergency as defined in RCW 90.58.030 necessitate rapid action to retrieve or preserve artifacts or data identified above, the project may be exempted from the permit requirement of these regulations. The City shall notify the State Department of Ecology, the State Attorney General’s Office and the State Historic Preservation Office of such a waiver in a timely manner.

5.    Archaeological sites located both in and outside the shoreline jurisdiction are subject to Chapter 27.44 RCW (Indian Graves and Records) and Chapter 27.53 RCW (Archaeological Sites and Records) and shall comply with Chapter 25-48 WAC or its successor as well as the provisions of this Master Program.

6.    Identified historical or archaeological resources shall be considered in park, open space, public access, and site planning with access to such areas designed and managed to give maximum protection to the resource and surrounding environment.

7.    Clear interpretation of historical and archaeological features and natural areas shall be provided when appropriate. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 4.2)) 


18.05.210 Environmental Impacts

A.    Applicability. The Shoreline Management Act (Act) is concerned with the environmental impacts that both a use and activity may have on the fragile shorelines of the State. Problems of degrading the shoreline and its waters with contaminants such as petroleum products, chemicals, metals, nutrients, solid or human waste, or soil sediments from erosion are all issues that are addressed.

B.    Environmental Impact Policies.

1.    Adverse impacts on the natural environment should be minimized during all phases of development (e.g., design, construction, operation, and management).

2.    Shoreline developments that propose to enhance environmentally sensitive areas, other natural characteristics, resources of the shoreline, and provide public access and recreational opportunities to the shoreline are consistent with the fundamental goals of this Master Program, and should be encouraged.

C.    Environmental Impact Regulations.

1.    All shoreline uses and developments shall be located, designed, constructed and mitigated to result in no net loss of ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural processes.

2.    Where required, mitigation measures shall be applied in the following sequence of steps listed in order of priority:

a.    Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

b.    Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

c.    Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

d.    Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations;

e.    Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and

f.    Monitoring the impact and the compensation projects and taking appropriate corrective measures.

3.    Solid waste, liquid waste, and untreated effluent shall not be allowed to enter any bodies of water or to be discharged onto the land.

4.    The direct release of oil and hazardous materials or chemicals onto the land or into water is prohibited. Equipment for the transportation, storage, handling or application of such materials shall be maintained in a safe and leak proof condition. If there is evidence of leakage, the further use of such equipment shall be suspended until the deficiency has been satisfactorily corrected.

5.    All shoreline uses and activities shall utilize best management practices (BMPs) to minimize any increase in surface runoff and to control, treat and release surface water runoff so that receiving water quality and shore properties and features are not adversely affected. Low impact development (LID) BMPs, such as bioretention and permeable pavement, shall be utilized where feasible to strive to mimic pre-development hydrologic processes. All types of BMPs require regular maintenance to continue to function as intended. BMPs, including LID BMPs, are identified in the Surface Water Design Manual.

6.    All shoreline developments and uses shall utilize effective erosion control methods during both construction and operation. Erosion and sediment controls (ESC) shall be applied as specified by the temporary ESC measures and performance criteria and implementation requirements in Appendices C and D of the Surface Water Design Manual.

7.    All shoreline developments shall be located, constructed and operated so as not to be a hazard to public health and safety.

8.    Land clearing, grading, filling and alteration of natural drainage features and land forms shall be limited to the minimum necessary for development. These activities shall avoid maintenance problems and adverse impacts to adjacent properties or shoreline features, result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions, and minimize adverse impacts on native vegetation and soils to the extent practicable. When required by the Public Works Director, surface drainage systems or substantial earth modifications shall be designed by a civil engineer registered to practice in the State of Washington. The Director, or designee, may also require additional studies prepared by a qualified soils specialist.

9.    All shoreline uses and activities shall be located and designed to prevent or minimize the need for shoreline protection structures (bulkheading, riprap, etc.) and stabilization, landfills, groins, jetties, or substantial site regrades.

10.    Identified significant short-term, long-term, or cumulative adverse environmental impacts lacking appropriate mitigation that is likely to achieve no net loss of ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline processes shall be sufficient reason for permit denial. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 4.3)) 


18.05.220 Public Access

A.    Applicability. Public access includes the ability of the general public to reach, touch, and enjoy the water’s edge, to travel on the waters of the State, and to view the water and the shoreline from adjacent locations. There are a variety of types of potential public access, including picnic areas, pathways and trails, promenades, bridges, street ends, ingress and egress, parking and others.

Existing public access to shorelines within the shoreline jurisdiction is limited to Angle Lake Park situated on the northwestern side of the lake. The park has a boat launch, fishing pier, playground equipment, stage, picnic shelter, barbecue area, restrooms and open recreation areas. A private community park, Angle Lake Manor Beach Lot, is located along the north shore of the lake. There are also private recreation facilities associated with multi-family housing and the mobile home park at the western end of the lake. However, all three (3) of these facilities are private and are available to residents of those specific developments only. Other vacant properties located along the lake are located in single-family zones and the likelihood of public access to those sites is minimal.

B.    Public Access and Recreation Policies.

1.    Ensure development of tax parcel 042204-9009 includes public access and natural area preservation and enhancement along the waterfront.

2.    Consider increasing public access to Angle Lake through acquisition of lands and easements by purchase, lease, or gift. Specifically consider opportunities for acquisition of vacant residential parcels located along the northeastern shoreline just south of NE 188th Street and between the eastern shoreline and Military Road South.

3.    Coordinate with commercial property owners on the west side of Angle Lake to allow public access, in the form of a public trail, along the shoreline.

4.    Maintain and upgrade water-enjoyment recreational amenities at Angle Lake Park as funds become available, while reducing the overall impact these amenities have on the shoreline environment.

5.    Public access provisions should be required for all shoreline development and uses, except for a single-family residence or residential projects containing less than four (4) dwelling units.

6.    Regulate the design, construction, and operation of permitted uses in the shoreline jurisdiction to minimize, insofar as practical, interference with the public’s use of the water.

7.    Development uses and activities on or near the shoreline should not impair or detract from the public’s visual or physical access to the water.

8.    Preservation and enhancement of the public’s visual access to Angle Lake should be encouraged through the establishment of setbacks and height limits that ensure view corridors. Enhancement of views should not be construed to mean excess removal of vegetation that partially impairs views.

9.    Public access to Angle Lake does not include the right to enter upon or cross private property, except for dedicated easements.

10.    Shoreline areas that hold unique value for public enjoyment should be identified and retained, purchased or easements should be acquired for public use. Prioritize sites in terms of short- and long-term acquisition and development.

11.    Integrate shoreline public access trails with other existing and planned regional trails where feasible to provide non-motorized access and community connections.

12.    Physical access for swimming and non-motorized boating, passive recreation (such as interpretive trails) and habitat enhancement should be important objectives for the management of shoreline public access sites.

13.    Where appropriate, public access should be provided as close as possible to the water’s edge without adversely affecting a sensitive shoreline environment.

14.    Public access facilities should provide auxiliary facilities, such as parking and sanitation facilities, when appropriate, and should be designed for accessibility by handicapped and physically impaired persons; auxiliary facilities should be located outside of the shoreline management area where feasible or near the outer edge of the shoreline management area if possible.

15.    Public access should be designed to provide for public safety and to minimize potential impacts to private property and individual privacy.

16.    Public access to the shoreline should be sensitive to the unique characteristics of the shoreline and should preserve the natural character and quality of the environment.

17.    Regulations shall ensure that the development of active recreational facilities results in no net loss of ecological function. Regulations should address upland concerns, such as the location and design of parking facilities and active play areas, as well as the development on in-water and nearshore structures, such as non-motorized boat launches, piers and swimming areas.

18.    The level of public access should be commensurate with the degree of uniqueness or fragility of the shoreline.

19.    Public access facilities should be constructed of environmentally friendly materials, use low impact development techniques and support healthy natural processes, when feasible.

20.    Regulations should provide detailed guidance for the construction of trails in particularly environmentally sensitive shoreline segments along Angle Lake.

21.    Plan for an integrated shoreline public access system that identifies specific public needs and opportunities to provide public access. This planning should be integrated with other relevant Comprehensive Plan elements, especially transportation and parks/recreation. The planning process shall also comply with all relevant constitutional and other legal limitations that protect private property rights.

22.    At a minimum, public access planning should result in public access requirements for shoreline permits, recommended projects, and/or actions to be taken to develop access to shorelines on public property. Planning should identify a variety of shoreline circulation and access opportunities for pedestrians (including disabled persons), bicycles, and vehicles between shoreline access points, consistent with other Comprehensive Plan elements.

C.    Public Access and Recreation Regulations.

1.    Public access shall be required for all shoreline development and uses, except for a single-family residence or residential projects containing less than four (4) dwelling units.

2.    Public access requirements shall be applied as follows:

a.    A shoreline development or use that does not provide public access may be authorized provided it is demonstrated by the applicant and determined by the City that one (1) or more of the following provisions apply:

i.    Unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public exist which cannot be prevented by any practical means;

ii.    Inherent security requirements of the proposed development or use cannot be satisfied through the application of alternative design features or other solutions;

iii.    The cost of providing the access, easement, or an alternative amenity is unreasonably disproportionate to the total long-term cost of the proposed development;

iv.    Unacceptable environmental harm will result from the public access which cannot be mitigated; or

v.    Significant undue and unavoidable conflict between the proposed access and adjacent uses would occur and cannot be mitigated.

b.    Provided further, that the applicant has first demonstrated and the City has determined that all reasonable alternatives have been exhausted, including but not limited to:

i.    Regulating access by such means as limiting hours of use to daylight hours.

ii.    Designing separation of uses and activities, with such means as fences, terracing, hedges, native and drought tolerant landscaping, and vegetated LID BMPs.

iii.    Providing access that is physically separated from the proposal, such as a nearby street end, an off-site viewpoint, or a trail system.

c.    Where the above conditions cannot be met, a payment in lieu of providing public access shall be required in accordance with RCW 82.02.020.

3.    Developments, uses, and activities shall be designed and operated to avoid blocking, reducing, or adversely interfering with the public’s visual or physical access to the water and the shorelines. In providing visual access to the shoreline, natural vegetation shall not be excessively removed either by clearing or by topping.

4.    Public access sites shall be connected directly to the nearest public street through a parcel boundary, tract, or easement.

5.    Public access sites shall be made barrier free for the physically disabled where feasible.

18.05.230 Restoration

Restoration refers to the reestablishment or upgrading of impaired ecological shoreline processes or functions. The following goals and policies are intended to guide actions that are designed to achieve improvements in shoreline ecological functions over time in those areas of Angle Lake where they have been degraded. The overarching purpose is to achieve overall improvements over time when compared to the condition upon adoption of the Master Program, as detailed in the Shoreline Analysis Report. Restoration is distinct from mitigation measures necessary to achieve no net loss of shoreline functions and the City’s commitment to plan for restoration will not be implemented through regulatory means.

A.    General Restoration Goals.

	Goal REST-1.	Maintain, restore or enhance watershed processes, including sediment, water, wood, light and nutrient delivery, movement and loss.

	Goal REST-2.	Maintain or enhance fish and wildlife habitat during all life stages and where possible maintain functional corridors linking these habitats.

	Goal REST-3.	Continue to improve water quality on public and private property through implementation of the NPDES Phase II requirements and other efforts.

B.    System-Wide Restoration Objectives.

	Objective REST-1.	Improve the water quality of Angle Lake by managing the quality and quantity of stormwater in contributing systems, consistent at a minimum with the latest Washington Department of Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington.

	Objective REST-2.	Increase quality, width and diversity of native vegetation in protected corridors adjacent to lake habitats to provide safe migration pathways for fish and wildlife, food, nest sites, shade, perches, and organic debris. Strive to control non-indigenous plants or weeds that are proven harmful to native vegetation or habitats.

	Objective REST-3.	Continue to work collaboratively with other jurisdictions and stakeholders to implement the WRIA 9 Plan.

	Objective REST-4.	Seek funding where possible for various restoration actions and programs from local sources and by working with other WRIA 9 jurisdictions and stakeholders to seek Federal, State, grant and other funding opportunities.

	Objective REST-5.	Develop a public education plan to inform private property owners in the shoreline zone and in the remainder of the City about the effects of land management practices and other unregulated activities (such as vegetation removal, pesticide/herbicide use, car washing) on fish and wildlife habitats.

	Objective REST-6.	Where feasible, protect, enhance, and encourage the restoration of lake areas and wetlands throughout the contributing basin where functions have been lost or compromised.

C.    Angle Lake Restoration Objectives.

	Objective ALREST-1.	Improve the health of lake shorelines by removing bulkheads and replacing these features to the extent feasible with bioengineered stabilization solutions to improve aquatic habitat conditions.

	Objective ALREST-2.	Target Angle Lake Park for habitat enhancements that are designed and sited to be compatible with the heavy active recreation use at this park. Opportunities include removing the bulkhead and providing bioengineered shoreline stabilization, removal of excess impervious surface, consolidation of the viewing platform and replaced pier structure, improved drainage using infiltration and planting of native vegetation where appropriate.

	Objective ALREST-3.	Improve habitat conditions by increasing large woody debris recruitment potential through plantings of trees along the lake shore, particularly conifers. Where feasible, install or encourage the installation of large woody debris to meet short-term needs.

	Objective ALREST-4.	Target single-family residential properties with incentives, outreach and information for homeowners who are willing to voluntarily remove bulkheads, plant native vegetation and encourage large woody debris recruitment.

	Objective ALREST-5.	Decrease the amount and impact of overwater and in-water structures along Angle Lake through minimization of structure size and use of more environmentally friendly materials, including grated decking.

	Objective ALREST-6.	Target Angle Lake Park for the use of environmentally friendly materials and design during the future replacement of the pier at this site.

	Objective ALREST-7.	Continue to participate in lake-wide efforts at Angle Lake to reduce populations of non-native aquatic vegetation.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 4.5)) 


18.05.240 Vegetation Conservation (Clearing and Grading)

Vegetation within and adjacent to water bodies provides a valuable function for the health of aquatic ecosystems. Vegetation management involves both a passive and active management system. The intent of both systems is to minimize habitat loss and the impact of invasive plants, erosion, sedimentation and flooding. “Passive” vegetation management deals with protection and enhancement of existing diverse native plant communities along all shorelines. “Active” vegetation management involves aquatic weed control as well as the restoration of altered or threatened shorelines using a technology called soil bioengineering. Soil bioengineering reestablishes native plant communities as a dynamic system that stabilizes the land from the effects of erosion.

A.    Applicability. Clearing and grading is the activity associated with developing property for a particular use including commercial, industrial, recreational, and residential. Specifically, “clearing” means the destruction or removal of vegetative ground cover and/or trees including, but not limited to, root material removal and/or topsoil removal. “Grading” means any excavating, filling, removing the duff layer, or combination thereof. Grading can also involve either the export of materials off site, or the import of materials from an off-site source. Both of these activities may cause erosion, siltation, increased runoff and flood volumes, reduced flood storage capacity, and habitat damage.

Vegetation conservation includes activities to protect and restore vegetation along or near freshwater shorelines that contribute to the ecological functions of shoreline areas. Vegetation conservation provisions include the prevention or restriction of plant clearing and earth grading, vegetation restoration, and the control of invasive weeds and nonnative species.

As with all master program provisions, vegetation management provisions apply even to those shorelines and uses which are exempt from a permit requirement. Like other master program provisions, vegetation conservation standards do not apply retroactively to existing uses and structures, such as existing agricultural practices or the regular maintenance of existing ornamental residential landscapes.

B.    Shoreline Vegetation Conservation Policies.

1.    All clearing and grading activities should be designed and conducted to minimize impacts to wildlife habitat, minimize sedimentation of lakes, and to minimize degradation of water quality.

2.    Clearing and grading activities in shoreline areas should be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate shoreline development. Such activities should be discouraged in designated (structural) setback areas and allowed in other shoreline locations only when associated with a permitted shoreline development.

3.    Adverse environmental and shoreline impacts of clearing and grading should be avoided wherever possible through proper site planning, construction timing and practices, bank stabilization, soil bioengineering and use of erosion and drainage control methods. Maintenance of drainage controls should be a high priority to ensure continuing, effective protection of habitat and water quality.

4.    Cleared and disturbed sites remaining after completion of construction should be promptly replanted with native vegetation or with other species as approved by the City.

5.    All clearing and grading activities should be designed with the objective of maintaining natural diversity in vegetation species, age, and cover density.

6.    For proposed land clearing, landfill, or grading activities that require a grading permit under the SeaTac Municipal Code, a clearing and grading plan addressing species removal, replanting, irrigation, erosion and sedimentation control and other methods of shoreline protection shall be required.

7.    Conserve existing native vegetation around Angle Lake to maintain and enhance: water and sediment storage, removal of excess nutrients and toxic compounds, recruitment of large woody debris, bank stability, shade, and recruitment of organic matter.

8.    Emphasize retention of native shoreline vegetation when reviewing plans for future development and encourage replanting and enhancement of shoreline vegetation when absent to reestablish and upgrade impaired ecological shoreline processes and functions.

9.    Provide incentives for the retention and planting of native vegetation, particularly in areas recommended for designation as Shoreline Residential. Incentives could include additional flexibility with building setbacks from Angle Lake, a simplified permit process with recommended planting plans, reduced or waiver of permit fees, and/or City participation in a pilot project that promotes shoreline restoration.

10.    The City should explore opportunities for the planting and enhancement of native vegetation at Angle Lake Park.

11.    Vegetation removal on tax parcel 042204-9009 should be carefully managed and mitigation plantings should be provided to ensure no net loss of ecological function. Within the Urban Conservancy portions of this property the primary goal should be to maintain and enhance the forest ecology to the maximum extent while providing public access.

12.    In order to increase habitat and address other ecological functions within the shoreline environment such as wave attenuation, temperature regulation, and bank stabilization, encourage homeowners and property managers to leave diseased and fallen trees in place along the shoreline edge provided the trees are not a danger to public safety or private property.

13.    Use soil bioengineering techniques when restoring degraded shorelines, wherever feasible, to minimize the processes of erosion, sedimentation, and flooding.

14.    Development of tax parcel 042204-9009 should include natural area preservation and enhancement in addition to public access along the waterfront.

15.    The removal of mature trees and native vegetation along Angle Lake should be regulated in a manner that provides greater protection than the current tree retention regulations (Chapter 15.445 SMC). In particular, removal of non-hazardous mature trees and native vegetation within the required setback of Angle Lake should be severely restricted.

16.    The City of SeaTac should provide information to the public about environmentally appropriate vegetation management, landscaping for shoreline properties and alternatives to the use of pesticides and herbicides which impact water quality and aquatic habitat.

17.    Property owners should use the following best management practices (BMPs) when maintaining residential landscapes:

a.    Avoid use of herbicides, fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides along drainage channels, and shores of Angle Lake, as well as in the water.

b.    Limit the amount of lawn and garden watering so that there is no surface runoff.

c.    Dispose of grass clippings, leaves, or twigs properly; do not sweep these materials into the street, into a body of water, or near a storm drain.

18.    Aquatic weed management should involve usage of native plant materials wherever possible in soil bioengineering applications and habitat restoration activities. Where active removal or destruction of aquatic vegetation is necessary, it should be done only to the extent necessary to allow water-dependent activities to continue. Removal or modification of aquatic vegetation should be conducted in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to native plant communities, and should include appropriate handling or disposal of weed materials and attached sediments.

19.    Monitor and control aquatic invasive species in Angle Lake to maintain eradication of water lily and prevent establishment of other aquatic invasive species.

20.    Discourage extensive lawns due to their limited erosion control value, limited water retention capacity, and associated chemical and fertilizer applications.

C.    Shoreline Vegetation Conservation Regulations.

1.    All clearing and grading activities must adhere to the requirements of the City’s code pertaining to land, clearing and grading (Chapter 13.190 SMC, Clearing and Grading Code), landscaping (Chapter 15.445 SMC, Landscaping and Tree Retention) and all additional requirements provided in the SMP. Additional clearing and grading performance standards may be required as a condition of permit issuance to ensure the proposal will result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

2.    Prior to issuance of any construction, grading, or building permits, a landscape bond or other suitable financial guarantee as approved by the City Attorney shall be submitted to the Department of Planning and Community Development. The amount of the landscape bond or other financial guarantee shall equal one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the estimated cost of the landscaping. This regulation would also apply to any site mitigation requirements.

3.    Prior to final issuance of a building permit, land use permit or occupancy, a maintenance bond or other acceptable financial guarantee equal to thirty percent (30%) of the replacement cost of the landscaping shall be submitted. The bond or other suitable financial guarantee shall be maintained for a three (3) year period, at which point the Building Official and the City Manager, or designee, will determine if the bond shall be released or extended to maintain landscaped areas. This regulation would also apply to any site mitigation requirements.

4.    In all shoreline areas, land clearing, grading, filling and alteration of natural drainage features and landforms shall be limited to the minimum necessary for development.

5.    Clearing and grading activities may only be allowed when associated with a permitted shoreline development.

6.    Any normal and routine maintenance of existing trees shall not be subject to these clearing and grading regulations; provided, that said maintenance does not involve removal of healthy trees and is not detrimental to the health of any trees.

7.    Any significant placement of materials from off site (other than surcharge or preload) or the substantial creation or raising of dry upland shall be considered fill and shall also comply with the fill provisions in Article VII of this chapter.

8.    Clearing and grading activities and related alteration of the natural landscape shall only be allowed in association with a permitted shoreline use or development with limited exceptions as set forth below:

a.    Removal of noxious weeds as listed by the State in Chapter 16-750 WAC, provided such activity shall be conducted in a manner consistent with best management practices and the City of SeaTac’s engineering and stormwater design standards, and native vegetation shall be promptly reestablished in the disturbed area.

b.    Pruning consistent with accepted arboricultural practices, maintenance of existing ornamental landscapes and other activities allowed pursuant to these regulations; provided, that said modification is conducted in a manner consistent with this Master Program and results in no net loss to ecological functions or critical fish and wildlife habitats.

c.    Maintenance or restoration of view corridors; provided, that said activity is conducted in a manner consistent with this Master Program and results in no net loss to ecological functions or critical fish and wildlife habitat areas.

9.    The City shall regulate tree removal and land clearing within the shoreline jurisdiction to protect ecological functions. The City shall require a report prepared by a qualified professional as part of any substantial development permit that includes tree removal and land clearing. The report shall identify appropriate mitigation, performance assurances and maintenance and monitoring requirements necessary to assure no net loss of ecological function necessary to sustain shoreline processes.

10.    Native understory vegetation and trees within the Urban Conservancy environment and within shoreline setback areas in all environments shall be retained, unless necessary to provide water access, to provide limited view corridors or to mitigate a hazard to life or property. Where limited removals are allowed pursuant to the conditions provided above, vegetation shall be replaced to assure no net loss is achieved.

11.    Within all other shoreline areas, tree removal shall be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate proposed structures and uses or to mitigate a hazard to life or property, and significant trees shall be replaced at an appropriate ratio to assure no net loss is achieved.

12.    Restoration of any shoreline that has been disturbed or degraded shall use native plant materials, unless such restoration occurs within a developed and maintained ornamental landscape, in which case noninvasive plant materials similar to that which most recently occurred on site may be used.

13.    Surfaces cleared of vegetation and not developed must be replanted with native species or other species as approved by the City within one (1) year. Replanted areas shall be planned and maintained such that, within three (3) years’ time, the vegetation is at least ninety percent (90%) reestablished.

14.    Stabilization of exposed erosion-prone surfaces within the shoreline environment shall, wherever feasible, utilize soil bioengineering techniques.

15.    Aquatic vegetation control shall only occur when native plant communities and associated habitats are threatened or where an existing water-dependent use is restricted by the presence of weeds. Aquatic vegetation control shall occur in compliance with all other applicable laws and standards, including Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements. Control of aquatic vegetation by mechanical methods is exempt from the requirement to obtain a shoreline substantial development permit only if the bottom sediment or benthos is not disturbed in the process. It is assumed that mechanical removal of accumulated vegetation at a level closer than two (2) feet to the root level will disturb the bottom sediment and benthos layer.

16.    The control of aquatic vegetation by derooting, rotovating or other methods which disturb the bottom sediment or benthos shall be considered development for which a shoreline substantial development permit is required.

17.    The application of herbicides or pesticides in Angle Lake, wetlands, or ditches requires a permit from the Washington Department of Ecology and may require preparation of a SEPA checklist for review by other agencies. The individual(s) involved must obtain a pesticide applicator license from the Washington State Department of Agriculture. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 4.6)) 


18.05.250 Water Quality, Stormwater, and Non-Point Pollution

A.    Applicability. Water quality is affected in numerous ways by human occupation and development of shoreline areas. Typically, the increase in impermeable surfaces as a result of development increases stormwater runoff volumes, causing higher peak stormwater discharges at higher velocities that cause scouring and erosion of stream banks. Erosion increases suspended solids concentrations and turbidity in receiving waters, and carries heavy metals, household wastes, excess nutrients, and other pollutants into these waters. Increased nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment results in algal growth that depresses levels of dissolved oxygen in receiving waters. The degradation of water quality adversely impacts wildlife habitat and public health.

Maintaining high water quality standards and restoring degraded systems have been mandated in Chapter 90.58 RCW. In February of 2007, the City received its Western Washington Phase II Municipal Stormwater Permit from the Washington State Department of Ecology. Under this permit the City developed a Stormwater Management Program. The City has adopted the King County Stormwater Drainage Manual which applies to all development activities within the City.

B.    Water Quality, Stormwater, and Non-Point Pollution Policies.

1.    All shoreline uses and activities should be located, designed, constructed and maintained to mitigate the adverse impacts to water quality.

2.    Water quality education efforts should be used to reduce the potential sources of pollutants to Angle Lake and other natural waterways. The reduction of the sources of fecal coliform should be emphasized in the Angle Lake sub-basin until the City can provide sufficient data to the Department Ecology to have the (303)(d) listing removed from Angle Lake. These pollutant sources include failing septic systems, ducks, geese and dog feces.

3.    Stormwater impacts should be addressed through the application of the most recent edition of the adopted Surface Water Design Manual and all applicable City stormwater regulations.

4.    New impervious surfaces should be limited within the shoreline management area by setting maximum impervious surface standards for new development and redevelopment and encouraging the use of pervious pavements and other low impact development technologies.

5.    The City should work with Midway Sewer District and the King County Health Department to ensure existing septic systems are working properly to prevent groundwater and surface water degradation through excessive inputs of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and hazardous microbes.

6.    The City should work with Midway Sewer District to require connection to the sanitary sewer system when existing properties on septic systems are developed, redeveloped or substantially modified.

7.    The City should continue to provide general information to the public about the use of land and human activities which impact water quality. This could be accomplished by encouraging educational curricula that provide students with firsthand exposure to the issues and solutions, and through community activities, such as Adopt-a-Stream programs.

8.    The City should encourage homeowners and property managers to use non-chemical weed and pest control solutions and natural fertilizers.

C.    Water Quality, Stormwater, and Non-Point Pollution Regulations.

1.    All shoreline development, both during and after construction, shall minimize impacts related to surface runoff through control, treatment and release of surface water runoff such that there is no net loss of receiving water quality in the shoreline environment. Control measures include but are not limited to dikes, runoff intercepting ditches, catch basins, settling wet ponds, sedimentation ponds, oil/water separators, filtration systems, grassy swales, planted buffers, and fugitive dust controls. Erosion and sediment controls shall be applied as specified by the temporary ESC measures and performance criteria and implementation requirements in Appendices C and D of the Surface Water Design Manual.

2.    Shoreline development and uses shall adhere to all required setbacks, buffers and standards for stormwater BMP design and maintenance as identified in the Surface Water Design Manual.

3.    All shoreline development shall comply with the applicable requirements of the City’s adopted Surface Water Design Manual and all applicable City stormwater regulations.

4.    All shoreline development shall implement applicable low impact development techniques to the maximum extent feasible, pursuant to the standards contained in the adopted Surface Water Design Manual and the Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound or successor. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 4.7)) 

Article V. Shoreline Environments 


18.05.260 Introduction to Shoreline Environment Designations

A.    The basic intent of a shoreline environment designation is to preserve and enhance shoreline ecological functions and to encourage development that will enhance the present or desired future character of the shoreline. To accomplish this, shoreline segments are given an environment designation based on existing development patterns, biological capabilities and limitations, and the aspirations of the local citizenry.

B.    Environment designations are categories that reflect the type of development that has or should take place in a given area. The Shoreline Master Program Guidelines recommend classifying shoreline environments using the following categories: “high-intensity,” “shoreline residential,” “urban conservancy,” “rural conservancy,” “natural,” and “aquatic.”

C.    These categories represent a relative range of development, from high- to low-intensity land use:

1.    “High-intensity” is appropriate for areas of high-intensity water-oriented commercial, transportation, and industrial development.

2.    “Shoreline residential” is intended to accommodate residential development, and appropriate public access and recreational uses consistent with other elements of shoreline management.

3.    “Urban conservancy” is a designation designed to protect and restore the ecological functions of open space, floodplain and other sensitive lands where they exist in urban and developed areas.

4.    “Rural conservancy” is intended for areas that protect ecological functions and conserve existing natural resources and that support, or have the capability to support, agricultural and recreational uses.

5.    “Natural” is intended to protect shorelines that remain relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions that cannot support human use.

6.    And finally, “aquatic” is a designation intended to protect, restore, and manage the areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

D.    Additionally, local governments may establish an alternative environment designation(s); provided, that it is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Shoreline Management Act and the Guidelines, including WAC 173-26-211(5). For the City of SeaTac, a locally unique, Medium-Intensity parallel environmental designation is established for upland areas on tax parcel 042204-9009. Running parallel to this is the more protective designation, Urban Conservancy, which is assigned to the area along the lakeshore. Ecology acknowledges the need for parallel designations in some cases to balance between use and protection.

E.    Once a shoreline segment has been given an environment designation, management policies are developed. These management policies are used as the basis for determining uses and activities that can be permitted in each environment designation. Specific development standards are also established, which specify how and where permitted development can take place within each shoreline environment. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.1)) 


18.05.270 Need for Consistency

A.    The Shoreline Management Act requires that policies for lands adjacent to the shorelines be consistent with the Shoreline Management Act, implementing rules, and the local shoreline master program. Conversely, local comprehensive plans provide the underlying framework within which master program provisions should fit. The Growth Management Act requires that shoreline master program policies be incorporated as an element of the comprehensive plan, and that all elements be internally consistent. In addition, under the Growth Management Act, all development regulations must be consistent with the comprehensive plan.

B.    The Shoreline Guidelines identify three (3) criteria for use in evaluating the consistency between master program environment designation provisions and the corresponding comprehensive plan elements and development regulations. In order for shoreline designation provisions, local comprehensive plan land use designations, and development regulations to be internally consistent, all three (3) of the conditions below should be met:

1.    Provisions Not Precluding One Another. Comprehensive plan provisions and shoreline environment designation provisions should not preclude one another. To meet this criterion, the provisions of both the comprehensive plan and the master program must be able to be met. Further, when considered together and applied to any one (1) piece of property, the master program use policies and regulations and the local zoning or other use regulations should not conflict in a manner that all viable uses of the property are precluded.

2.    Use Compatibility. Land use policies and regulations should protect preferred shoreline uses from being impacted by incompatible uses. The intent is to prevent existing or potential future water-oriented uses, especially water-dependent uses, from being restricted on shoreline areas because of impacts to nearby non-water-oriented uses. To be consistent, master programs, comprehensive plans, and development regulations should prevent new uses that are not compatible with preferred uses from locating where they may restrict preferred uses or development.

3.    Sufficient Infrastructure. Infrastructure and services provided in the comprehensive plan should be sufficient to support allowed shoreline uses. Shoreline uses should not be allowed where the comprehensive plan does not provide sufficient roads, utilities, and other services to support them. Infrastructure plans must also be mutually consistent with shoreline designations. Where they do exist, utility services routed through shoreline areas shall not be a sole justification for more intense development. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.2)) 


18.05.280 City of SeaTac Shoreline Environment Designations

A.    This Master Program establishes five (5) shoreline environments for the City of SeaTac. These shoreline environments shall include the shorelines of the City of SeaTac, including shorelands, surface waters, and bedlands.

B.    These environments are derived from the SeaTac Shoreline Analysis Report, the SeaTac Comprehensive Plan, and the environments recommended by the Shoreline Management Act and the Shoreline Guidelines. SeaTac’s Shoreline Analysis Report provides an inventory of natural and built conditions within the City’s shoreline jurisdiction. The conditions identified in the inventory have been compared with the recommended shoreline environments and the most appropriate environments selected. The five (5) SeaTac shoreline environment designations are:

1.    High-Intensity;

2.    Medium-Intensity;

3.    Shoreline Residential;

4.    Urban Conservancy; and

5.    Aquatic.

C.    These shoreline environments are illustrated for the City of SeaTac in Figure 1 (Shoreline Environment Designation Map), located at the end of this article, and described in the text below. Any undesignated shorelines are automatically assigned an Urban Conservancy environment designation. Each shoreline description includes a definition and statement of purpose, followed by designation criteria, management policies, and development standards specific to that shoreline environment. Shoreline development standards are summarized in Table I and regulations that apply throughout the SMP (except where specifically provided) are included at the end of this article. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.3)) 


18.05.290 High-Intensity Environment

A.    Purpose. The purpose of the High-Intensity environment designation is to provide for high-intensity water-oriented commercial and transportation uses while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions in areas that have been previously degraded.

B.    Designation Criteria. Assign a High-Intensity environment designation to shoreline areas that currently support higher-intensity commercial uses, or are suitable and planned for high-intensity uses in the future.

C.    Designated Areas.

1.    Description. The only High-Intensity area within SeaTac’s shoreline jurisdiction is the area currently comprised of office developments and surface parking along International Boulevard, as shown in Figure 1.

2.    Rationale. The High-Intensity designation is appropriate for areas of existing and planned commercial use. The area is currently occupied by commercial uses and zoned for Urban High Density Residential (UH-900) under SeaTac’s development regulations. It is also the only area within the shoreline jurisdiction designated for Commercial Medium uses in the City’s Comprehensive Plan.

D.    Management Policies.

1.    Full utilization of existing High-Intensity area should be achieved before further expansion of the High-Intensity environment is allowed.

2.    Water-dependent, water-related, and water-enjoyment uses (in that order) shall be given priority over non-water-oriented uses. Commercial uses that are non-water-oriented are allowed, provided public access is provided for new development. Residential uses are also allowed under this SMP.

3.    Where applicable, new development shall include environmental cleanup and restoration of the shoreline to comply with any relevant State and Federal law.

4.    Where feasible, visual and physical public access should be required in all new non-residential development.

5.    Aesthetic objectives should be implemented by means such as sign control regulations, appropriate development siting, screening and architectural standards, and maintenance of natural vegetative buffers.

6.    Explore the possibility of acquiring easements across High-Intensity properties adjacent to the shoreline to develop a public trail between tax parcel 042204-9009 and Angle Lake Park.

E.    Development Standards.

1.    Shoreline Use.

a.    The following uses are prohibited in the shoreline High-Intensity environment:

i.    Aquaculture.

ii.    Dry cleaners.

iii.    Mobile refueling operations.

iv.    Forest practices.

v.    Manufacturing.

vi.    Mining.

vii.    Parking as a primary use.

viii.    Solid waste disposal or transfer sites (excluding storage of recyclable materials).

b.    Additional allowed, conditional and prohibited uses for the shoreline High-Intensity environment are listed in SMC 18.05.370, Shoreline Use Standards, Table III.

2.    Height Limit. Except in those cases when the height requirements of the underlying zones are more restrictive, no new or expanded building or structure shall have a height of thirty-five (35) feet to a maximum height of fifty-five (55) feet above average grade level, except the height limit shall not apply to television antennas, chimneys, flagpoles, public utilities, and similar appurtenances. Heights over thirty-five (35) feet can only be achieved if the applicant prepares a view corridor study indicating that the proposed structure would not obstruct the view of the lake of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining the shoreline, otherwise the maximum height of thirty-five (35) feet shall apply.

3.    Setbacks. Unless otherwise specified herein, permanent and temporary structures and all new development not identified in subsection (E)(3)(a) of this section shall be set back from the ordinary high water mark as indicated in Table I and the related development regulations in Chapter 15.400 SMC, Dimensional Standards and Regulations. Setbacks are measured landward, on a horizontal plane, perpendicular to the shoreline.

a.    Development associated with water-dependent uses, public and private access to the water and ecological restoration is not required to meet the minimum setback. However, where such development is approved within the minimum setback, the placement of structures and hard surfaces shall be limited to the minimum necessary for the feasible operation of the use.

4.    All development shall comply with the standards for interior setbacks, yard requirements and all applicable provisions in the SeaTac Municipal Code for the zone in which the development occurs. In the event of a conflict between a provision in this SMP and a provision in another part of the SMC, the requirement that provides the most protection to the shoreline management area shall be applied.

5.    Lot Width and Frontage. The minimum required width of a lot and lake frontage in the High-Intensity environment shall be one hundred (100) feet.

6.    Impervious Coverage. The amount of impervious surface shall be the minimum necessary to provide for the intended use. New development shall have a maximum fifty percent (50%) impervious surface coverage within the shoreline area, unless a variance is approved. LID should be the commonly used approach to minimize impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff where feasible pursuant to the Surface Water Design Manual.

7.    Dimensional standards for the High-Intensity environment are summarized in Table I at the end of this article. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.4)) 


18.05.300 Medium-Intensity Environment

A.    Purpose. The purpose of the Medium-Intensity environment designation is to provide for high density multi-family housing and resident-oriented commercial uses that are part of a mixed-use project, while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions in areas that have been previously degraded. Recreation and public access are also encouraged in this environment.

B.    Designation Criteria. Assign a Medium-Intensity environment designation to shoreline areas that currently support medium-intensity residential uses, or are suitable and planned for medium-intensity mixed use and residential uses in the future because of their current use and condition, adjacent land use and the goals and aspirations of the community.

C.    Designated Areas.

1.    Description. The only Medium-Intensity area within SeaTac’s shoreline jurisdiction is the upland portion of tax parcel 042204-9009 that is located at least one hundred (100) feet from the OHWM of Angle Lake. This property is located east of International Boulevard and borders multi-family residential property and commercial property. The Medium-Intensity designation runs parallel to an Urban Conservancy designation, which encompasses shorelands adjacent to and within one hundred (100) feet of the OHWM of Angle Lake, as shown in Figure 1.

2.    Rationale. A parallel designation of Medium-Intensity and Urban Conservancy reflects the different management objectives for this shoreline segment and attempts to define a balance between use and protection. More intense urban development is anticipated near International Boulevard outside the SMA, and similar multi-family and mixed use development may extend to areas within the Medium-Intensity environment. However, preservation of the existing high ecological values and functions within this segment is needed. This area is currently designated for high density residential uses in the City’s Comprehensive Plan.

D.    Management Policies.

1.    Full utilization of the existing Medium-Intensity area should be achieved before further expansion of the Medium-Intensity environment is allowed.

2.    Water-dependent, water-related, and water-enjoyment uses (in that order) shall be given priority over non-water-oriented uses. Certain commercial uses as permitted in the underlying zone that are non-water-oriented are allowed, provided public access is provided for new development. Residential uses are encouraged.

3.    Multi-family and multi-lot residential and recreational developments should provide public access to the shoreline and joint use facilities for community recreational needs.

4.    Regulations shall assure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions as a result of new development. Where applicable, new development shall include environmental cleanup and restoration to comply with any relevant State and Federal law.

5.    Where feasible, visual and physical public access shall be required for all new non-residential development.

6.    Aesthetic objectives should be implemented by means such as sign control regulations, appropriate development siting, screening and architectural standards, and maintenance of natural vegetative buffers.

E.    Development Standards.

1.    Shoreline Use.

a.    The following uses are prohibited in the Medium-Intensity environment:

i.    Aquaculture.

ii.    Commercial uses as a primary use (small, resident-oriented commercial uses that are part of a mixed-use project may be permitted).

iii.    Dry cleaners.

iv.    Mobile refueling operations.

v.    Forest practices.

vi.    Manufacturing uses.

vii.    Mining.

viii.    Parking as a primary use.

ix.    Solid waste disposal or transfer sites (excluding storage of recyclable materials).

b.    Additional allowed, conditional and prohibited uses for the shoreline Medium-Intensity environment are listed in SMC 18.05.370, Shoreline Use Standards, Table III.

2.    Height Limit. Except in those cases when the height requirements of the underlying zones are more restrictive, no new or expanded building or structure shall have a height of thirty-five (35) feet to a maximum height of fifty-five (55) feet above average grade level, except the height limit shall not apply to television antennas, chimneys, flagpoles, public utilities, and similar appurtenances. Heights over thirty-five (35) feet can only be achieved if the applicant prepares a view corridor study indicating that the proposed structure would not obstruct the view of the lake of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining the shoreline, otherwise the maximum height of thirty-five (35) feet shall apply.

3.    Setbacks. All development shall comply with the standards for setbacks, yard requirements and all applicable provisions in the SeaTac Municipal Code for the zone in which the development occurs. In the event of a conflict between a provision in this SMP and a provision in another part of the SMC, the requirement that provides the most protection to the shoreline management area shall be applied.

4.    Lot Width. The minimum required lot width in the Medium-Intensity environment shall be one hundred (100) feet.

5.    Impervious Coverage. The amount of impervious surface shall be the minimum necessary to provide for the intended use. New development shall have no more than forty percent (40%) impervious surface coverage within the shoreline area, unless a variance is approved. LID should be the commonly used approach to minimize impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff where feasible pursuant to the Surface Water Design Manual.

6.    All dimensional standards for the Medium-Intensity environment are summarized in Table I at the end of this article. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.5)) 


18.05.310 Shoreline Residential Environment

A.    Purpose. The Shoreline Residential environment designation is designed to provide for residential needs where the necessary facilities for development can be provided. An additional purpose is to provide appropriate public access and recreational uses.

B.    Designation Criteria. Assign a Shoreline Residential environment designation to shoreline areas if they are predominantly single-family or multi-family residential development or are planned and platted for residential development.

C.    Designated Areas.

1.    Description. Shoreline Residential areas include those areas adjacent to Angle Lake that are currently developed as single-family or multi-family, where that use is anticipated to continue in the future.

2.    Rationale. The segments of shoreline designated as Shoreline Residential are predominately residential and are planned for low to moderate residential density.

D.    Management Policies.

1.    Residential activities are preferred over other land and resource consumptive development or uses.

2.    Limited non-residential uses, such as parks, day cares, home occupation businesses, may be allowed, provided they are consistent with the residential character.

3.    Development should be located, sited, designed and maintained to protect, enhance and be compatible with the shoreline environment.

4.    Development regulations should require the preservation of ecological functions, taking into account the environmental limitations and sensitivity of the shoreline area, the level of infrastructure and services available, and other comprehensive planning considerations.

5.    Multi-family and multi-lot residential and recreational developments should provide public access to the shoreline and joint use facilities for community recreational needs.

6.    Low impact development (LID) techniques, such as minimizing effective impervious surfaces, infiltration of runoff, use of green roofs and pervious pavers, and other techniques, shall be encouraged.

7.    Private property owners should be encouraged to preserve and enhance native shoreline vegetation and use environmentally friendly landscaping practices, through incentives, information and other assistance.

E.    Development Standards.

1.    Shoreline Use.

a.    The following are prohibited in the Shoreline Residential environment:

i.    Aquaculture.

ii.    Commercial uses as a primary use (commercial uses that are incidental to the primary residential use and are compatible with the residential character of the neighborhood, such as home occupations, may be permitted).

iii.    Forest practices.

iv.    Manufacturing uses.

v.    Mining.

vi.    Parking as a primary use.

vii.    Non-water-oriented recreational facilities as a primary use (recreational facilities as an accessory use and multi-use trails may be permitted upon approval of a conditional use permit; minor trails are permitted).

viii.    Solid waste disposal or transfer sites (excluding storage of recyclable materials).

b.    Additional allowed, conditional and prohibited uses for the Shoreline Residential environment are listed in SMC 18.05.370, Shoreline Use Standards, Table III.

2.    Height Limit. New or expanded building or structure shall not exceed a height of thirty (30) feet above average grade level for single-family development. Multi-family development shall be regulated by the underlying zoning but in no case shall the height exceed fifty-five (55) feet above average grade level (unless as specified under SMC 15.400.100). The height limit shall not apply to television antennas, chimneys, flagpoles, public utilities, and similar appurtenances. Heights over thirty-five (35) feet can only be achieved if the applicant prepares a view corridor study indicating that the proposed structure would not obstruct the view of the lake of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining the shoreline, otherwise the maximum height limit of thirty-five (35) feet shall apply.

3.    Setbacks. Unless otherwise specified herein, permanent structures and non-water-related accessory structures shall be set back from the ordinary high water mark as indicated in Article VI of this chapter, Table I and the related development regulations for residential development. Setbacks are measured landward, on a horizontal plane perpendicular to the shoreline (more restrictive than current CAO).

a.    Permanent and temporary structures shall be set back from the ordinary high water mark as indicated in Article VI of this chapter, Table II and the related development regulations for residential development in Article VI of this chapter. Setbacks are measured landward, on a horizontal plane, perpendicular to the shoreline.

b.    Development associated with water-dependent uses, shoreline access and ecological restoration is not required to meet the minimum setback. However, where such development is approved within the minimum setback, the placement of structures and hard surfaces shall be limited to the minimum necessary for the feasible operation of the use.

4.    All development shall comply with the standards for interior setbacks, yard requirements and all applicable provisions in the SeaTac Municipal Code for the zone in which the development occurs. In the event of a conflict between a provision in this SMP and a provision in another part of the SMC, the requirement that provides the most protection to the shoreline management area shall be applied.

5.    Lot Width. The minimum required lot width and lake frontage in the Shoreline Residential environment shall be fifty (50) feet.

6.    Impervious Coverage. The amount of impervious surface shall be the minimum necessary to provide for the intended use. New development shall have no more than forty percent (40%) impervious surface coverage, unless a variance is approved. LID should be the commonly used approach to minimize impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff where feasible pursuant to the Surface Water Design Manual.

7.    Dimensional standards for the Shoreline Residential environment are summarized in Table I at the end of this article. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.6)) 


18.05.320 Urban Conservancy Environment

A.    Purpose. The purpose of the Urban Conservancy environment designation is to protect and restore ecological functions of open space, floodplain and other sensitive lands where they exist in urban and developed settings, while allowing a variety of compatible uses.

B.    Designation Criteria. Areas designated Urban Conservancy are those areas where one (1) or more of the following characteristics apply:

1.    They are suitable for water-related or water-enjoyment uses;

2.    They are open space, floodplain or other sensitive areas that should not be more intensively developed;

3.    They have potential for ecological restoration;

4.    They retain important ecological functions, even though partially developed; or

5.    They have the potential for development that is compatible with ecological restoration.

C.    Designated Areas.

1.    Description. Urban Conservancy areas include shorelands within Angle Lake Park and portions of tax parcel 042204-9009 where open space and areas with important ecological functions exist, as shown in Figure 1.

2.    Rationale. Angle Lake Park is constrained by current zoning regulations and the shorelands of tax parcel 042204-9009 retain important ecological functions. A parallel designation of Medium-Intensity encompasses the upland portions of tax parcel 042204-9009, which has the potential for more intense development. In contrast, the lower portion of tax parcel 042204-9009 adjacent to the shoreline has an Urban Conservancy designation since the use of this area is expected to be limited to public access and other uses that are compatible with ecological restoration. This designation will preserve and enhance the ecological functions of the undeveloped portions of the shoreline while retaining future options for passive and active shoreline recreation and public access.

D.    Management Policies.

1.    Uses that preserve the natural character of the area or promote preservation of open space or sensitive lands either directly or over the long term should be the primary allowed uses. Uses that result in restoration of ecological functions should be allowed if the use is otherwise compatible with the purpose of the environment and the setting.

2.    Water-dependent recreation uses, such as public access piers, recreational floats and boat launches, shall be the highest priority, provided they can be located, designed, constructed, operated, and mitigated in a manner that ensures no net loss of ecological function.

3.    Water-oriented recreation uses, such as viewing trails, benches and shelters, should be emphasized and non-water-oriented uses should be minimized and allowed only as an accessory use; for example, picnic areas, forest trails and small playground areas would be acceptable, but tennis courts and developed sports fields would not.

4.    Standards should be established for shoreline stabilization, vegetation conservation, water quality, and shoreline modifications to ensure that new development does not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or further degrade other shoreline values.

5.    Public access and public recreation objectives should be implemented whenever feasible and whenever significant ecological impacts can be mitigated.

6.    Approved low impact development techniques should be emphasized for any development occurring within the Urban Conservancy environment.

E.    Development Standards.

1.    Shoreline Use.

a.    Land uses that are permitted in the Urban Conservancy shoreline environment include:

i.    Water-oriented recreation.

ii.    Non-water-oriented recreation as an accessory use.

iii.    Minor trails.

iv.    Scientific, historical, cultural and educational uses.

v.    Restoration activities.

vi.    Utilities (accessory).

b.    The following may be permitted as conditional uses in the Urban Conservancy environment:

i.    Boating facilities.

ii.    Ancillary commercial development.

iii.    Parking as an accessory use.

iv.    Multi-use trails.

v.    Transportation facilities.

vi.    Utilities (primary).

c.    All new uses and developments permitted or allowed as conditional uses in the Urban Conservancy environment must be compatible with conserving, protecting and restoring ecological conditions of the shoreline.

d.    The following uses are prohibited in the Urban Conservancy environment:

i.    Aquaculture.

ii.    Commercial uses (primary).

iii.    Non-water-oriented recreational facilities (primary).

iv.    Forest practices.

v.    Manufacturing.

vi.    Mining.

vii.    Residential development.

viii.    Roads, utilities and parking areas that can be located outside of the shoreline area.

e.    New uses and developments must demonstrate consistency with the Urban Conservancy management policies.

f.    Additional allowed, conditional and prohibited uses for the Urban Conservancy shoreline environment are listed in SMC 18.05.370, Shoreline Use Standards, Table III.

2.    Height Limit. Except in those cases when the height requirements of the underlying zones are more restrictive, no new or expanded building or structure shall exceed a height of thirty-five (35) feet above average grade level, except the height limit shall not apply to television antennas, chimneys, flagpoles, public utilities, and similar appurtenances.

3.    Setbacks.

a.    Permanent and temporary structures and all other non-water-related development shall be set back from the ordinary high water mark as indicated in Table I and the related development regulations for recreation in Article VI of this chapter. Setbacks are measured landward, on a horizontal plane, perpendicular to the shoreline.

b.    All development shall comply with the standards for interior setbacks, yard requirements and all applicable provisions in the SeaTac Municipal Code (SMC) for the zone in which the development occurs. In the event of a conflict between a provision in this SMP and a provision in another part of the SMC, the requirement that provides the most protection to the shoreline management area shall be applied.

c.    Developments associated with an ecological restoration or interpretation, water-dependent uses and public access are not required to meet the minimum setback. However, where such development can be approved within the minimum setback, the placement of structures and hard surfaces shall be limited to the minimum necessary for the successful operation of the use. In no case shall parking be allowed within the minimum setback without a shoreline variance that reduces the setback to allow parking outside of the reduced setback.

4.    Lot Width. The minimum required lot width and lake frontage in the Urban Conservancy environment shall be one hundred (100) feet.

5.    Impervious Coverage. The amount of impervious surface shall be the minimum necessary to provide for the intended use. New development shall have no more than ten percent (10%) impervious surface coverage, unless a variance is approved. LID should be the commonly used approach to minimize impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff where feasible pursuant to the Surface Water Design Manual.

6.    Dimensional standards for the Urban Conservancy environment are summarized in Table I at the end of this article. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.7)) 


18.05.330 Aquatic Environment

A.    Purpose. The purpose of the Aquatic environment designation is to protect, restore, and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

B.    Designation Criteria. Assign an Aquatic environment designation to areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark.

C.    Designated Areas.

1.    Description. Aquatic areas include all areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark as shown in Figure 1.

D.    Management Policies.

1.    Allow new overwater structures only for water-dependent uses, public access, or ecological restoration.

2.    The size of new overwater structures should be limited to the minimum necessary to support the structure’s intended use.

3.    To reduce the impacts of shoreline development and increase effective use of water resources, multiple uses of overwater facilities should be encouraged.

4.    All developments and uses on waters or their beds should be located and designed to minimize interference with surface navigation, to consider impacts to public views, and to allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration.

5.    Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical freshwater habitats should not be allowed except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when their impacts are mitigated according to the sequence described in WAC 173-26-201(2)(e) as necessary to assure no net loss of ecological functions.

6.    Shoreline uses and modifications should be designed and managed to prevent degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions.

E.    Development Standards. Regulations and performance standards that apply to individual uses and developments are listed in Article VI of this chapter, including a summary of allowed, conditional and permitted uses in Table III. Table I below summarizes the dimensional standards in this article.

Table I. Summary of Shoreline Dimensional Standards  

	Shoreline Standard	High-Intensity	Medium-Intensity	Shoreline Residential	Urban Conservancy	Aquatic4

	Maximum Height	55 ft.1	55 ft.1	30 ft. (55 ft.1 in areas zoned UH-900 and 40 ft. in areas zoned UM-3,600)	35 ft.	N/A6

	Shoreline Setback2	65 ft. (standard) may be reduced to 50 ft. (minimum) with enhancement	N/A3	65 ft. (standard) may be reduced to 50 ft. (minimum) with enhancement	100 ft. (standard) may be reduced to 65 ft. (minimum) with enhancement5	N/A6

	Maximum Impervious Surface Coverage	50%	40%	40%	10%	N/A6

	Minimum Lot Frontage and Width	100 ft.	100 ft.	50 ft.	100 ft.	N/A6

	Minimum Lot Size and Lot Density	900 sq. ft. per unit (except 3,000 sq. ft. for single-family)	900 sq. ft. per unit (except 3,000 sq. ft. for single-family)	7,200 sq. ft. (except 900 sq. ft. per unit in UH-900 and 3,600 sq. ft. per unit in UM-3,600)	No further subdivision is allowed	N/A6

1    Development shall also be subject to the height limits established by the underlying zoning, but in no case shall the height exceed fifty-five (55) feet above average grade level. The height limit shall not apply to television antennas, chimneys, flagpoles, public utilities, and similar appurtenances. A height of more than thirty-five (35) feet can only be achieved if the applicant prepares a view corridor study indicating that the proposed structure would not obstruct the view of the lake of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining the shoreline.

2    The standard setback applies unless the applicant implements voluntary enhancements as described in the flexible shoreline setback regulations and in Table II below. The setback may be reduced by the Shoreline Administrator to the minimum setback indicated in Table I. Please see zoning regulations for interior lot setbacks and other requirements that apply to specific zones.

3    The Medium-Intensity environment is a parallel environment located a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from the OHWM of Angle Lake, therefore no shoreline setback applies.

4    Land based standards do not apply in the Aquatic designation. Height of all structures shall be the minimum necessary for the proposed water-dependent use.

5    No reduction is allowed from the one hundred (100) foot minimum shoreline setback on tax parcel 042204-9009, where the Urban Conservancy environment is parallel with the Medium-Intensity environment and more restrictive requirements are necessary to protect comparatively high ecological function.

6    Not Applicable. Standard is generally not applicable in the Aquatic environment because only water-dependent structures and development, such as docks, are allowed.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 5.8)) 


18.05.340 Flexible Shoreline Setback Regulations

In addition to the specific requirements for particular uses, the following standards shall apply:

A.    A sixty-five (65) foot standard setback shall be established from the ordinary high water mark for all lots, except that a one hundred (100) foot standard setback shall be established from the ordinary high water mark on lots within the Urban Conservancy designation.

B.    On all properties other than Urban Conservancy, the standard setback may be reduced down to a minimum of fifty (50) feet when setback reduction impacts are mitigated using a combination of the mitigation options provided in Table II to achieve an equal or greater protection of lake ecological functions. At least one (1) water-related action must be undertaken in order to achieve the full setback reduction allowed. A maximum of ten (10) feet in cumulative setback reduction may be achieved under upland-related actions.

C.    No setback reduction is allowed on tax parcel 042204-9009 in order to protect the relatively high level of ecological function. At Angle Lake Park, the one hundred (100) foot setback may be reduced to a minimum of sixty-five (65) feet, when setback reduction impacts are mitigated using a combination of the mitigation options provided in Table II to achieve an equal or greater protection of lake ecological functions. At least one (1) water-related action must be undertaken in order to achieve the full setback reduction allowed. A maximum of ten (10) feet in cumulative setback reduction may be achieved under upland-related actions.

D.    All property owners who obtain approval for a reduction in the setback must record the final approved setback and corresponding conditions in a notice on title, and provide a copy of the notice on title to the Shoreline Administrator.

E.    All property owners who obtain approval for a reduction in the setback must prepare, and agree to adhere to, a shoreline vegetation management plan, in accordance with SMC 15.700.140, prepared by a qualified professional and approved by the Shoreline Administrator that includes appropriate limitations on the use of fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides as needed to protect lake water quality. This plan shall be added to a notice on title, and a copy of the notice on title provided to the Shoreline Administrator.

F.    Restoration of native vegetation as discussed below shall consist of a mixture of trees, shrubs and ground cover and be designed to improve habitat functions. Restoration of native vegetation may include vegetated LID BMPs. Preparation of a revegetation plan shall be completed by a qualified professional and include a monitoring and maintenance program that shall, at a minimum, include the following:

1.    The goals and objectives for the mitigation plan;

2.    The criteria for assessing the mitigation;

3.    A monitoring plan that includes annual progress reports submitted to the Shoreline Administrator and that lasts for a period sufficient to establish that performance standards have been met as determined by the Shoreline Administrator, but no less than five (5) years; and

4.    A contingency plan.

G.    Whenever the Shoreline Administrator determines that monitoring has established a significant adverse deviation from predicted impacts, or that mitigation or maintenance measures have failed, the applicant or the property owner shall be required to institute correction action, which shall also be subject to further monitoring as provided in this section.

H.    The Shoreline Administrator may require a performance bond(s) or other security in an amount sufficient to guarantee that all required mitigation measures will be completed in a manner that complies with conditions of approval and to guarantee satisfactory workmanship and materials for a period not to exceed five (5) years. The Shoreline Administrator shall establish the conditions of the bond or other security according to the nature of the proposed mitigation, maintenance or monitoring and the likelihood and expense of correcting mitigation or maintenance failures.

I.    All costs associated with the mitigation/monitoring and planning including City expenses shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

J.    The following shoreline setback reduction standards apply to all development in shoreline jurisdiction, including redevelopment, outside of tax parcel 042204-9009 in the Urban Conservancy environment. Shoreline setbacks may be reduced by the following standards identified in Table II below.

K.    Any further reduction of shoreline setbacks beyond the minimum listed in this article shall require a shoreline variance.

 

Table II. Shoreline Setback Reduction Mechanisms  

	Reduction Mechanism	Reduction Allowance

	Water-Related Actions

	1	Removal of an existing bulkhead covering at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the shoreline frontage which is located at, below, or within 5 feet landward of the shoreline’s ordinary high water mark (OHWM) and subsequent restoration of the shoreline to a natural or semi-natural state, including restoration of topography, beach/substrate composition and stabilization of disturbed soils with native vegetation.	15 feet

	2	Removal of an existing bulkhead covering at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shoreline frontage which is located at, below, or within 5 feet landward of the shoreline’s OHWM and subsequent restoration of the shoreline to a natural or semi-natural state, including restoration of topography, beach/substrate composition and stabilization of disturbed soils with native vegetation.	10 feet

	3	Preservation of existing trees and native vegetation and restoration of native vegetation, as necessary in at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the reduced (i.e., that portion remaining after reductions are applied) setback area. The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the setback area can be comprised of existing non-invasive, non-native vegetation. Up to 10 feet of frontage may be used for improved shoreline access, provided access areas are located to avoid 	15 feet

	 	areas of greater sensitivity and habitat value. (Note: this incentive cannot be used by any properties that currently have substantial multi-layered native vegetation in seventy-five percent (75%) of the setback area. The reduction would only be granted if ecological functions would be improved relative to the existing condition.)	 

	4	Preservation of existing natural shoreline conditions (e.g., no bulkhead or other unnatural shoreline features such as upland impervious surfaces or other structural alterations allowed) within 10 feet of the OHWM, including preservation of existing native vegetation.	10 feet

	5	Preservation of existing trees and native vegetation and restoration of native vegetation in at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the reduced setback area. Up to 10 feet of frontage may be used for improved shoreline access, provided access areas are located to avoid areas of greater sensitivity and habitat value. (Note: this incentive cannot be used by any properties that currently have substantial multi-layered native vegetation in twenty-five percent (25%) of the setback area. The reduction would only be granted if ecological functions would be improved relative to the existing condition.)	5 feet

	Upland-Related Actions

	6	Installation of filtration/infiltration BMPs such as rain gardens, bioretention, roof downspout controls, dispersion, bioswales, created and/or enhanced wetlands, other infiltration facilities, infiltration ponds or other approved low impact development BMPs that treat the majority of surface water runoff from a site and exceed adopted stormwater requirements. (Note: stormwater ponds serving more than one property should be located outside of shoreline jurisdiction if possible.)	10 feet

	7	Installation of a “vegetated” roof in accordance with the Surface Water Design Manual and applicable codes.	10 feet

	8	Installation of permeable pavement for driveway, sidewalk, parking, or street surfaces.	5 feet

	9	Limiting total impervious surface, e.g., pathways or patios for water access and enjoyment, in the reduced setback area to less than five percent (5%), provided the applicant complies with all other development requirements.	5 feet

	10	Preserving or restoring at least twenty percent (20%) of the total lot area outside of the setback area as native vegetation. No more than twenty percent (20%) of the total lot area can be lawn.	5 feet

f.    All debris and other waste materials from roadway construction shall be disposed of in such a way as to prevent their entry into any water body.

g.    Road designs must provide safe pedestrian and nonmotorized vehicular crossings where public access to shorelines is intended.

h.    Streets within shoreline jurisdiction shall be designed with the minimum pavement area required. Gravel and more innovative materials shall be used where feasible for pathways and road shoulders to minimize the amount of impervious surfaces and help to maintain a more natural appearance.

i.    The City shall give preference to mechanical means for roadside brush control on roads in shoreline jurisdiction rather than the use of herbicides.

M.    Utilities (Primary).

1.    Applicability. Utilities are services and facilities that produce, transmit, store, process or dispose of electric power, gas, water, sewage, and communications. Utilities in this SMP are divided into primary and accessory based on type and scale. The provisions of this section apply to primary use and activities such as solid waste handling and disposal, water transmission lines, sewage treatment facilities and mains, power generating or high voltage transmission facilities, gas distribution lines and storage facilities, stormwater mains and regional stormwater treatment facilities.

2.    Policies.

a.    New primary utilities should be located outside of the shoreline jurisdiction unless no other feasible option exists. Where allowed they should utilize existing transportation and utility sites, rights-of-way and corridors whenever possible, rather than creating new corridors. Joint use of rights-of-way and corridors should be encouraged.

b.    Primary utilities shall be located landward of the ordinary high water mark unless such location is not feasible or would result in potentially greater environmental impacts.

c.    Primary utility facilities shall avoid disturbance of unique and fragile areas, as well as wildlife spawning, nesting and rearing areas. Utility facility development shall result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Mitigation shall be provided as necessary to meet this requirement. Failure to meet this standard will result in permit denial.

d.    Utility development shall, through coordination with local government agencies, provide for compatible, multiple use of sites and rights-of-way. Such uses include shoreline access points, trail systems and other forms of recreation and transportation, providing such uses will not unduly interfere with utility operations, endanger public health and safety or create a significant and disproportionate liability for the owner.

e.    Utility lines shall utilize existing rights-of-way, shared trenches, corridors and/or bridge crossings whenever possible and shall avoid duplication and construction of new corridors in all shoreline areas. Proposals for new corridors or water crossings must fully substantiate the infeasibility of existing routes.

f.    Solid waste disposal sites and facilities are prohibited in the shoreline environment.

g.    Where major facilities must be placed in a shoreline area, the location and design shall be chosen so as not to destroy or obstruct scenic views.

h.    Primary utility development shall provide screening of facilities from water bodies and adjacent properties. Screening, including native and drought tolerant landscaping or vegetated LID BMPs and fencing, shall be designed to constitute a dense “full screen.”

i.    Clearing of vegetation for the installation or maintenance of utilities shall be kept to a minimum and upon project completion any disturbed areas shall be restored to their pre-project condition.

j.    The City shall hold public meetings prior to the issuance of a substantial development permit for a major primary utility project in accordance with the administrative procedures outlined in this Master Program to allow for the greatest amount of public input to help guide utility-related decisions.

N.    Utilities (Accessory).

1.    Applicability. Utilities have been split into accessory and primary with “accessory” meaning utilities that affect small-scale distribution services connected directly to the uses along the shoreline. For example, power distribution, telephone, cable, water and sewer service lines, stormwater collection and conveyance are all considered as utilities accessory to shoreline uses. They are covered in this section because they concern all types of development and have the potential of impacting the ecological condition and visual quality of the shoreline and its waters.

2.    Policies.

a.    Utilities are necessary to serve shoreline uses and should be properly installed to protect the shoreline and water from contamination and degradation.

b.    Utility facilities and rights-of-way should be located outside of the shoreline area to the maximum extent possible. When utility lines require a shoreline location, they should be placed underground, where feasible.

c.    Utility facilities should be designed and located in a manner which preserves the natural landscape and shoreline ecology, and minimizes conflicts with present and planned land uses.

3.    Regulations.

a.    Utility developments shall, through coordination with local government agencies, provide for compatible, multiple uses of sites and rights-of-way. Such uses include shoreline access points, trail systems, and other forms of recreation and transportation, providing such uses will not unduly interfere with utility operations, or endanger public health and safety.

b.    In shoreline areas, accessory utilities shall be placed underground and in shared trenches unless demonstrated to be infeasible. Further, such lines shall utilize existing rights-of-way, and existing corridors whenever possible.

c.    Utility facilities shall be located and designed to avoid destruction of, or damage to, important wildlife areas, and other unique and fragile areas. Utility facility development shall result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Mitigation shall be provided as necessary to meet this requirement. Failure to meet this standard will result in permit denial.

d.    Clearing for the installation or maintenance of utilities shall be kept to a minimum, and upon project completion, any disturbed area shall be restored, to the greatest extent feasible, to pre-project conditions, including replanting with native species, or other species as approved by the City, and maintenance care. If the previous condition is identified as being undesirable for shoreline function, then landscaping and other improvements shall be undertaken.

e.    The location and construction of outfalls shall comply with all appropriate Federal, State, County and City regulations.

f.    The City shall maintain, enhance and restore public natural drainage systems to protect water quality, reduce flooding, reduce public costs and prevent associated environmental degradation for no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

g.    New utility lines including electricity, communications, and fuel lines shall be located underground and in shared trenches unless demonstrated to be infeasible. Existing above ground lines shall be moved underground when properties are redeveloped or in conjunction with major system upgrades or replacements.

h.    Utility development shall include public access to the shoreline, trail systems, and other forms of recreation, providing such uses will not unduly interfere with utility operations, endanger the public health, safety, and welfare, or create a significant and disproportionate liability for the owner.

i.    Proposals for new utility corridors shall fully substantiate the infeasibility of existing routes. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 6.2)) 

Article VII. Shoreline Modification Provisions 


18.05.390 Introduction

Shoreline modification activities are those actions that modify the physical configuration or qualities of the shoreline area. Shoreline modification activities are, by definition, undertaken in support of or in preparation for a permitted shoreline use. A single use may require several different shoreline modification activities.

Shoreline modification activity policies and regulations are intended to assure, at a minimum, no net loss of ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources and to prevent, reduce and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of proposed shoreline modifications consistent with the goals of the Shoreline Management Act. A proposed development must meet all of the regulations for both applicable uses and activities as well as the general and environment designation regulations.

This article has been divided into three (3) sections: Shoreline Stabilization, Dredging and Fill, and Overwater Structures. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 7.1)) 


18.05.400 Table of Shoreline Modification Activities

A.    Interpretation of Shoreline Modification Table. The shoreline modification table below determines whether a specific shoreline modification is allowed within each of the shoreline environments. See standards following the table for a full explanation of activities and required conditions for permitted activities. The shoreline environment is located on the vertical column of the table and the specific modification is located on the horizontal row of the table.

B.    The table should be interpreted as follows:

1.    If the letter “X” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the modification is not allowed in that shoreline environment.

2.    If the letter “P” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the modification may be allowed through a shoreline exemption or a shoreline substantial development permit, within the shoreline environment only if the underlying zoning allows the modification.

3.    If the letter “C” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the modification may be allowed within the shoreline environment subject to the shoreline conditional use review procedures specified in Article VIII of this chapter, and only if the underlying zoning allows the modification.

C.    Note that Medium- and High-Intensity environments are located along water bodies that do not generally accommodate navigation. No overwater structures exist in these areas currently, and future demand for overwater structures is not anticipated. These activities are therefore prohibited in these two (2) shoreline environments.

1    The Medium-Intensity shoreline environment is located one hundred (100) feet from the OHWM on tax parcel 042204-9009 so regulations for shoreline stabilization and overwater structures are not applicable (N/A).

2    Note these regulations are not applicable (N/A) either where the specific shoreline environment does not front the shoreline or where residential structures are not allowed in that environment or in an adjacent parallel environment.

(Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 7.2)) 


18.05.410 Shoreline Stabilization

A.    Applicability. Shoreline stabilization includes actions taken to address erosion impacts to property caused by natural processes, such as current, flood, wake or wave action. These actions include all structural and nonstructural methods. “Hard” structural stabilization measures refer to those with solid, hard surfaces, such as concrete or boulder bulkheads, while “soft” structural measures rely on less rigid materials, such as bioengineered vegetation measures or beach enhancement. Nonstructural methods include building setbacks, relocation of the structure to be protected, ground water management, planning and regulatory measures to avoid the need for structural stabilization.

Generally, the harder the construction measure, the greater the impact on shoreline processes, including sediment transport, geomorphology, and biological functions. The means taken to reduce damage caused by erosion, accretion, and flooding must recognize the positive aspects of each of these processes in order to retain the benefits of these natural occurrences. Erosion does not occur without accretion (deposition and accumulation) of material eroded, such as formation of a beach or a sandbar. Likewise, accretion cannot occur unless material has been eroded.

Specific structural methods for stabilization include beach restoration and enhancement, soil bioengineering, bulkheads, and groins along Angle Lake. A key regulatory distinction in this SMP is made between new stabilization measures and the replacement of existing stabilization measures. New stabilization measures include the enlargement of existing structures. Some of these techniques are currently being used in SeaTac as described below, or they are techniques that could be used to address local shoreline issues.

General policies and regulations addressing shoreline stabilization methods applicable to the City are presented in the following sections. Additional discussion of the individual stabilization methods, and policies and regulations specific to them, is provided following the general policies and regulations section.

1.    Beach Restoration or Enhancement on Angle Lake. Beach enhancement is the alteration of exposed and submerged shorelines for the purpose of stabilization, recreational enhancement, and/or aquatic habitat creation or restoration using native or similar material. The materials used are dependent on the intended use. For recreational purposes, various grades of clean sand or pea gravel are often used to create a beach above the ordinary high water mark. Restoration or re-creation of a shore feature may require a rock and gravel matrix and/or creation of other materials appropriate for the intended use.

2.    Soil Bioengineering. Soil bioengineering is the term given to the practice of using natural vegetative materials to stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. This may include use of bundles of stems, root systems, or other living plant material; fabric or other soil stabilization techniques; and limited rock toe protection, where appropriate. Soil bioengineering projects often include fisheries habitat enhancement measures such as anchored logs or root wads, in project design. Soil bioengineering techniques may be applied to shoreline areas and the upland areas away from the immediate shoreline.

The use of soil bioengineering as a shoreline stabilization technique is a viable and proven alternative to riprap, concrete and other structural solutions. It provides habitat while maintaining and preserving the natural character of the shoreline. Soil bioengineering is the preferred “best practices” choice when considering shoreline stabilization.

3.    Bulkheads. Bulkheads are shoreline structures, either sloped or vertical, usually constructed parallel to the shore. The primary purpose they serve is to contain and prevent the loss of soil caused by erosion or wave action.

Bulkheads have historically been constructed of poured-in-place or precast concrete, concrete blocks, steel or aluminum sheet piling, wood or wood and structural steel combinations, and boulders. Bulkheads may be either thin structures penetrating deep into the ground or more massive structures resting on the surface.

Uses and activities related to bulkheads which are identified as separate use activities in this Program, such as fill and residential development, are subject to the regulations for those uses in addition to the standards for bulkheads established in this section.

4.    Groins. Groins are barrier-type structures of rock, wooden piling or other materials constructed across the beach itself and extending into the water with the intent to obstruct sand and sediment carried by the littoral drift action along shorelines. Groins have limited applicability in SeaTac’s shoreline jurisdiction because of the relatively small size of Angle Lake.

B.    General Policies.

1.    Proposals for shoreline stabilization activities should address the impact of these activities on the shoreline environment. This planning should consider off-site erosion, accretion, or damage that might occur as a result of shoreline stabilization structures or activities.

2.    Explore a range of solutions to reduce the amount of bulkheads and shoreline armoring over time around Angle Lake and restore natural bank conditions. Alternative methods to typical shoreline armoring using native vegetation and other natural shoreline features should be the preferred method where feasible.

3.    Non-structural stabilization measures are preferred over “soft” structural measures. Soft structural shoreline stabilization measures are strongly preferred over hard structural shoreline stabilization. Proposals for hard and soft structural solutions, including bulkheads, should be allowed only when it is demonstrated that nonstructural methods are not feasible. Hard structural shoreline stabilization measures should be allowed only when it is demonstrated that soft structural measures are not feasible.

4.    Structural shoreline stabilization should be permitted only when it has been demonstrated that shoreline stabilization is necessary for the protection of existing legally established structures, primary uses and public improvements, and that there are no other feasible options to the proposed shoreline stabilization that have less impact on the shoreline environment.

5.    Shoreline stabilization structures should be located, designed and constructed to minimize adverse impact on the property of others.

6.    New development requiring bulkheads or similar protection should not be allowed. All new shoreline development should be located and designed to prevent or minimize the need for shoreline modification activities.

7.    Mitigation for shoreline stabilization should be provided to achieve no net loss of ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources.

C.    Regulations.

1.    General Shoreline Stabilization – New Development.

a.    New development, including the division of land into new parcels, shall, where feasible, be located and designed to eliminate the need for concurrent or future shoreline stabilization. New non-water-dependent development that would require shoreline stabilization that would cause significant adverse impacts to adjacent or down-current properties is prohibited.

b.    New development, including single-family residences, that includes structural shoreline stabilization will not be allowed unless all of the conditions below are met:

i.    The need to protect the development from damage due to erosion caused by natural processes, such as currents and waves, and by manmade processes, such as boat wakes, is demonstrated through a geotechnical report.

ii.    The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as loss of vegetation and drainage.

iii.    Non-structural measures, such as placing the development farther from the shoreline, planting vegetation, low impact development measures, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient.

iv.    The stabilization structure will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

c.    New development on steep or unstable slopes shall be set back sufficiently to ensure that shoreline stabilization will not be needed during the life of the structure, as demonstrated by a geotechnical analysis prepared by a geotechnical engineer or related professional licensed and in good standing in the State of Washington.

2.    General Shoreline Stabilization – Basic Requirements. Structural solutions to reduce shoreline damage from erosion shall be allowed only after it is demonstrated through a geotechnical report that non-structural solutions would not provide sufficient protection to existing improvements. The geotechnical report shall evaluate the necessity of structural stabilization measures by estimating time frames and rates of erosion (damage within three (3) years), urgency of replacement, alternative solutions and other pertinent factors. Non-structural solutions include (but are not limited to) soil bioengineering, beach enhancement, alternative site designs, drainage improvements and increased building setbacks (for proposed structures).

3.    General Shoreline Stabilization – New or Expanded Measures. New structural stabilization measures and enlargement of existing structural stabilization measures shall be limited to the minimum size necessary and shall be permitted only when it has been conclusively demonstrated through scientific analysis that shoreline stabilization is necessary to protect existing primary structures, public improvements, ecological function restoration projects or hazardous substance remediation projects from erosion, and that nonstructural measures, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements is not feasible or not sufficient.

4.    General Shoreline Stabilization – Replacement and Repair. An existing shoreline stabilization structure shall not be replaced with a similar structure unless there is a demonstrated need to protect legally established principal uses or existing structures from erosion caused by currents or waves and a nonstructural measure is not feasible.

a.    Shoreline stabilization solutions developed to replace existing shoreline stabilization shall be placed along the same alignment as, or landward of, the shoreline stabilization being replaced, except as noted below.

b.    Where existing structural stabilization is replaced by non-structural shoreline stabilization using bioengineering techniques and results in a documented improvement of shoreline functions, such stabilization may be allowed waterward of the ordinary high water mark subject to State and Federal approvals.

5.    Shoreline Stabilization – Design Requirements.

a.    Shoreline stabilization and modification projects shall avoid and then minimize adverse impacts to the environment to the greatest extent feasible, and where such impacts cannot be avoided, mitigation shall be provided to achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

b.    Shoreline stabilization should not be used to create new or newly usable land.

c.    Shoreline stabilization shall not significantly interfere with normal surface and/or subsurface drainage into the water body.

d.    Shoreline stabilization shall be designed so as not to constitute a hazard to navigation and to not substantially interfere with visual access to the water.

e.    Shoreline stabilization shall be designed so as not to not cause a significant impact to adjacent properties, including the need for shoreline stabilization elsewhere.

f.    Professional design (as approved by the City) of all shoreline stabilization is required. All shoreline modification activities shall be in support of a permitted shoreline use that is in conformance with the provisions of this Master Program unless it can be demonstrated that such activities are necessary and in the public interest.

g.    All shoreline modification activities must comply with all other regulations as stipulated by State and Federal agencies, local tribes, or others that have jurisdiction.

h.    Alternative methods to typical shoreline armoring using native vegetation and other natural shoreline features shall be considered when replacing existing and constructing new shoreline stabilization solutions.

i.    Public access shall be required as part of publicly financed shoreline stabilization measures unless public access improvements would cause unavoidable health or safety hazards to the public, inherent and unavoidable security problems, unacceptable and unmitigable significant ecological impacts, unavoidable conflict with proposed use, or a cost that is disproportionate and unreasonable to the total long-term cost of the development.

6.    Beach Enhancement.

a.    Beach enhancement along Angle Lake may be permitted when the applicant has demonstrated that the project will not detrimentally interrupt littoral processes, redirect waves, current, or sediment to other shorelines, or adversely affect adjacent properties or habitat and all other standards of the SMP are followed.

b.    Beach enhancement is limited to the placement of no more than twenty-five (25) cubic yards of material below the ordinary high water mark. Proposals which exceed this threshold shall be subject to the requirements for shoreline fill in this article, shall require a conditional use permit and shall only be allowed in conjunction with a water-dependent or public use permitted by this Master Program, and for fisheries, aquaculture, or wildlife enhancement projects.

c.    Natural Beach Restoration/Enhancement Design Standards. Natural beach restoration/enhancement shall not:

i.    Extend waterward more than the minimum amount necessary to achieve the desired stabilization;

ii.    Disturb significant amounts of valuable shallow water fish/wildlife habitat without appropriate mitigation of the impacts.

d.    Natural Beach Restoration Construction Standards.

i.    The size and/or mix of new materials to be added to a beach shall be as similar as possible to that of the natural beach sediment, but large enough to resist normal current, wake, or wave action at the site.

ii.    The restored beach shall approximate, and may slightly exceed, the natural beach width, height, bulk or profile (but not as much as to create additional dry land).

e.    Beach enhancement is prohibited within fish and/or wildlife spawning, nesting, or breeding habitat that would be adversely affected by it and also where littoral drift of the enhancement materials would adversely affect adjacent spawning grounds or other areas of biological significance.

7.    Soil Bioengineering.

a.    All soil bioengineering projects shall use native plant materials appropriate to the specific area including trees, shrubs, and ground covers, unless demonstrated infeasible for the particular site.

b.    Unless environmentally sensitive area regulations apply, all cleared areas shall be replanted with native vegetation immediately following construction and irrigated (if necessary) to ensure that within three (3) years all vegetation is one hundred percent (100%) reestablished to achieve no net loss of ecological functions of the shoreline area. Areas that fail to adequately reestablish vegetation shall be replanted with approved plant materials until such time as the plantings are viable. Additional performance standards may be established by the Shoreline Administrator in administrative rules.

c.    Bank stabilization in the form of a vegetated buffer zone shall be maintained (e.g., weeding, watering, dead plant replacement) for a minimum of three (3) years. The buffer zone shall exclude activities that could disturb the site. Where determined necessary by the Shoreline Administrator, fencing may be required to ensure protection of buffer plantings.

d.    All construction and planting activities shall be scheduled to minimize impacts to water quality and fish and wildlife aquatic and upland habitat, and to optimize survival of new vegetation.

8.    Breakwaters. Breakwaters, jetties, and groins shall not be permitted.

9.    Bulkheads.

a.    Bulkhead design and development shall conform to all other applicable local, State, and Federal agency regulations, including regulations for shoreline stabilization in this article.

b.    On all shorelines, bulkheads shall not be placed waterward of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM), unless as provided below. In addition:

i.    On shorelines where no other bulkheads are adjacent, the construction of a bulkhead shall tie in with the contours of the adjoining shorelines, as feasible, such that the proposed bulkhead would not cause erosion of the adjoining properties.

ii.    Bulkheads may tie in flush with existing bulkheads on adjoining properties; provided, that the new bulkhead does not extend waterward of the OHWM, except that which is necessary to make the connection to the adjoining bulkhead. In such circumstances, the remaining portion of the bulkhead shall be placed landward of the existing OHWM such that no net loss of lake occurs and the design complies with all other regulations as stipulated by State and Federal agencies, local tribes, or others that have jurisdiction.

iii.    Replacement bulkheads shall not encroach waterward of the ordinary high water mark or existing structure unless the residence was occupied prior to January 1, 1992, and there are overriding safety or environmental concerns. In such cases, the replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure.

c.    Replacement bulkheads may be permitted if there is a demonstrated need to protect principal uses or structures from erosion caused by waves; provided, that:

i.    The replacement bulkhead is designed, located, sized, and constructed to assure no net loss of ecological functions.

ii.    The existing bulkhead is removed.

iii.    The proposal includes a report prepared by a geotechnical engineer or other qualified professional that evaluates the necessity of the bulkhead by estimating time frames and rates of erosion, urgency of replacement (within three (3) years), alternative solutions and other pertinent factors.

d.    New bulkheads shall be allowed only for existing structures when evidence is presented through a report prepared by a geotechnical engineer or other qualified professional that conclusively demonstrates that one (1) of the following conditions exists:

i.    Bulkheads are necessary to the operation and location of water-dependent and water-related activities consistent with this Master Program; provided, that all alternatives have proven infeasible (i.e., use relocation, use design, nonstructural shore stabilization options) and that such bulkheads meet other policies and regulations of this article; or

ii.    Serious wave erosion threatens an existing building(s) on upland property; and

iii.    Proposals for bulkheads have first demonstrated that use of natural materials and processes (soft structural solutions) and alternative site designs, including increased shoreline setbacks (nonstructural solutions), are either not feasible or will not provide the necessary protection for existing development.

e.    When a bulkhead is required at a public access site, provisions for safe access to the water shall be incorporated into bulkhead design.

f.    Stairs or other permitted structures may be built into a bulkhead, but shall not extend waterward of a bulkhead.

g.    Fill behind bulkheads shall be limited to an average of one (1) cubic yard per running foot of bulkhead. Any filling in excess of this amount shall be considered a regulated activity subject to the policies and regulations in this SMP pertaining to fill activities and the requirement for obtaining a shoreline substantial development permit. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 7.3)) 


18.05.420 Dredging and Fill

A.    Applicability. Although these activities may occur separately from one another, they are often all parts of the same shoreline modification process and are, therefore, considered together in the following policies and regulations.

1.    Dredging and Dredge Material Disposal. Dredging is the removal or displacement of earth or sediments such as gravel, sand, mud or silt and/or other materials or debris from any stream, or lake and associated shorelines, side channels, and wetlands. In a lake setting, dredging is normally done for specific purposes or uses such as deepening a navigational channel or obtaining bottom material.

Dredge material is disposed of on land or into water bodies and may be intended for the purpose of creating new or additional lands for other uses. Dredge spoil varies from clean river sand to organic sludge. While some of this material is deposited on land, a significant portion is dumped, intentionally or unintentionally, back into the water or immediately adjacent to the water.

Of all activities on shorelines, dredging poses one (1) of the greatest threats to water quality and aquatic life. In most cases, dredging occurs in shallow areas and may disturb the aquatic environment in the following ways: (a) temporary reduction of water clarity from suspended sediments, (b) loss of aquatic plants and animals by direct removal or from the sedimentation of suspended materials, (c) alteration of the nutrient and oxygen levels of the water column, and (d) suspension of toxic materials from the sediments into the water column.

2.    Fill. Fill is the placement of soil, sand, rock, gravel, sediment, earth retaining structure or other material to an area waterward of the OHWM, in wetlands, or on shorelands in a manner that raises the elevation or creates dry land.

Fill is usually considered in locations where the water is shallow and where rooted vegetation often occurs. In their natural condition, these same areas provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife feeding, breeding, and shelter. Biologically, the shallow vegetation areas tend to be highly productive portions of the lake. For these reasons, governmental agencies and scientific experts have generally sought to prohibit or restrict fill.

The policies contained herein are intended to focus on the aspects of natural systems affected by dredging and the disposal of dredge material, manmade fill, cuts, excavations and site grading actions, while at the same time recognizing the community’s needs.

B.    Policies.

1.    Dredging.

a.    Dredging should only be allowed as a conditional use in all shoreline environments. Dredging should be restricted to the minimum necessary to support water-dependent uses, for expansion or alteration of public utility facilities, and for environmental restoration and enhancement projects, and only when other solutions would result in greater environmental impact.

b.    Dredging waterward of the ordinary high water mark for the primary purpose of obtaining fill should not be allowed, except as part of a restoration or environmental cleanup project.

c.    In all cases, dredging operations should be planned and conducted to protect and maintain existing aquatic habitat and other shoreline uses, properties, and values.

d.    Dredging operations should be designed and scheduled to avoid impacts to fish, including impacts to fish rearing, feeding and spawning.

e.    Dredging and dredge material disposal should be located and conducted in a manner that minimizes damage to existing ecological values and natural resources of the area to be dredged and of the disposal site. Proposals that include dredging should provide mitigation to achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

f.    Dredge material disposal in water bodies should be prohibited.

g.    Dredging should utilize techniques that cause minimal dispersal and broadcast of bottom material should be utilized, such as hydraulic dredging instead of agitation dredging.

h.    The City may impose limitations on dredging activities, such as limited operating hours, time periods, and requirements for buffer strips at the site.

2.    Fill.

a.    Shoreline fill should be permitted as a conditional use in all shoreline environments.

b.    Fills waterward of the OHWM should be restricted to the minimum necessary to support water-dependent uses, public access, cleanup and disposal of contaminated sediments as part of an interagency cleanup plan, disposal of dredged sediments in accordance with Department of Natural Resources (DNR) rules, expansion or alteration of transportation facilities of statewide significance when no other alternatives are feasible, and for mitigation actions, environmental restoration and enhancement projects, and only when other solutions would result in greater environmental impact.

c.    Shoreline fills should be designed and located so that there will be no significant damage to existing ecological systems or natural resources, and no alteration of local currents, surface and subsurface drainage, or flood waters which would result in hazard to adjacent life, property, or natural resource systems.

d.    Where permitted, fill coverage should be the minimum necessary to provide for the proposed use. Fills should be permitted only when tied to a specific development proposal that is permitted by the Master Program.

e.    In evaluating fill projects, factors such as current and potential public use of the shoreline and water surface area, water flow and drainage, water quality and habitat should be considered and protected to the maximum extent feasible. Further, the City should assess the overall value of the fill site in its present state versus the proposed shoreline use to be created to ensure consistency with the Shoreline Management Act and this Master Program.

f.    The perimeter of fills should be designed to avoid or eliminate erosion and sedimentation impacts, both during initial fill activities and over time. Natural appearing and self-sustaining control methods are preferred over structural methods.

g.    Replenishing sand and gravel on public and private beaches should be allowed, if it can be demonstrated that the proposal will result in no net loss of ecological functions.

h.    Sanitary landfills should not be located in shoreline jurisdiction.

C.    Regulations.

1.    Dredging.

a.    Dredging and disposal of dredge material shall avoid, and minimize, significant ecological impact; impacts that cannot be avoided shall be mitigated to achieve no net loss of ecological processes and functions.

b.    New development siting and design shall avoid the need for new and maintenance dredging.

c.    Dredging may be permitted as a conditional use activity only:

i.    When necessary to support a water-dependent use;

ii.    For expansion or alteration of public utility facilities;

iii.    As part of mitigation actions, environmental restoration and habitat enhancement projects;

iv.    When technical information demonstrates water circulation, littoral drift, aquatic life and water quality will not be substantially impaired;

v.    When other solutions would result in greater environmental impact;

vi.    As part of an approved habitat improvement project;

vii.    If it improves water quality; and

viii.    When applicable permits of other local, State and Federal agencies have been obtained.

d.    When dredging is permitted, the extent of dredging shall be the minimum necessary to accommodate the proposed use.

e.    Maintenance dredging associated with a water-dependent use shall be restricted to maintaining the previously dredged and/or existing authorized location, depth and width.

f.    Dredging for the primary purpose of obtaining fill or construction material is prohibited, except for projects associated with MTCA or CERCLA habitat restoration, or any other significant restoration effort approved by a shoreline conditional use permit. When dredging is allowed for fill materials, placement of fill must be waterward of the OHWM.

g.    Proposals for dredging and dredge disposal shall include details on all feasible mitigation measures to protect aquatic habitats. Dredging and dredge disposal shall not create a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

h.    Dredging material which will not subsequently cause violation of State water quality standards may be used in permitted landfill projects.

i.    Excavations on beaches below the OHWM in lands covered by water constitute dredging and shall include precautions to prevent the migration of fine grain sediments, disturbed by the excavation, onto adjacent beach areas. Excavations on beaches shall be backfilled promptly using material of similar composition and similar or coarser grain size.

j.    Dredging shall be timed so that it does not interfere with aquatic life.

k.    Depositing dredge materials in water areas shall be prohibited.

l.    Dredging shall utilize techniques (such as hydraulic dredging instead of agitation dredging) that cause minimal dispersal and broadcast of bottom material.

m.    Limitations may be imposed on dredging activities, such as limited operating hours, time periods, and requirements for buffer strips at the site.

2.    Fill.

a.    Fills waterward of the OHWM (not including small scale beach restoration that does not exceed the twenty-five (25) cubic yard threshold established in SMC 18.05.410(C)(6)(b)) shall require a conditional use and shall be restricted to the minimum necessary to:

i.    Support water-dependent uses;

ii.    Provide public access;

iii.    Allow for the remediation and disposal of contaminated sediments as part of an interagency cleanup plan;

iv.    Allow the disposal of dredged sediments in accordance with DNR rules;

v.    Provide for the expansion or alteration of transportation facilities of statewide significance when no other alternatives are feasible; and

b.    Fills shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent, minimize, and control all material movement, erosion, and sedimentation from the affected area.

c.    All perimeters of fills shall be provided with vegetation, retaining walls, or other satisfactory mechanisms for erosion prevention and sediment capture.

d.    Fill proposals must demonstrate, at a minimum, that they will result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

e.    Fill shall be permitted only where it is demonstrated that the proposed action will not:

i.    Result in significant damage to water quality, fish, aquatic habitat, and/or wildlife habitat; or

ii.    Adversely alter natural drainage and circulation patterns, or significantly reduce flood water holding capabilities.

f.    No refuse disposal sites, solid waste disposal sites, or sanitary fills shall be permitted along the Angle Lake shoreline.

g.    Any placement or removal of materials landward of the OHWM shall comply with the provisions of SMC 18.05.240, Vegetation Conservation (Clearing and Grading). (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 7.4)) 


18.05.430 Overwater Structures – Piers, Docks, Floats and Buoys

A.    Applicability. Piers and docks are structures which abut the shoreline and are often used as a landing or moorage place for watercraft. Piers are built on fixed platforms supported by piles above the water, while docks float upon the water. Some piers may terminate in a float section that is connected by a ramp.

Recreational floats are independent anchored off-shore platforms, used for water-dependent recreational activities such as swimming and diving.

Certain mooring structures such as moorage piles, buoys and boat lifts are not generally used on Angle Lake since an eight (8) mph speed limit and a “no wake rule” generally result in only small craft using the lake.

All of these types of facilities have positive and negative environmental aspects. Floating docks generally have less of a visual impact than piers on pilings. However, in the nearshore, docks can interrupt littoral drift of sediments and other suspended materials, and significantly shade the aquatic environment throughout their length. Pile piers can provide diverse habitat for both desirable and undesirable aquatic life. Excavated moorage involves dredging and will disturb bottom sediments and aquatic life. Docks and piers alike create impediments to boat traffic and fish travel. Pier construction requires regulation to protect navigation, to protect shoreline aesthetics, and to maintain the usable water surface and aquatic lands for life forms characteristic and important to those areas.

B.    Exemptions. The City will review all development proposals for piers to determine if:

1.    The proposal is or is not exempt from the requirement for a substantial development permit per SMC 18.05.470(D);

2.    The proposal is suitably located and designed and that all potential impacts have been recognized and mitigated such that there is no net loss of shoreline ecological functions; and

3.    The proposal is consistent with the intent, policies, and regulations of the Act, RCW 90.58.10(12), and this Master Program.

C.    Policies.

1.    New piers and docks should be allowed only for public access and water-dependent uses.

2.    New piers and docks should be restricted to the minimum size necessary and permitted only when the applicant has demonstrated that a specific need exists to support the intended water-dependent use.

3.    Piers and docks should be discouraged where conflicts with recreational boaters and other recreational water activities would be created by pier construction.

4.    The further proliferation of single-purpose, single-owner piers and docks should be discouraged. Preference should be given to the shared use piers in shoreline areas by requiring a conditional use permit in the Shoreline Residential environment for piers and docks serving one (1) dwelling unit, allowing joint use structures as a permitted use in the Shoreline Residential environment and requiring shared use docks and piers in all other environments.

5.    A pile-supported walkway should only be allowed within the Urban Conservancy and High-Intensity shoreline environments. Mitigation should be required to ensure no net loss of ecological functions.

6.    Substantial additions or alterations to overwater structures, including renovations where the cost of the development exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the existing structure, should be in conformance with all policies and regulations set forth in this Master Program.

7.    Preference should be given to fixed-pile piers elevated above the OHWM. Floating docks should be allowed if the applicant can demonstrate why a fixed-pile pier is not feasible or will result in greater impacts.

8.    Recreational floats should be allowed where they are intended to support public or private recreational uses, or in lieu of fixed piers adjacent to residential land uses.

9.    New moorage covers should not be allowed.

10.    Overwater structures, including piers, should only be authorized after consideration of:

a.    The effect such structures have on wildlife and aquatic life, water quality, scenic and aesthetic values, environmental sensitive resources, submerged lands, and submerged vegetation.

b.    The effect such structures have on water circulation, recreational boating, sediment movement and littoral drift and shoreline access.

11.    Overwater structures and mooring buoys should be designed to cause minimum interference with navigable waters and the public’s safe use of the lake and shoreline.

12.    Use of non-reflective materials in construction should be encouraged.

13.    The proposed size of the structure and intensity of use or uses of any overwater structure should be compatible with the surrounding environment and land and water uses.

14.    Lighting facilities should be limited to the minimum extent necessary to locate the pier or dock at night.

D.    Regulations.

1.    General.

a.    All new, reconstructed, repaired, or modified overwater structures must comply with all regulations contained in this SMP and all other regulations as stipulated by State and Federal agencies, local tribes, or others that have jurisdiction.

b.    Mitigation shall be provided for all reconstructed, repaired, or modified overwater structures to ensure no net loss of ecological function.

c.    New piers and docks shall be allowed only for public access and water-dependent uses, which includes a structure associated with a single-family residence; provided, that it is designed and intended as a facility for access to watercraft and otherwise complies with the regulations contained in this section.

d.    New piers and docks that are not accessory to single-family residences shall be permitted only when intended for public use or when the applicant has demonstrated that a specific need exists to support the intended water-dependent use.

e.    New residential development of more than two (2) dwellings shall provide a joint use or community moorage structure, rather than individual piers or docks.

f.    New piers and docks associated with a single-family home shall be allowed, provided the applicant demonstrates that a joint use or community pier is not feasible.

g.    New proposed moorage structures in the Shoreline Residential environment that are not joint use structures must obtain a conditional use permit. Additional restrictions apply for some shoreline environments pursuant to Table III. A conditional use permit may be granted if:

i.    The applicant demonstrates that a joint use or community moorage structure is not feasible;

Requirements to obtain a substantial development permit, conditional use permit, variance, letter of exemption, or other review to implement the Shoreline Management Act do not apply to the developments identified in WAC 173-27-044 and 173-27-045. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 8.3)) 


18.05.470 Shoreline Permits and Exemptions

A.    All uses and developments occurring within shoreline jurisdiction shall be compliant with Chapter 90.58 RCW.

B.    A substantial shoreline development permit is required per the following guidelines:

1.    A development, use, or activity shall not be undertaken within the jurisdiction of the SMA, Chapter 90.58 RCW, and this Shoreline Master Program unless it is consistent with the policy and procedures of the SMA, applicable State regulations and this Shoreline Master Program.

2.    A substantial development shall not be undertaken within the jurisdiction of the SMA, Chapter 90.58 RCW, and this Shoreline Master Program unless a shoreline substantial development permit has been obtained and the appeal period has been completed and any appeals have been resolved and/or the applicant has been given permission to proceed by the proper authority.

C.    The following guidelines are to be used in determining whether or not a development proposal is exempt from the substantial shoreline development permit:

1.    Exemptions shall be construed narrowly. Only those developments that meet the precise terms of one (1) or more of the listed exemptions may be granted exemption from the substantial development permit process.

2.    An exemption from the substantial development permit process is not an exemption from compliance with the Shoreline Management Act or this Shoreline Master Program, nor from any other regulatory requirements. To be authorized, all uses and developments must be consistent with the policies and provisions of this Shoreline Master Program and the Shoreline Management Act. A development or use that is listed as a conditional use pursuant to this Shoreline Master Program or is an unlisted use must obtain a conditional use permit even though the development or use does not require a substantial development permit. When a development or use is proposed that does not comply with the bulk, dimensional and performance standards of this Shoreline Master Program, such development or use can only be authorized by approval of a variance.

3.    The burden of proof that a development or use is exempt from the permit process is on the applicant.

4.    If any part of a proposed development is not eligible for exemption, then a substantial development permit is required for the entire proposed development project.

5.    The City’s Shoreline Administrator may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments and/or uses as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Shoreline Management Act and this Shoreline Master Program.

D.    Exemptions.

1.    Developments which are exempt from requirements for a substantial development permit are identified in WAC 173-27-040 or as subsequently amended. The following is a short summary of the types of developments which do not require substantial development permits (see WAC 173-27-040 for detailed descriptions):

a.    Any development of which the total cost or fair market value, whichever is higher, does not exceed seven thousand forty-seven ($7,047) dollars, if such development does not materially interfere with the normal public use of the water or “shorelines of statewide significance.” The dollar threshold established in this subsection must be adjusted for inflation by the Office of Financial Management every five (5) years, beginning July 1, 2007, based upon changes in the consumer price index during that time period. “Consumer price index” means, for any calendar year, that year’s annual average consumer price index, Seattle, Washington area, for urban wage earners and clerical workers, all items, compiled by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, United States Department of Labor. The Office of Financial Management must calculate the new dollar threshold and transmit it to the Office of the Code Reviser for publication in the Washington State Register at least one (1) month before the new dollar threshold is to take effect. For purposes of determining whether or not a permit is required, the total cost or fair market value shall be based on the value of development that is occurring on “shorelines of statewide significance.” The total cost or fair market value of the development shall include the fair market value of any donated, contributed or found labor, equipment or materials;

b.    Normal maintenance or repair of existing structures or developments, including damage by accident, fire, or elements. “Normal maintenance” includes those usual acts to prevent a decline, lapse, or cessation from a lawfully established condition. “Normal repair” means to restore a development to a state comparable to its original condition within a reasonable period after decay or partial destruction, except where repair causes substantial adverse effects to the shoreline resource or environment. Replacement of a structure or development may be authorized as repair where such replacement is the common method of repair for the type of structure or development and the replacement structure or development is comparable to the original structure or development including, but not limited to, its size, shape, configuration, location and external appearance and the replacement does not cause substantial adverse effects to shoreline resources or environment;

c.    Construction of a normal protective bulkhead common to single-family residences. A “normal protective bulkhead” includes those structural and nonstructural developments installed at or near, and parallel to, the ordinary high water mark for the sole purpose of protecting an existing single-family residence and appurtenant structures from loss or damage by erosion. A normal protective bulkhead is not exempt if constructed for the purpose of creating dry land. When a vertical or near vertical wall is being constructed or reconstructed, not more than one (1) cubic yard of fill per one (1) foot of wall may be used as backfill. When an existing bulkhead is being repaired by construction of a vertical wall fronting the existing wall, it shall be constructed no further waterward of the existing bulkhead than is necessary for construction of new footings. When a bulkhead has deteriorated such that an ordinary high water mark has been established by the presence and action of water landward of the bulkhead, then the replacement bulkhead must be located at or near the actual ordinary high water mark. Beach nourishment and bioengineered erosion control projects may be considered a normal protective bulkhead when any structural elements are consistent with the above requirements and when the project has been approved by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife;

d.    Emergency construction necessary to protect property from damage by the elements. An “emergency” is an unanticipated and imminent threat to public health, safety, or the environment which requires immediate action within a time too short to allow full compliance with the Act or this Master Program. Emergency construction does not include development of new permanent protective structures where none previously existed. Where new protective structures are deemed by the Shoreline Administrator to be the appropriate means to address the emergency situation, upon abatement of the emergency situation the new structure shall be removed or any permit which would have been required, absent an emergency, pursuant to the Act and this Master Program, obtained. All emergency construction shall be consistent with the policies of the Act and this Master Program. As a general matter, flooding or other seasonal events that can be anticipated and may occur but that are not imminent are not an emergency;

e.    Construction by an owner, lessee, or contract purchaser of a single-family residence for their own use or for the use of their family, which residence does not exceed a height of thirty-five (35) feet above average grade level and meets all requirements of the City of SeaTac having jurisdiction thereof, other than requirements imposed pursuant to the Act. “Single-family residence” means a detached dwelling designed for and occupied by one (1) family including those structures and developments within a contiguous ownership which are a normal appurtenance. An “appurtenance” is necessarily connected to the use and enjoyment of a single-family residence and is located landward of the ordinary high water mark and the perimeter of a wetland. Normal appurtenances include a garage, deck, driveway, utilities, fences, installation of a septic tank and drainfield, and grading which does not exceed two hundred fifty (250) cubic yards and which does not involve placement of fill in any wetland or waterward of the ordinary high water mark. Construction authorized under this exemption shall be located landward of the ordinary high water mark and shall be subject to required setbacks;

f.    Construction of a dock, including a community dock, designed for pleasure craft only, for the private noncommercial use of the owner, lessee, or contract purchaser of single-family and multi-family residences. A dock is a landing and moorage facility for watercraft and does not include recreational decks, storage facilities or other appurtenances. This exception applies if the fair market value of the dock does not exceed: (i) twenty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($22,500) for docks that are constructed to replace existing docks, are of equal or lesser square footage than the existing dock being replaced; or (ii) eleven thousand two hundred dollars ($11,200) for all other docks constructed in fresh waters. However, if subsequent construction occurs within five (5) years of completion of the prior construction and the combined fair market value of the subsequent and prior construction exceeds the amount specified above, the subsequent construction shall be considered a substantial development for the purpose of this article;

g.    The marking of property lines or corners on State owned lands, when such marking does not significantly interfere with the normal public use of the surface waters;

h.    Any project with certification from the Governor pursuant to Chapter 80.50 RCW;

i.    Site exploration and investigation activities that are prerequisite to preparation of an application for development authorization under this article, if:

i.    The activity does not interfere with the normal public use of the surface waters;

ii.    The activity will have no significant adverse impact on the environment including but not limited to fish, wildlife, fish or wildlife habitat, water quality, and aesthetic values;

iii.    The activity does not involve the installation of any structure, and upon completion of the activity the vegetation and land configuration of the site are restored to conditions existing before the activity;

iv.    A private entity seeking development authorization under this section first posts a performance bond or provides other evidence of financial responsibility to the local jurisdiction to ensure that the site is restored to preexisting conditions;

j.    The process of removing or controlling aquatic noxious weeds, as defined in RCW 17.26.020, through the use of an herbicide or other treatment methods applicable to weed control that are recommended by a final environmental impact statement published by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Ecology jointly with other State agencies under Chapter 43.21C RCW;

k.    Watershed restoration projects as defined in WAC 173-27-040. The Shoreline Administrator shall review the projects for consistency with the Shoreline Master Program in an expeditious manner and shall issue its decision along with any conditions within forty-five (45) days of receiving all materials necessary to review the request for exemption from the applicant. No fee may be charged for accepting and processing requests for exemption for watershed restoration projects;

l.    Consistent with WAC 173-27-040, a public or private project designed to improve fish or wildlife habitat or fish passage, that conforms to the provisions of RCW 77.55.181;

m.    The external or internal retrofitting of an existing structure with the exclusive purpose of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq.) or to otherwise provide physical access to the structure by individuals with disabilities.

2.    Whenever a development falls within the exemption criteria outlined above and the development is subject to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 10 or Section 404 Permit, the City’s Shoreline Administrator shall prepare a statement of exemption, and transmit a copy to the applicant and the Washington State Department of Ecology. Exempt development as defined herein shall not require a substantial development permit, but may require a conditional use permit, variance and/or a statement of exemption.

3.    Before determining that a proposal is exempt, the City’s Shoreline Administrator may conduct a site inspection to ensure that the proposal meets the exemption criteria. The exemption granted may be conditioned to ensure that the activity is consistent with the Master Program and the Shoreline Management Act.

4.    Note: EXEMPTION FROM SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIREMENTS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE EXEMPTION FROM THE POLICIES AND USE REGULATIONS OF THE SHORELINE MANAGEMENT ACT; THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MASTER PROGRAM; AND OTHER APPLICABLE CITY, STATE, OR FEDERAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.

E.    Permit Application Requirements. A complete application for a substantial development, conditional use, or variance permit shall contain, as a minimum, the following information:

1.    The name, address and phone number of the applicant. The applicant should be the owner of the property or the primary proponent of the project and not the representative of the owner or primary proponent.

2.    The name, address and phone number of the applicant’s representative if other than the applicant.

3.    The name, address and phone number of the property owner, if other than the applicant.

4.    Location of the property. This shall, at a minimum, include the property address and identification of the section, township and range to the nearest quarter, quarter section or latitude and longitude to the nearest minute. All applications for projects located in open water areas away from land shall provide a longitude and latitude location.

5.    Identification of the name of the shoreline (water body) that the site of the proposal is associated with. This should be the water body from which jurisdiction of the Act over the project is derived.

6.    A general description of the proposed project that includes the proposed use or uses and the activities necessary to accomplish the project.

7.    A general description of the property as it now exists including its physical characteristics and improvements and structures.

8.    A general description of the vicinity of the proposed project including identification of the adjacent uses, structures and improvements, intensity of development and physical characteristics.

9.    A site development plan consisting of maps and elevation drawings, drawn to an appropriate scale to depict clearly all required information, photographs and text which shall include:

a.    The boundary of the parcel(s) of land upon which the development is proposed.

b.    The ordinary high water mark of all water bodies located adjacent to or within the boundary of the project. This may be an approximate location; provided, that for any development where a determination of consistency with the applicable regulations requires a precise location of the ordinary high water mark the mark shall be located precisely and the biological and hydrological basis for the location as indicated on the plans shall be included in the development plan. Where the ordinary high water mark is neither adjacent to nor within the boundary of the project, the plan shall indicate the distance and direction to the nearest ordinary high water mark of a shoreline.

c.    Existing and proposed land contours. The contours shall be at intervals sufficient to accurately determine the existing character of the property and the extent of proposed change to the land that is necessary for the development. Areas within the boundary that will not be altered by the development may be indicated as such and contours approximated for that area.

d.    A delineation of all wetland areas that will be altered or used as a part of the development.

e.    A general indication of the character of vegetation found on the site.

f.    The dimensions and locations of all existing and proposed structures and improvements including but not limited to: buildings, paved or graveled areas, roads, utilities, septic tanks and drainfields, material stockpiles or surcharge, and stormwater management facilities.

g.    Where applicable, a landscaping plan for the project.

h.    Where applicable, plans for development of areas on or off the site as mitigation for impacts associated with the proposed project shall be included and contain information consistent with the requirements of this section.

i.    Quantity, source and composition of any fill material that is placed on the site whether temporary or permanent.

j.    Quantity, composition and destination of any excavated or dredged material.

k.    A vicinity map showing the relationship of the property and proposed development or use to roads, utilities, existing developments and uses on adjacent properties.

l.    Where applicable, a depiction of the impacts to views from existing residential uses and public areas.

m.    On all variance applications the plans shall clearly indicate where development could occur without approval of a variance, the physical features and circumstances on the property that provide a basis for the request, and the location of adjacent structures and uses.

F.    Review Criteria for All Development.

1.    No authorization to undertake use or development on shorelines of the State shall be granted by the local government unless upon review the use or development is determined to be consistent with the policy and provisions of the Shoreline Management Act and the Master Program.

2.    No permit shall be issued for any new or expanded building or structure of more than thirty-five (35) feet above average grade level on shorelines of the State that will obstruct the view of a substantial number of residences on areas adjoining such shorelines except where a master program does not prohibit the same and then only when overriding considerations of the public interest will be served.

3.    Special Procedures for WSDOT Projects.

a.    Permit Review Time for Projects on a State Highway. Pursuant to RCW 47.01.485, the Legislature established target of ninety (90) days’ review time for local governments.

b.    Optional Process Allowing Construction to Commence Twenty-One (21) Days after Date of Filing. Pursuant to RCW 90.58.140, Washington State Department of Transportation projects that address significant public safety risks may begin twenty-one (21) days after the date of filing if all components of the project will achieve no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

G.    Review Criteria for Substantial Development Permits.

1.    A substantial development permit shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with:

a.    The policies and procedures of the Act;

b.    The provisions of this regulation; and

c.    The applicable master program adopted or approved for the area. Provided, that where no master program has been approved for an area, the development shall be reviewed for consistency with the provisions of Chapter 173-26 WAC and, to the extent feasible, any draft or approved master program which can be reasonably ascertained as representing the policy of the local government.

2.    Local government may attach conditions to the approval of permits as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the Act and the local master program.

H.    Variances and Conditional Use Permits. The Shoreline Management Act states that master programs shall contain provisions covering variances and conditional uses that are consistent with Chapter 173-27 WAC. These provisions should be applied in a manner which, while protecting the environment, will assure that a person will be able to use his/her property in a fair and equitable manner.

1.    Variances. The purpose of a variance is strictly limited to granting relief to specific bulk, dimensional, or performance standards set forth in the Master Program, and where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the property such that the strict implementation of the Master Program would impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the SMA policies as stated in RCW 90.58.020.

Construction pursuant to this permit shall not begin nor can construction be authorized except as provided in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances, extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

a.    Application. An application for a shoreline variance shall be submitted on a form provided by the City accompanied by maps, completed environmental checklist, applicable fees, and any other information specified in this Master Program or requested by the Administrator. An applicant for a substantial development permit who wishes to request a variance shall submit the variance application and the substantial development permit application simultaneously.

b.    Criteria for Granting Variances. Variances for development that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark and landward of any wetland may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the following variance criteria as listed in WAC 173-27-170:

i.    That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional, or performance standards set forth in the Master Program precludes, or significantly interferes with, reasonable use of the property.

ii.    That the hardship described above is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of the Master Program and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant’s own actions.

iii.    That the design of the project is compatible with other permitted activities within the area and with uses planned for the area under the Comprehensive Plan and Master Program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment.

iv.    That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area.

v.    That the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief.

vi.    That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

c.    Variances for a development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the ordinary high water mark or within any wetland may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

i.    That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional, or performance standards set forth in the Master Program precludes all reasonable use of the property.

ii.    That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsection (H)(1)(b) of this section.

iii.    That the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected.

d.    In the granting of all variances, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments and/or uses in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

e.    Variances from the use regulations of the Master Program are prohibited.

2.    Conditional Uses. The purpose of a conditional use permit is to provide a system within the Master Program which allows flexibility in the application of use regulations in a manner consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020. In authorizing a conditional use, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the City of SeaTac or the Department of Ecology to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use and/or to assure consistency of the project with the Act and the Master Program. Uses that are specifically prohibited by this Master Program may not be authorized with the approval of a conditional use permit.

a.    Criteria for Granting Shoreline Conditional Use Permits. Uses which are classified or set forth as conditional uses in the Master Program may be authorized, provided the applicant demonstrate all of the following conditional use criteria as listed in WAC 173-27-160:

i.    That the proposed use is consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the Master Program;

ii.    That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines;

iii.    That the proposed use of the site and design of the project are compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the Comprehensive Plan and this Master Program;

iv.    That the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and

v.    That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.

b.    In the granting of all conditional use permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

c.    Other uses which are not classified or set forth in this Master Program may be authorized as conditional uses provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this section and the requirements for conditional uses contained in the Master Program.

d.    Uses which are specifically prohibited by the Master Program may not be authorized.

I.    Time Requirements of Permit.

1.    The time requirements of this section shall apply to all substantial development permits and to any development authorized pursuant to a variance or conditional use permit authorized by this article. Upon a finding of good cause, based on the requirements and circumstances of the project proposed and consistent with the policy and provisions of the Master Program and this article, local government may adopt different time limits from those set forth in subsections (I)(2) and (I)(3) of this section as a part of action on a substantial development permit.

2.    Construction activities shall be commenced or, where no construction activities are involved, the use or activity shall be commenced within two (2) years of the effective date of a substantial development permit. However, local government may authorize a single extension for a period not to exceed one (1) year based on reasonable factors, if a request for extension has been filed before the expiration date and notice of the proposed extension is given to parties of record on the substantial development permit and to the Department.

3.    Authorization to conduct development activities shall terminate five (5) years after the effective date of a substantial development permit. However, local government may authorize a single extension for a period not to exceed one (1) year based on reasonable factors, if a request for extension has been filed before the expiration date and notice of the proposed extension is given to parties of record and to the Department.

4.    The effective date of a substantial development permit shall be the date of filing as provided in RCW 90.58.140(6). The permit time periods in subsections (I)(2) and (I)(3) of this section do not include the time during which a use or activity was not actually pursued due to the pendency of administrative appeals or legal actions or due to the need to obtain any other government permits and approvals for the development that authorize the development to proceed, including all reasonably related administrative or legal actions on any such permits or approvals.

5.    Revisions to permits under WAC 173-27-100 may be authorized after original permit authorization has expired; provided, that this procedure shall not be used to extend the original permit time requirements or to authorize substantial development after the time limits of the original permit.

6.    Local government shall notify the Department in writing of any change to the effective date of a permit, as authorized by this section, with an explanation of the basis for approval of the change. Any change to the time limits of a permit other than those authorized by RCW 90.58.143 as amended shall require a new permit application. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 8.4)) 


18.05.480 Nonconforming Use and Development Standards

“Nonconforming use or development” means a shoreline use or development which was lawfully constructed or established prior to the effective date of the Act or this Master Program, or amendments thereto, but which does not conform to present regulations or standards of this Master Program. In such cases, the following standards shall apply:

A.    Structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use, but which are nonconforming with regard to setbacks, buffers or yards; area; bulk; height or density, may be maintained and repaired and may be enlarged or expanded; provided, that said enlargement does not increase the extent of nonconformity by further encroaching upon or extending into areas where construction or use would not be allowed for new development or uses.

B.    Uses and developments that were legally established and are nonconforming with regard to the use regulations of the Master Program may continue as legal nonconforming uses. Such uses shall not be enlarged or expanded.

C.    A use which is listed as a conditional use, but which existed prior to adoption of the Master Program or any relevant amendment and for which a conditional use permit has not been obtained, shall be considered a nonconforming use. A use which is listed as a conditional use, but which existed prior to the applicability of the Master Program to the site and for which a conditional use permit has not been obtained, shall be considered a nonconforming use.

D.    A structure for which a variance has been issued shall be considered a legal nonconforming structure and the requirements of this section shall apply as they apply to preexisting nonconformities.

E.    A structure which is being or has been used for a nonconforming use may be used for a different nonconforming use only upon the approval of a conditional use permit. A conditional use permit may be approved only upon a finding that:

1.    No reasonable alternative conforming use is practical; and

2.    The proposed use will be at least as consistent with the policies and provisions of the Act and the Master Program and as compatible with the uses in the area as the preexisting use.

3.    In addition, such conditions may be attached to the permit as are deemed necessary to assure compliance with the above findings, the requirements of the Master Program and the Shoreline Management Act and to assure that the use will not become a nuisance or a hazard.

a.    A nonconforming structure which is moved any distance must be brought into conformance with the Master Program and the Act.

b.    Modification or addition to a nonconforming structure shall not increase the building footprint lying within the above described setback area.

c.    If a nonconforming structure is intentionally modified and the cost of the proposed development exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the replacement cost of the original structure, it shall be required to meet all applicable standards in the SMP.

d.    If a nonconforming structure is unintentionally damaged to an extent not exceeding seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value of the replacement cost of the original structure, it may be reconstructed to those configurations existing immediately prior to the time the structure was damaged; provided, that application is made for the permits necessary to restore the structure within six (6) months of the date the damage occurred, all permits are obtained and the restoration is completed within two (2) years of permit issuance.

F.    A nonconforming use may be reestablished as a nonconformance, except that any nonconforming use that is discontinued for a period of six (6) continuous months shall not be reestablished. Any nonconforming use of a building which is discontinued for a total of one (1) year (twelve (12) months) over a three (3) year period shall not be allowed to continue as the nonconforming use.

G.    An undeveloped lot, tract, parcel, site, or division of land located landward of the ordinary high water mark which was established prior to the effective date of the Act or the Master Program, but which does not conform to the present lot size standards, may be developed if permitted by other land use regulations of the local government and so long as such development conforms to all other requirements of the Master Program and the Act. (Ord. 19-1015 § 2 (Exh. A § 8.5)) 


18.05.490 Appeal to the State Shorelines Hearings Board
