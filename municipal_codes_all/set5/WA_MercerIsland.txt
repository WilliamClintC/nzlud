2.14.060     Exemptions.
2.14.070     Fees.

2.14.010 Authority and purpose.
A. The Washington State Public Records Act (Act), Chapter 42.56 RCW, requires the city of Mercer Island (city) to make available for inspection and copying public records in accordance with the city’s published rules. The Act defines “public record” as any “writing containing information relating to the conduct of government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared, owned, used, or retained” regardless of physical form or characteristics.
B. The city manager is authorized to establish a Public Records Act policy to adopt reasonable rules, consistent with the intent of the Act and the Model Rules in Chapter 44-14 WAC, that provide the public full access to public records with “fullest assistance” to requesters and the “most timely possible action on requests,” while protecting public records from damage and disorganization, preventing excessive interference with other essential functions of the city, and withholding certain public records from disclosure subject to various legal exemptions. (Ord. 18C-01 § 1).

2.14.020 Adopted by reference.
Chapter 42.56 RCW, as presently written and as it may be hereafter amended, shall be and is hereby adopted by reference. The city shall rely on the Washington State Attorney General’s Model Rules on Public Disclosure (Chapter 44-14 WAC) as adopted or hereafter amended, as guidance on complying with Chapter 42.56 RCW. (Ord. 18C-01 § 1).

2.14.030 Public records officer.
A. The city manager shall designate a public records officer to oversee the city’s compliance with the public records requirements of this chapter and Chapter 42.56 RCW. The public records officer may delegate the duties and responsibilities of complying with a public records request to another city employee. The officer’s responsibilities will be contained in the city’s PRA rules.
B. The public records officer shall complete Public Records Act and records retention training as set forth in RCW 42.56.152. (Ord. 18C-01 § 1).

2.14.040 Scope of rules authorized.
A. As required by the Act, the public records officer has established the City of Mercer Island Public Records Act Rules of Procedure (PRA rules) and is authorized to amend the PRA rules as needed.
B. The PRA rules shall set forth the procedure for making, responding to, inspecting, and copying records requests; protecting records from damage or disorganization; preventing excess interference with Mercer Island’s other essential functions; providing “fullest assistance” to requesters and the “most timely” possible action on requests.
C. The PRA rules are posted on the city’s website at www.mercergov.org/prr. (Ord. 18C-01 § 1).

2.14.050 Indexing of records.
The city manager shall declare that maintaining a central index of city records is unduly burdensome, costly, and would interfere with city operations due to the number and complexity of records generated as a result of a wide range of city activities. (Ord. 18C-01 § 1).

2.14.060 Exemptions.
The Public Records Act provides that a number of documents and information are exempt from public inspection and copying. These exemptions are found in Chapter 42.56 RCW and other statutes outside of the Act that may prohibit disclosure of specific information or records. (Ord. 18C-01 § 1).

2.14.070 Fees.
A. Pursuant to RCW 42.56.120(b), the city has determined it is an undue burden to calculate individual charges for providing records, as the city does not have the resources to devote to conducting a study to determine actual copying costs for all its records and to conduct such a study would interfere with other essential agency functions and the city adopts Washington State statutory default fees for costs of copies of records under the Public Records Act, Chapter 42.56 RCW, as set forth in the table below:

2.20.010 Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “campaign disclosure ordinance.” (Ord. 387 § 1, 1975).

2.20.020 Definitions.
A. “Ballot proposition” means any “measure” as defined by RCW 29.01.110 submitted by the city to the voters of Mercer Island.
B. “Campaign depository” means a bank designated by a candidate or political committee pursuant to MICC 2.20.050.
C. “Campaign treasurer” and “deputy campaign treasurer” mean the individuals appointed by a candidate or political committee, pursuant to MICC 2.20.050.
D. “Candidate” means any individual who seeks election to the city council. An individual shall be deemed to seek election when he first:
    1. Receives contributions or makes expenditures or reserves space or facilities with intent to promote his candidacy for office; or
    2. Announces publicly or files for office.
E. “Contribution” includes a loan, gift, deposit, subscription, forgiveness of indebtedness, donation, advance, pledge, payment, transfer of anything of value, including personal and professional services for less than full consideration, but does not include interest on moneys deposited in a political committee’s account, ordinary home hospitality and the rendering of part-time personal services of the sort commonly performed by volunteer campaign workers or incidental expenses personally incurred by volunteer campaign workers not in excess of $25 personally paid for by such worker. “Part-time” services, for the purposes of this chapter, means services in addition to regular full-time employment, or, in the case of an unemployed person, services not in excess of 20 hours per week, excluding weekends. For the purposes of this chapter, contributions other than money or its equivalent shall be deemed to have a money value equivalent to the fair market value of the contribution. Sums paid for tickets to fundraising events such as dinners and parties are contributions; however, the amount of any such contribution may be reduced for the purpose of complying with the reporting requirements of this chapter, by the actual cost of consumables furnished in connection with the purchase of such tickets, and only the excess over the actual cost of such consumables shall be deemed a contribution.
F. “Election” includes any election for the city council and any election in which a ballot proposition is submitted to the voters of Mercer Island by the city.
G. “Election campaign” means any campaign in support of or in opposition to a candidate for election to the city council and any campaign in support of, or in opposition to a ballot proposition submitted to the voters of Mercer Island by the city.
H. “Expenditure” includes a payment, contribution, subscription, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or agreement, whether or not legally enforceable, to make an expenditure. The term “expenditure” also includes a promise to pay, a payment or a transfer of anything of value in exchange for goods, services, property, facilities, or anything of value for the purpose of assisting, benefiting, or honoring any public official or candidate, or assisting in furthering or opposing any election campaign. For the purposes of this chapter, agreements to make expenditures, contracts, and promises to pay may be reported as estimated obligations until actual payment is made. The term “expenditure” shall not include the partial or complete repayment by a candidate or political committee of the principal of a loan, the receipt of which loan has been properly reported, or payment of service charges against a political committee’s campaign account.
I. “Final report” means the report described as a final report in MICC 2.20.080B.
J. “Political committee” means any person (except a candidate or an individual dealing with his own funds or property) having the expectation of receiving contributions or making expenditures in support of, or opposition to, any candidate for election to city council or any ballot proposition submitted to the voters of Mercer Island by the city. (Ord. 387 § 2, 1975).

2.20.030 Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter relating to election campaigns shall apply to elections to membership to city council and all ballot propositions submitted by the city to the voters of the city. (Ord. 387 § 3, 1975).

B. The statement of organization shall include but not be limited to:
    1. The name and address of the committee;
    2. The names and addresses of all related or affiliated committees or other persons, and the nature of the relationship or affiliation;
    3. The names, addresses and titles of its officers, or, if it has no officers, the names, addresses and titles of its responsible leaders;

    8. What distribution of surplus funds will be made in the event of dissolution;
    9. The street address of the place and the hours during which the committee will make available for public inspection its books of account and all reports filed in accordance with MICC 2.20.080;
    10. Such other information as the city clerk may by regulation prescribe, in keeping with the policies and purposes of this chapter.
C. Any material change in information previously submitted in a statement of organization shall be reported to the city clerk within the 10 days following the change. (Ord. A-50 § 1, 1986; amended during 1980 codification; Ord. 387 § 4, 1975).

2.20.050 Campaign treasurer and depositories.
A. Each candidate, within two weeks after becoming a candidate, and each political committee at the time it is required to file a statement of organization, shall designate and file with the city clerk the names and addresses of:

B. A candidate, a political committee or a campaign treasurer may appoint as many deputy campaign treasurers as is considered necessary and may designate not more than one additional campaign depository. The candidate or political committee shall file the names and addresses of the deputy campaign treasurers and additional campaign depositories with the city clerk.
C. A candidate may not knowingly establish use, direct or control more than one political committee for the purpose of supporting that candidate during a particular election campaign. This does not prohibit (a) in addition to a candidate’s participation in a political committee established to support a slate of candidate’s which includes the candidate; or (b) joint fundraising efforts by candidates when a separate political committee is established for that purpose and all contributions are disbursed to and accounted for on a pro rata basis by the benefiting candidates.
D. 1. A candidate or political committee may at any time remove a campaign treasurer or deputy campaign treasurer or change a designated campaign depository.
    2. In the event of the death, resignation, removal or change of a campaign treasurer or depository, the candidate or political committee shall designate and file with the city clerk the name and address of any successor.
E. No campaign treasurer, deputy campaign treasurer, or campaign depository shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter until his name and address is filed with the city clerk. (Ord. A-50 § 2, 1986; amended during 1980 codification; Ord. 387 § 5, 1975).

2.20.060 Deposit of contributions – Investment of campaign funds – Unidentified contributions – Cash contributions.
A. All monetary contributions received by a candidate or political committee shall be deposited by the campaign treasurer or deputy treasurer in a campaign depository in an account established and designated for that purpose. Such deposits shall be made within five business days of receipt of the contribution.
B. Political committees which support or oppose more than one candidate or ballot proposition or exist for more than one purpose may maintain multiple separate bank accounts within the same designated depository for such purpose; provided, that each such account shall bear the same name followed by an appropriate designation which accurately identifies its separate purpose; and, provided further, that transfers of funds which must be reported under MICC 2.20.090A.4, as now or hereafter amended, may not be made from more than one such account.
C. Nothing in this section prohibits a candidate or political committee from investing funds on hand in a campaign depository in bonds, certificates or savings accounts or other similar savings instruments in financial institutions other than the campaign depository; provided, that the commission and the appropriate county elections officer is notified in writing of the initiation and the termination of the investment; provided further, that the principal of such investment when terminated together with all interest, dividends and income derived from the investment are deposited in the campaign depository in the account from which the investment was made and properly reported to the commission and the appropriate county elections officer prior to any further disposition or expenditures thereof.
D. Accumulated unidentified contributions, other than those made by persons whose names must be maintained on a separate and private list by a political committee’s campaign treasurer pursuant to MICC 2.20.090, which total in excess of one percent of the total accumulated contributions received in the current calendar year or $300 whichever is more, shall not be deposited, used or expended, but shall be returned to the donor if his identity can be ascertained. If the donor can not be ascertained, the contribution shall escheat to the state, and shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the estate general fund.
E. A contribution of more than $50 in currency may not be accepted unless a receipt, signed by the contributor and by the candidate, campaign treasurer, or deputy campaign treasurer, is prepared and made a part of the campaign or political committee’s financial records. (Ord. A-50 § 3, 1986; Ord. 485 § 1, 1979; Ord. 387 § 6, 1975).

2.20.070 Authorization and restriction of expenditures.
No expenditures shall be made or incurred by any candidate or political committee except on the authority of the campaign treasurer or the candidate, and a record of all such expenditures shall be maintained by the campaign treasurer. (Ord. 387 § 7, 1975).

2.20.080 Candidates’ and treasurers’ duty to report.
A. On the day the campaign treasurer is designated, each candidate or political committee shall file with the city clerk, in addition to any statement of organization required under MICC 2.20.040, a report of all contributions received and expenditures made in the election campaign prior to that date.
B. At the intervals set forth in RCW 42.17.060 currently or as hereafter amended each campaign treasurer shall file with the city clerk a further report of the contributions received and expenditures made since the date of the last report. (Ord. A-50 § 4, 1986; Ord. 387 § 8, 1975).

2.20.090 Contents of report.
Each report required under MICC 2.20.080 shall disclose for the period beginning at the end of the period for the last report or, in the case of an initial report, at the time of the first contribution or expenditure, and ending not more than five days prior to the date the report is due such information as is required by RCW 42.17.090 currently or as hereafter amended. (Ord. A-50 § 5, 1986; Ord. 387 § 9, 1975).

2.20.100 Identification of contributions and communications.
No contribution shall be made and no expenditure shall be incurred, directly or indirectly, in a fictitious name, anonymously, or by one person through an agent, relative, or other person in such a manner as to conceal the identity of the source of the contribution or in any other manner so as to effect concealment. (Ord. 387 § 10, 1975).

2.20.110 Name and address of printer, etc., and distributor of handbills.

A. The person or legal entity who printed, wrote, compiled or manufactured the same; and
B. The person or legal entity who caused the same to be distributed; provided, however, that in the case of a fictitious person or legal entity in addition to such fictitious name, the true names and addresses of the owners, managers, or agents of the person or legal entity sponsoring said handbill shall also appear thereon. (Ord. 387 § 11, 1975).

2.20.120 Use of public office facilities in campaign prohibited.
No elective official, nor any employee of his office nor any person appointed to or employed by any public office or agency may use or authorize the use of any of the facilities of his public office or agency, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of assisting a campaign for election of any person to any office or for the promotion or opposition to any ballot proposition. Facilities of public office or agency include but are not limited to use of stationery, postage, machines and equipment, use of employees of the office or agency during working hours, vehicles, office space, publications of the office or agency and clientele lists of persons served by the office or agency; provided, the foregoing provisions of this section shall not apply to the following activities:

(Ord. 452 § 5, 1978).

Upon filing of the proposed initiative measure, the city clerk shall assign a number to each such initiative petition and forthwith transmit one copy of the measure proposed, bearing such number, to the city council, the city manager and to the city attorney.

(Ord. 452 § 6, 1978).

2.24.070 Initiative – Statement.
An initiative statement shall be phrased in language so that a “yes” vote will clearly be a vote in favor of the action or condition that would result from the approval of the measure, and a “no” vote will clearly be a vote in opposition to such action or condition. The statement may be distinct from the petitioner’s title of the measure, and shall express and give a true and impartial statement of the purpose of the measure. It shall not intentionally be an argument or create prejudice, either for or against the measure. (Ord. 452 § 7, 1978).

2.24.080 Initiative petition – Time for filing.
Initiative petitions containing the required signatures of registered voters of the city as provided in RCW 35A.11.100 must be filed with the city clerk within 90 days from the date of issuance of the initiative statement by the city attorney. If petitioner fails to file such petition within the prescribed time limit, it shall have no validity and the petition will not be considered by the council as an initiative petition. (Ord. 452 § 8, 1978).

2.24.090 Initiative petition – Requirements.
Every signer to a petition submitting a proposed ordinance to the city council shall add to his/her signature, the signer’s printed name and his/her place of residence giving street and number. The signatures need not all be appended to one paper, but one of the signers on each paper must attach thereto an affidavit stating the number of signatures thereon, that each signature thereon is a genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be and that the statements therein made are true as he believes. (Ord. 452 § 9, 1978).

2.24.100 Initiative petition – Form and sufficiency.
The form and sufficiency of the petition shall be as follows:
A. A petition may include any page or group of pages containing the statement prepared by the city attorney along with the initiative number and shall contain the following essential elements when applicable:
    1. The text or prayer of the petition shall be a concise statement of the action or relief sought by petitioners and shall include a reference to the applicable state statute or city ordinance, if any;
    2. If the petition initiates or refers to an ordinance, a true copy of the ordinance;
    3. Numbered lines for signatures with space provided beside each signature for the printed name of the signer, the address of the signer and the date of signing;
    4. The warning statement prescribed in subsection B of this section.
B. Petitions shall be printed or typed on single sheets of white paper of good quality and each sheet of petition paper having a space thereon for signatures shall contain the text or prayer of the petition and the following warning:WARNING:
Any person who signs this petition with any other than their true name, or who knowingly signs more than one of these petitions, or signs a petition seeking an election when he/she is not a legal voter, or signs a petition when he/she is otherwise not qualified to sign, or who makes herein any false statement, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Each signature shall be executed in ink or indelible pencil and shall be followed by the printed name of the signer, the date of the signing and the address of the signer as follows:
Petitioner’s Signature
Printed Name – Residence Address – Date
1. _______________________________
2. _______________________________
3. _______________________________
4. _______________________________
C. The term “signer” means any person who signs his own name to the petition.
D. To be sufficient a petition must contain valid signatures of qualified registered voters in number equal to not less than 15 percent of the names of persons listed as registered voters within the city on the day of the last preceding city general election. Within three working days after the filing of a petition, the city clerk shall transmit the petition to the county auditor for a determination of sufficiency. The county auditor whose duty it is to determine the sufficiency of the petition shall proceed to make such determination with reasonable promptness and shall file a certificate stating the date upon which such determination was begun, which date shall be referred to as the terminal date. Additional pages of one or more signatures may be added to the petition by filing the same with the county auditor prior to such terminal date. No signatures shall be accepted or withdrawn after such terminal date. Any signer of a filed petition may withdraw his or her signature by a written request for withdrawal filed with the county auditor prior to such terminal date. Such written request shall so sufficiently describe the petition as to make identification of the person and the petition certain. The name of any person seeking to withdraw shall be signed exactly the same as contained on the petition and filing of such request for withdrawal, prior to the terminal date, the signature of any person seeking such withdrawal shall be deemed withdrawn.
E. Petitions containing the required number of signatures shall be accepted as prima facie valid until their invalidity has been proved.
F. A variation on petitions between the signatures on the petition and that on the voter’s permanent registration caused by the substitution of initials instead of the first or middle names, or both, shall not invalidate the signatures on the petition if the surname and handwriting are the same.
G. Signatures, including the original, of any person who has signed a petition two or more times shall be stricken.
H. Signatures following a date of signing which is more than 90 days prior to the date of filing of the petition shall be stricken.
I. The county auditor who is responsible for determining the sufficiency of the petition shall do so in writing and transmit the written certificate to the city clerk with whom the petition was originally filed. (Ord. 03C-19 § 2; Ord. 452 § 10, 1978).

2.24.110 Initiative petition – Receipt by city clerk.
Within three working days from the filing of a petition submitting a proposed ordinance, the city clerk shall stamp the petition on the date received and forward the petition to the county auditor for a determination of sufficiency or insufficiency pursuant to MICC 2.24.100. (Ord. 03C-19 § 3; Ord. 452 § 11, 1978).

2.24.120 Initiative petition – City council action.
A. If the petition is certified by the county auditor as sufficient pursuant to MICC 2.24.100, and if it contains a request that, unless passed by the city council, the ordinance be submitted to a vote of the people, the city council shall either:
    1. Pass the proposed ordinance without alteration within a reasonable time period after the county auditor’s certificate of sufficiency; or
    2. Reject the proposed ordinance; the city council may after rejection of any initiative measure propose and pass a different ordinance dealing with the same subject.
B. If the city council rejects any initiative measure, or fails to pass an initiative measure without alteration within a reasonable time period after the county auditor’s certificate of sufficiency is attached, or passes a different measure dealing with the same subject, the initiative measure without alteration and the different measure dealing with the same subject, if any, shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the city for approval or rejection at a special election to be held on the next available date specified for special elections pursuant to RCW 29.13.020. (Ord. 03C-19 § 4; Ord. 452 § 12, 1978).

2.24.130 Initiative petition – Appeal to court.
If the county auditor finds the petition insufficient, or if the city council refuses either to pass an initiative ordinance or order an election thereon, any taxpayer within the city may commence an action in the superior court against the county or city for the purpose of requiring an election to be held in the city for the purpose of voting upon the proposed ordinance if the court finds the petition to be sufficient. (Ord. 03C-19 § 5; Ord. 452 § 13, 1978).

2.24.140 Initiative – Conduct of election.
Publication of notice, the election, the canvass of the returns and declaration of the results shall be conducted in all respects as are other city elections. Any number of proposed ordinances may be voted on at the same election, but there shall not be more than one special election for that purpose during any one six-month period. (Ord. 452 § 14, 1978).

2.24.150 Initiative – Notice of election.

4.10.020 Definitions.
In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular.
Agricultural Product, Farmer. 
    1. “Agricultural product” means any product of plant cultivation or animal husbandry including, but not limited to: a product of horticulture, grain cultivation, vermiculture, viticulture, or aquaculture as defined in RCW 15.85.020; plantation Christmas trees; turf; or any animal including but not limited to an animal that is a private sector cultured aquatic product as defined in RCW 15.85.020, or a bird, or insect, or the substances obtained from such an animal. “Agricultural product” does not include animals intended to be pets.
    2. “Farmer” means any person engaged in the business of growing or producing, upon the person’s own lands or upon the lands in which the person has a present right of possession, any agricultural product whatsoever for sale. “Farmer” does not include a person using such products as ingredients in a manufacturing process, or a person growing or producing such products for the person’s own consumption. “Farmer” does not include a person selling any animal or substance obtained therefrom in connection with the person’s business of operating a stockyard or a slaughter or packing house. “Farmer” does not include any person in respect to the business of taking, cultivating, or raising timber.

“Business and occupation tax” or “gross receipts tax” means a tax imposed on or measured by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the business.
Chapter 82.32 RCW. Where provisions of Chapter 82.32 RCW are incorporated in MICC 4.10.160, “department” as used in the RCW shall refer to the “director” as defined in this section and “warrant” as used in the RCW shall mean “citation or criminal complaint.”
“City” means the city of Mercer Island.
“Commercial or industrial use” means the following uses of products, including by-products, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:
    1. Any use as a consumer; and
    2. The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.
“Competitive telephone service” means the providing by any person of telecommunications equipment or apparatus, or service related to that equipment or apparatus such as repair or maintenance service, if the equipment or apparatus is of a type which can be provided by persons that are not subject to regulation as telephone companies under RCW Title 80 and for which a separate charge is made.
“Consumer” means the following:
    1. Any person who purchases, acquires, owns, holds, or uses any tangible or intangible personal property irrespective of the nature of the person’s business and including, among others, without limiting the scope hereof, persons who install, repair, clean, alter, improve, construct, or decorate real or personal property of or for a consumer other than for the purpose of:
        a. Resale as tangible or intangible personal property in the regular course of business;
        b. Incorporating such property as an ingredient or component of real or personal property when installing, repairing, cleaning, altering, imprinting, improving, constructing, or decorating such real or personal property of or for consumers;
        c. Incorporating such property as an ingredient or component of a new product or as a chemical used in processing a new product when the primary purpose of such chemical is to create a chemical reaction directly through contact with an ingredient of a new product; or
        d. Consuming the property in producing ferrosilicon which is subsequently used in producing magnesium for sale, if the primary purpose of such property is to create a chemical reaction directly through contact with an ingredient of ferrosilicon;
    2. Any person engaged in any business activity taxable under MICC 4.10.030(A)(7);
    3. Any person who purchases, acquires, or uses any competitive telephone service as herein defined, other than for resale in the regular course of business;

Nothing contained in this or any other subsection of this section shall be construed to modify any other definition of “consumer.”
“Delivery” means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer’s representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer’s representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. “Dominion and control” means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer’s own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer’s representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property, and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer’s representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer’s representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (RCW Title 62A) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.
“Digital automated service,” “digital code,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as RCW 82.04.192.
“Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(b).
“Director” means the finance director of the city or any officer, agent or employee of the city designated to act on the director’s behalf.
“Eligible gross receipts tax” means a tax which:
    1. Is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within MICC 4.10.030; and
    2. Is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts, and is not an income tax or value added tax; and
    3. Is not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales price; and
    4. Is not a sales or use tax, business license fee, franchise fee, royalty or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege; and
    5. Is a tax imposed by a local jurisdiction, whether within or without the state of Washington, and not by a country, state, province, or any other non-local jurisdiction above the county level.
Engaging in Business. 
    1. The term “engaging in business” means commencing, conducting, or continuing in business, and also the exercise of corporate or franchise powers, as well as liquidating a business when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting such business.
    2. This section sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the city, and establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimus business activities in the city without having to register and obtain a business license or pay city business and occupation taxes. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection 1 of this definition. If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the city shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and applicable law.
    3. Without being all inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf, constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:
        a. Owning, renting, leasing, maintaining, or having the right to use, or using, tangible personal property, intangible personal property, or real property permanently or temporarily located in the city.
        b. Owning, renting, leasing, using, or maintaining an office, place of business, or other establishment in the city.
        c. Soliciting sales.
        d. Making repairs or providing maintenance or service to real or tangible personal property, including warranty work and property maintenance.
        e. Providing technical assistance or service, including quality control, product inspections, warranty work, or similar services on or in connection with tangible personal property sold by the person or on its behalf.
        f. Installing, constructing, or supervising installation or construction of real or tangible personal property.
        g. Soliciting, negotiating, or approving franchise, license, or other similar agreements.
        h. Collecting current or delinquent accounts.
        i. Picking up and transporting tangible personal property, solid waste, construction debris, or excavated materials.

4.10.040 Agency – Sales and services by agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.
A. Sales in Own Name – Sales or Purchases As Agent. Every person, including agents, consignees, bailees, factors or auctioneers having either actual or constructive possession of tangible personal property or having possession of the documents of title thereto, with power to sell such tangible personal property in the person’s own name and actually so selling shall be deemed the seller of such tangible personal property within the meaning of this chapter. The burden shall be upon the taxpayer in every case to establish the fact that such taxpayer is not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property but is acting merely as broker or agent in promoting sales or making purchases for a principal. Such claim will be recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:
    1. The books and records of the broker or agent show the transactions were made in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the name of the actual owner of the property for whom the sale was made, or the actual buyer for whom the purchase was made.
    2. The books and records show the amount of the principal’s gross sales, the amount of commissions and any other incidental income derived by the broker or agent from such sales.

Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement.
    3. No ownership rights may be conferred to the agent unless the principal refuses to pay, or refuses to abide by the agency agreement. Sales or purchases of any goods by a person who has any ownership rights in such goods shall be taxed as retail or wholesale sales.

B. If the above requirements are not met the consignor, bailor, principal or other shall be deemed a seller of such property to the agent, consignee, bailee, factor or auctioneer.
C. Services in Own Name – Procuring Services As Agent. For purposes of this subsection, an agent is a person who acts under the direction and control of the principal in procuring services on behalf of the principal that the person could not itself render or supply.

Any person who claims to be acting merely as agent in obtaining services for a principal will have such claim recognized only when the contract or agreement between such persons clearly establishes the relationship of principal and agent and when the following conditions are complied with:
    1. The books and records of the agent show that the services were obtained in the name and for the account of the principal, and show the actual principal for whom the purchase was made.
    2. The books and records show the amount of the service that was obtained for the principal, the amount of commissions and any other income derived by the agent for acting as such. Amounts received from the principal as advances and reimbursements must not be reflected as the agent’s income on any of the agent’s books and records. Commissions must be computed according to a set percentage or amount, which is agreed upon in the agency agreement. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1).

C. To take the credit authorized by this section, a taxpayer must be able to document that the amount of tax sought to be credited was paid upon the same gross receipts used in computing the tax against which the credit is applied and that the taxpayer paid the amount of tax sought to be credited.

Persons taxable under the retailing or wholesaling classification with respect to selling products in this city shall be allowed a credit against those taxes for any eligible gross receipts taxes paid (1) with respect to the manufacturing of the products sold in the city, and (2) with respect to the extracting of the products, or the ingredients used in the products, sold in the city. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the tax liability arising under this chapter with respect to the sale of those products.

For taxes due prior to January 1, 2008, a taxpayer that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax on the same activity in more than one jurisdiction may be entitled to a deduction as follows:
    1. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax, with respect to a sale of goods or services, to a jurisdiction in which the goods are delivered or the services are provided may deduct an amount equal to the gross receipts used to measure that tax from the measure of the tax owed to the city.
    2. Notwithstanding the above, a person that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax in more than one jurisdiction on the gross income derived from intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall assign those gross receipts to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located).
    3. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with another city may deduct an amount equal to the contract price used to measure the tax due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the city.
B. Person Manufacturing Products Within and Without. A person manufacturing products within the city using products manufactured by the same person outside the city may deduct from the measure of the manufacturing tax the value of products manufactured outside the city and included in the measure of an eligible gross receipts tax paid to the other jurisdiction with respect to manufacturing such products. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 07C-14 § 2; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

A. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under MICC 4.10.030(A)(7) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.
B. In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.
C. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:
    1. The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;
    2. If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;
    3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;
    4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and
    5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.
D. If none of the methods in subsection C of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, then the city and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative method under this subsection. The city may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the city are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.
E. For purposes of subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, “receive” has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.
F. Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other activities taxed under MICC 4.10.030(A)(7) shall be apportioned to the city by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service-income factor and the denominator of which is two.
    1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:
        a. The individual is primarily assigned within the city;
        b. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs 50 percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the city; or
        c. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of his or her service in any city and the employee resides in the city.
    2. The service-income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the city if:
        a. The customer location is in the city; or
        b. The income-producing activity is performed in more than one location and a greater proportion of the service-income-producing activity is performed in the city than in any other location, based on costs of performance, and the taxpayer is not taxable at the customer location; or
        c. The service-income-producing activity is performed within the city, and the taxpayer is not taxable in the customer location.
    3. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city or cities in which the taxpayer does business, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrators may jointly require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, that one of the following methods be used jointly by the cities to allocate or apportion gross income, if reasonable:
        a. Separate accounting;
        b. The use of a single factor;
        c. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; or
        d. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.
G. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.
    1. “Apportionable income” means the gross income of the business taxable under the service classifications of a city’s gross receipts tax, including income received from activities outside the city if the income would be taxable under the service classification if received from activities within the city, less any exemptions or deductions available.

If taxes are reported by a taxpayer on a basis more frequent than once per year, taxpayers shall calculate the factors for the previous calendar year for reporting in the current calendar year and correct the reporting for the previous year when the factors are calculated for that year, but not later than the end of the first quarter of the following year.
    8. “Taxable in the customer location” means either that a taxpayer is subject to a gross receipts tax in the customer location for the privilege of doing business, or that the government where the customer is located has the authority to subject the taxpayer to gross receipts tax regardless of whether, in fact, the government does so.
H. Assignment or apportionment of revenue under this section shall be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution where applicable. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 07C-14 § 3).

The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 05C-15 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.120 Payment methods – Mailing returns or remittances – Time extension – Deposits – Recording payments – Payment must accompany return – NSF checks.
A. Taxes shall be paid to the director in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the director. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.
B. A return or remittance that is transmitted to the city by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the post office upon the envelope containing it. The director may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the city electronically shall be deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the director.
C. If a written request is received prior to the due date, the director, for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and file returns.
D. The director shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received or refunded. The director shall apply payments first against all penalties and interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer.
E. For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.
F. Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for any other reason will not be considered received until payment by certified check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a “non-sufficient funds (NSF)” charge of $20, is received by the director. Any license issued upon payment with a NSF check will be considered void, and shall be returned to the director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $20 NSF fee) is received.
G. The director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees, when and as due under this chapter. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.130 Records to be preserved – Examination – Estoppel to question assessment.
Every person liable for any fee or tax imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of five years after filing a tax return, such records as may be necessary to determine the amount of any fee or tax for which the person may be liable; which records shall include copies of all federal income tax and state tax returns and reports made by the person. All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the director or its duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the director or a duly authorized agent.
A. If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the city, it shall be sufficient if such person (1) produces within the city such books and records as may be required by the director, or (2) bears the cost of examination by the director’s agent at the place where such books and records are kept; provided, that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the director the estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.
B. Any person who fails, or refuses a department request, to provide or make available records, or to allow inspection or examination of the business premises, shall be forever barred from questioning in any court action the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the city for any period for which such records have not been provided, made available or kept and preserved, or in respect of which inspection or examination of the business premises has been denied. The director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.140 Accounting methods.
A. A taxpayer may file tax returns in each reporting period with amounts based upon cash receipts only if the taxpayer’s books of account are kept on a cash receipts basis.

B. The taxes imposed and the returns required, hereunder, shall be upon a calendar year basis. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.150 Public work contracts – Payment of fee and tax before final payment for work.
The director may, before issuing any final payment to any person performing any public work contract for the city, require such person to pay in full all license fees or taxes due under this title from such person on account of such contract or otherwise, and may require such taxpayer to file with the director a verified list of all subcontractors supplying labor and/or materials to the person in connection with said public work. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.160 Underpayment of tax, interest, or penalty – Interest – Limitations.
A. Underpayment. If, upon examination of any returns, or from other information obtained by the director, it appears that a tax or penalty less than that properly due has been paid, the director shall assess the additional amount found to be due and shall add thereto interest on the tax only. The director shall notify the person by mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice, or within such time as the director may provide in writing.
B. Interest. 
    1. For tax periods prior to December 31, 2004, the director shall compute interest in accordance with the then-applicable provisions of this chapter and Washington law.

4.10.165 Time in which assessment may be made.
The director shall not assess, or correct an assessment for, additional taxes, penalties, or interest due more than four years after the close of the calendar year in which they were due, except that the director may issue an assessment:

B. Against a person that has committed fraud or who misrepresented a material fact; or
C. Against a person that has executed a written waiver of such limitations. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 07C-14 § 5; Ord. 04-13 § 1. Formerly 4.10.160(C)).

4.10.170 Overpayment of tax, penalty, or interest – Credit or refund – Interest rate – Statute of limitations.
A. Overpayment. If, upon receipt of an application for a refund, or during an audit or examination of the taxpayer’s records and tax returns, the director determines that the amount of tax, penalty, or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.
B. Waiver. The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the director discovers that a refund or credit is due.
C. Refunds. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the director and by the issuance of a city check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.
D. Final Judgment. Any final judgment for which a recovery is granted by any court of competent jurisdiction for tax, penalties, interest, or costs paid by any person shall be paid in the same manner as provided in subsection C of this section, upon the filing with the director a certified copy of the order or judgment of the court.

4.10.180 Late payment – Disregard of written instructions – Evasion – Penalties.

D. If the director finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the director a license as required by Chapter 5.01 MICC, the director shall impose a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(4), as it now exists or as it may be amended. No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection D if the person who has engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the director of the need to be licensed.
E. If the director determines that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from the taxpayer’s failure to follow specific written tax reporting instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.
F. If the director finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable, the director shall assess a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(6), as it now exists or as it may be amended.
G. The penalties imposed under subsections (A) through (E) of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.
H. The director shall not impose both the evasion penalty and the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions on the same tax found to be due.
I. For the purposes of this section, “return” means any document a person is required by the city of Mercer Island to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a statutorily defined due date.
J. If incorporation into the city of Mercer Island code of future changes to RCW 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.090 existing at the time the ordinance codified in this section is effective shall apply. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 07C-14 § 5; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.190 Cancellation of penalties.
A. The director may cancel any penalties imposed under MICC 4.10.180(A) and (B) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date. The director has no authority to cancel any other penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in subsection C of this section.
B. A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the director within 30 days after the date the department mails the notice that the penalties are due. The request must be in writing and contain competent proof of all pertinent facts supporting a reasonable cause determination. In all cases the burden of proving the facts rest upon the taxpayer.
C. The director may cancel the penalties in MICC 4.10.180(A) and (B) one time if a person:

    3. Obtained business licenses and filed past due tax returns within 30 days after being notified by the department.

B. Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the city from the taxpayer until such time as: (1) the taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the city showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due, or (2) more than six months has passed since the successor notified the director of the acquisition and the director has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment.
C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer.
D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the director of the acquisition, and the department does not within six months of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

Any person, except one who has failed to comply with MICC 4.10.130, aggrieved by the amount of the fee or tax determined by the director to be required under the provisions of this chapter may pay the amount due and appeal from such determination by filing a written notice of appeal to the director with the filing fee set by city council resolution for administrative appeals, within 30 days from the date written notice of such amount was mailed to the taxpayer. The hearing examiner shall fix a time and place for the hearing of such appeal, and shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the parties. The hearing shall be conducted in accord with the provisions of MICC 19.15.130. The decision of the hearing examiner shall indicate the correct amount of the fee or tax owing. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.215 Judicial review of administrative appeal decision.
The taxpayer or the city may obtain judicial review of the hearing examiner’s administrative decision by applying for a writ of review in the King County superior court within 10 days from the date of the hearing examiner’s decision in accordance with the procedure set forth in Chapter 7.16 RCW, other applicable law, and court rules. The city shall have the same right of review from the administrative decision as does a taxpayer. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1).

4.10.220 Director to make rules.
The director shall have the power, from time to time, to adopt, publish and enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with this chapter or with law for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter and it shall be unlawful to violate or fail to comply with any such rule or regulation.

C. To apply the city’s tax prospectively where a taxpayer has no office or place of business within the city and has paid tax on all gross income to another Washington city where the taxpayer is located; provided, that the other city maintains an eligible gross receipts tax, and the income was not derived from contracts with the city. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.240 Mailing of notices.
Any notice required by this chapter to be mailed to any taxpayer or licensee shall be sent by ordinary mail, addressed to the address of the taxpayer or licensee as shown by the records of the director. Failure of the taxpayer or licensee to receive any such mailed notice shall not release the taxpayer or licensee from any tax, fee, interest, or any penalties thereon, nor shall such failure operate to extend any time limit set by the provisions of this chapter. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to inform the director in writing about a change in the taxpayer’s address. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

4.10.250 Tax declared additional.
The license fee and tax herein levied shall be additional to any license fee or tax imposed or levied under any other law or any other ordinance of the city except as herein otherwise expressly provided. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

        a. A taxpayer’s identity;
        b. The nature, source, or amount of the taxpayer’s income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemption, credits, assets, liability, net worth, tax liability deficiencies, over assessments, or tax payments, whether taken from the taxpayer’s books and records or any other source;

    However, data, material, or documents that do not disclose information related to a specific or identifiable taxpayer do not constitute tax information under this section. Nothing in this chapter requires any person possessing data, material, or documents made confidential and privileged by this section to delete information from such data, material or documents so as to permit its disclosure.
    3. “City agency” means every city office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other city agency.
    4. “Taxpayer identity” means the taxpayer’s name, address, telephone number, registration number, or any combination thereof, or any other information disclosing the identity of the taxpayer.

C. This section does not prohibit the director from:
    1. Disclosing such return or tax information in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or an administrative proceeding:
        a. In respect of any tax imposed under this chapter if the taxpayer or its officer or other person liable under this title is a party in the proceeding; or

However, tax information not received from the taxpayer must not be so disclosed if the director determines that such disclosure would compromise any investigation or litigation by any federal, state, or local government agency in connection with the civil or criminal liability of the taxpayer or another person, or that such disclosure would identify a confidential informant, or that such disclosure is contrary to any agreement entered into by the department that provides for the reciprocal exchange of information with other government agencies which agreement requires confidentiality with respect to such information unless such information is required to be disclosed to the taxpayer by the order of any court;
    3. Publishing statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or reports or items thereof;
    4. Disclosing such return or tax information, for official purposes only, to the mayor or city attorney, or to any city agency, or to any member of the city council or their authorized designees dealing with matters of taxation, revenue, trade, commerce, the control of industry or the professions;

    7. Disclosing any such return or tax information to the proper officer of the Internal Revenue Service of the United States, the Canadian government or provincial governments of Canada, or to the proper officer of the tax department of any state or city or town or county, for official purposes, but only if the statutes of the United States, Canada or its provincial governments, or of such other state or city or town or county, as the case may be, grants substantially similar privileges to the proper officers of the city;
    8. Disclosing any such return or tax information to the United States Department of Justice, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Defense, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection agencies of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States Coast Guard, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Department of Treasury, and the United States Department of Transportation, or any authorized representative of these federal agencies or their successors, for official purposes;

The disclosure must be in connection with the department’s official duties under this title, or a civil or criminal investigation. The disclosure may occur only when the person under investigation and the person in possession of data, materials, or documents are parties to the return or tax information to be disclosed. The department may disclose return or tax information such as invoices, contracts, bills, statements, resale or exemption certificates, or checks. However, the department may not disclose general ledgers, sales or cash receipt journals, check registers, accounts receivable/payable ledgers, general journals, financial statements, expert’s workpapers, income tax returns, state tax returns, tax return workpapers, or other similar data, materials, or documents.

        b. The production of the data, materials, or documents sought would be unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the department, the amount in controversy, limitations on the petitioner’s resources, and the importance of the issues at stake; or
        c. The data, materials, or documents sought for disclosure contain trade secret information that, if disclosed, could harm the petitioner.

E. Service of a subpoena issued by the court or hearing examiner does not constitute a disclosure of return or tax information under this section. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this section, a person served with a subpoena issued by the court or hearing examiner may disclose the existence or content of the subpoena to that person’s legal counsel.
F. Any person acquiring knowledge of any return or tax information in the course of his or her employment with the city and any person acquiring knowledge of any return or tax information as provided under subsection (C)(4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), or (10) of this section, who discloses any such return or tax information to another person not entitled to knowledge of such return or tax information under the provisions of this section, is guilty of a misdemeanor. If the person guilty of such violation is an officer or employee of the city, such person must forfeit such office or employment and is incapable of holding any public office or employment in this city for a period of two years thereafter. (Ord. 12C-13 § 1; Ord. 04-13 § 1).

(Ord. 09C-13 § 1; Ord. 95C-002 § 1).

4.12.030 Tax levied.
A tax is levied, in such amount as shall be determined by the city council from time to time by ordinance, said tax to be imposed upon and collected from every person, firm, corporation or other entity engaged in or carrying on the following types of businesses within or partly within the corporate limits of the city, said tax being for the privilege of being allowed to do business as defined in this section:
A. Upon everyone engaged in or carrying on a telephone business, a tax based on the total gross income from such business in the city. Gross income for this purpose shall not include charges which are passed on to the subscribers by a telephone company pursuant to tariffs required by regulatory order to compensate for the cost to the company of tax imposed by this chapter.
The term “telephone business” means the business of providing access to a local telephone network, local telephone network switching service, toll service, or coin telephone service, communication or transmission for hire via a local telephone network, toll line or channel, or similar communication or transmission system. It includes cooperative or farmer line telephone companies or associations operating an exchange. “Telephone business” does not include the providing of competitive telephone service, nor the providing of cable television service. In determining gross income from such telephone business, including intrastate toll telephone service, the taxpayer shall include 100 percent of the gross income derived from such business in the city. The term “competitive telephone service” means the providing by any person of telecommunications equipment or apparatus, or service related to that equipment or apparatus such as repair or maintenance service, if the equipment or apparatus is of a type which can be provided by persons that are not subject to regulation as telephone companies under RCW Title 80 and for which a separate charge is made;
B. A tax on the sale, delivery or distribution of electricity and electrical energy and for the privilege of carrying on said business, said tax to be based on the total gross income from such business in the city; provided, however, that there shall not be any tax levied for installation charges of electrical units;
C. A tax on the sale, delivery, distribution or furnishing of natural gas for domestic, business or industrial consumption and for the privilege of carrying on said business, such tax to be based on the total gross income from such business in the city; provided, however, that there shall not be any tax levied for installation charges of gas energy units;
D. A tax based on the total gross income derived from the business of furnishing community antenna television (cable television) services in the city;
E. A tax based on the total gross income derived from the business of collecting, handling or transporting garbage and refuse within the city;
F. Upon everyone engaged in or carrying on a cellular telephone business or service, a tax based on the total gross income from such business. “Cellular telephone business or service” means a two-way voice and data telephone/telecommunications system based in whole or substantially in part on wireless radio communications and which is not subject to regulation by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC). This includes cellular mobile service. The definition of “cellular mobile service” includes other wireless radio communications services such as specialized mobile radio (SMR), personal communications services (PCS), and any other evolving wireless radio communications technology which accomplishes a purpose similar to cellular mobile service. “Cellular telephone business or service” does not mean telephone business or competitive telephone service as previously defined.
    1. There shall be excluded from the total gross income upon which the tax is computed the following:
        a. That portion of the gross income derived from charges to another telecommunications company, as defined in RCW 80.04.010, for connecting fees, switching charges, or carrier access charges relating to intrastate toll telephone services, or for access to, or charges for, interstate services;
        b. Charges by a taxpayer engaging in a telephone business to a telecommunications company, as defined in RCW 80.04.100, for telephone service that the purchaser buys for the purpose of resale;
        c. Adjustments made to a billing or to a customer account or to a telecommunications company accrual account in order to reverse a billing or charge that had been made as a result of third-party fraud or other crime and was not properly a debt of a customer;
        d. Charges to cellular telephone service subscribers passed on to compensate for the cost to the company of the tax imposed by this chapter;
    2. Service Address. Payments by a customer for the telephone service from telephones without a fixed location shall be allocated among taxing jurisdictions to the location of the customer’s principal service address during the period for which the tax applies. There is a presumption that the service address a customer supplies to the taxpayer is current and accurate, unless the taxpayer has actual knowledge to the contrary;
    3. Roaming Phones. When the service is provided while a subscriber is roaming outside the subscriber’s normal cellular network area, the gross income shall be assigned consistent with the taxpayer’s accounting system to the location of the originating cell site of the call, or to the location of the main cellular switching office that switched the call;
    4. Dispute Resolution. If there is a dispute between or among the city and another city or cities as to the service address of a customer who is receiving cellular telephone services and the dispute is not resolved by negotiation among the parties, then the dispute shall be resolved by the city and the other city or cities by submitting the issue for settlement to the Association of Washington Cities (AWC). Once taxes on the disputed revenues have been paid to one of the contesting cities, the cellular telephone service company shall have no further liability with respect to additional taxes, penalties, or interest on the disputed revenues so long as it promptly changes its billing records for future revenues to comport with the settlement facilitated by AWC;
    5. The city manager or his/her appointed designee is authorized to represent the city in negotiations with other cities for the proper allocation of taxes due under this subsection F;
    6. No change in the rate of tax upon persons engaging in providing cellular telephone service shall apply to business activities occurring before the effective date of the change and, except for a change in the tax rate authorized by RCW 35.21.870, no change in the rate of the tax may take effect sooner than 60 days following the enactment of the ordinance establishing the change. The city manager or his/her designee shall send to each cellular telephone service company, at the address on its license, a copy of any ordinance changing the rate of tax upon cellular telephone service promptly upon its enactment;
G. A tax equal to eight percent effective July 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018, and a tax equal to 5.3 percent effective on and after January 1, 2019, of the total gross income derived from the sale, delivery, distribution, furnishing or maintenance of water services for residential, commercial, or public consumption and for the privilege of carrying on said business, such tax to be based on the total gross income from such business in the city; provided, however, that there shall not be any tax levied for water service connection or installation charge;
H. A tax equal to eight percent effective July 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018, and a tax equal to 5.3 percent effective on and after January 1, 2019, of the total gross income derived from the furnishing, operation, or maintenance of sewer services for residential, commercial, or public consumption and for the privilege of carrying on said business, such tax to be based on the total gross income from such business in the city; provided, however, that there shall not be any tax levied for sewer service connection or installation charges;
I. A tax equal to eight percent effective July 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018, and a tax equal to 5.3 percent effective on and after January 1, 2019, of the total gross income derived from the furnishing, operation, or maintenance of storm water services for residential, commercial, or public use and for the privilege of carrying on said business, such tax to be based on the total gross income from such business in the city; provided, however, that there shall not be any tax levied for storm water service fee-in-lieu or installation charges.

        a. Encourage increased residential opportunities within the city; or
        b. Stimulate the construction of new affordable multifamily housing; or

D. The following areas, as shown in Map 1 in subsection (D)(1) of this section, meet the criteria of this chapter for residential targeted areas and are designated as such:

6.10.010 Purpose and scope.
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure compliance with the city’s adopted building, land development, land use, nuisance and related codes as specified in subsection B of this section, enabling the city to fulfill its duty to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public. These regulations establish procedures and mechanisms to resolve violations of the city’s adopted building, land development, land use, nuisance, and related codes. This chapter establishes penalties for violations, provides an opportunity for a prompt hearing, decision, and appeal as to alleged code violations, provides for abatement when necessary, and provides a mechanism to recover the city’s costs. This chapter shall be enforced for the benefit of the general public, not for the benefit of any particular person or class of persons.
It is the intent of this chapter to place the obligation for code compliance on the person responsible for a violation, within the scope of this chapter, and not to impose any duty upon the city or any of its officers, officials or employees, which would subject them to damages in a civil action.
B. Scope. This chapter may be applied for the purposes of enforcing Chapter 8.24 MICC, Nuisance Control Code, MICC Titles 15,Water, Sewers and Public Utilities, 17, Construction Codes, 19, Unified Land Development Code, and other codes, ordinances, resolutions, permit conditions, or public rules that promote or protect the public health, safety or welfare and the environment. The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and may be used, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in addition to other applicable provisions of the MICC or other applicable law or regulation. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.020 General provisions.
A. Declaration of Public Nuisance. All code violations are determined to be detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare and environment and are declared to be public nuisances. All conditions determined to be code violations may be subject to and enforced pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, except where specifically excluded by law or regulation.
B. Authority and Approach. The director (as that term is defined in MICC 6.10.110) is authorized to enforce the provisions of Chapter 8.24MICC, Nuisance Control Code, MICC Titles 15, Water, Sewers and Public Utilities, 17, Construction Codes, 19, Unified Land Development Code, and other codes, ordinances, resolutions, or public rules that promote or protect the public health, safety or welfare and the environment. The violation of any regulation is unlawful, and the director may take reasonable action to bring about compliance through the use of the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable provisions of the MICC, including but not limited to the revocation or modification of permits, and/or through the enforcement, penalty and abatement provisions described in this chapter.
Code compliance actions will be pursued at the discretion of the director primarily in a complaint driven manner. Responses to complaints or evidence of a civil violation shall be prioritized based on significance and severity, with potential violations concerning health, safety and welfare of the public or damage to the environment receiving highest priority.
After a complaint has been investigated, the director will determine the course of action. If a violation is present, the city may pursue compliance with city codes through the provisions of this chapter. The director shall have discretion to follow an incremental approach to securing compliance. This means starting by contacting the person responsible, explaining the violation and requesting voluntary correction. The director has the authority to reasonably determine the level of compliance, mitigation or remediation that is required as well as a reasonable timeline for completing the required actions. When appropriate, the director may secure compliance by proceeding incrementally to higher penalty levels by using the techniques and options in this chapter. Likewise, the director has the authority to offer reasonable extensions of timelines or other measures as appropriate when extenuating circumstances are present.
Alternatively, in the course of the investigation, the director may determine: (1) no violation exists; or (2) the basis of the issue is private in nature; or (3) the violation is de minimus, in which case, the director may decide to take no further action. Further, the director may find that a complaint or series of complaints between two or more individuals are frivolous, excessive and/or a form of harassment. In this case, the director may work with the complainant(s) to identify alternative means of dispute resolution (e.g., mediation), and may, under consultation with the city attorney, choose to limit communication with the complainants and responses to complaints that are frivolous or excessive. The city does not intend to ignore complaints and will continue to investigate subsequent, unrelated complaints from the complainant.
Nothing in this section shall preclude the director from taking other appropriate enforcement action to preclude harm to the health, safety or welfare of the public or the environment.
C. Duty to Comply. It shall be the responsibility of any person responsible for a violation to cure the violation and, if property is involved, to bring the property into compliance. Payment of fines, applications for permits, acknowledgment of stop work orders, and compliance with other remedies do not substitute for performing the corrective work required and having the property brought into compliance to the maximum extent reasonably possible under the circumstances. The date set for compliance in the notice of violation takes precedence over any date established for the expiration of any required permit(s) and will be subordinate only if modified by a supplemental notice of violation.
The person responsible has a duty to notify the director of any actions taken to achieve compliance. A violation shall be considered ongoing until the person responsible has come into compliance and has notified the director of this compliance, and an official inspection has verified compliance and all assessed penalties and costs have been paid to the city.
D. Additional Enforcement Provisions. The procedures set forth in this chapter are not exclusive. These procedures shall not in any manner limit or restrict the city from remedying or abating code violations in any other manner authorized by law. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.030 Right of entry.
The director is authorized to enter any property or premises at any reasonable time to determine whether a civil violation has occurred or is occurring, or to enforce any provision of the MICC or any city ordinance, violation of which is a civil violation under this chapter and could be a criminal violation under the MICC, or to perform follow-up inspections related to such a violation. The director may make examinations, surveys, and studies as may be necessary in the performance of his or her duties. These may include, but are not limited to, the taking of photographs, digital images, videotapes, video images, audio recordings, samples, or other physical evidence. If the property or premises is occupied, the director shall first present credentials and request entry. If an owner, occupant, or agent refuses entry, the city may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a search warrant authorizing access. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.040 Service of written notice.
Service of a notice of violation, stop work order, infraction or other official written notice of violation issued by the director shall be made by one of the following methods:
A. Personal Service. By personal service to the person responsible for the code violation, or by leaving a copy of the written notice at such person’s place of residence with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides therein.
B. Service by Posting. By posting the written notice in a conspicuous place on the property where the violation occurred and concurrently sending a notice either by electronic mail or by first-class mail.
C. Service by Mail. By mailing the written notice by regular first-class mail to the person responsible for the code violation at his, her or its last known address, at the address of the violation, or at the address of the place of business of the person responsible for the code violation. The taxpayer’s address as shown on the tax records of the county shall be deemed to be the proper address for the purpose of mailing such notice to the landowner of the property where the violation occurred. Service by mail shall be presumed effective upon the third business day following the day upon which the official written notice of violation was placed in the mail.
D. Service by Publication. For notice of violation only, when the address of the person responsible for the code violation cannot reasonably be determined, service may be made by publishing the abstract of the notice of violation substantially in the manner as set forth in RCW 4.28.110, as currently enacted or hereafter amended.
The failure of the director to make or attempt service of written notice shall not invalidate any proceedings as to any other person duly served. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.050 Enforcement provisions.
Violations may be enforced by issuing one or more civil infractions or one or more notices of violation or any combination thereof. The city shall have discretionary authority to enforce a violation by issuing a civil infraction or a notice of violation pursuant to this chapter or prosecuting it as a criminal matter.
Each day during which a code violation is committed, occurs or continues shall be considered a separate offense for purposes of civil infractions or notices of violation.
A. Misdemeanors. Any person who willfully or knowingly causes, aids or abets a code violation by any act of commission or omission is guilty of a misdemeanor, unless specifically designated as a gross misdemeanor, where such code violation results, or is likely to result, in a threat to public health, life, or safety or in significant harm to the environment. Upon conviction, the person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment in the county jail for a term not to exceed 90 days.
B. Code Violations. Whenever the director has reason to determine that a code violation occurred or is occurring, or that the code violations cited in an infraction have not been corrected, or that the terms of a voluntary correction agreement have not been met, the director is authorized to issue a notice of violation to any person responsible for the code violation.
Subsequent violations shall be treated as new violations for purposes of this section.
    1. Notice of Violation. A notice of violation shall be completed in a form approved by the director and the city attorney, and shall be served consistent with MICC 6.10.040 and shall, at minimum, include the following:
        a. The tax parcel number(s), address, when available, or description sufficient for identification of the building, structure, premises or land upon which or within which the violation has occurred or is occurring;
        b. A statement of each ordinance, regulation, code provision or permit requirement violated, and the facts to support that the violation(s) occurred or is occurring;
        c. The name of the city official issuing the notice and order and the name(s), if known, of the responsible party(ies) to whom the notice and order is being issued;
        d. An order requiring corrective action to be taken, description of corrective action that is necessary to achieve compliance, and a date by which the correction must be completed;
        e. A statement that if the violation is not corrected and the notice is not appealed, the determination is final and monetary penalties shall be due;
        f. The amount of penalty that will be assessed; and
        g. A statement advising of the right to appeal the notice of violation to the hearing examiner, instructions on how to file an appeal, and the date by which it must be filed.
    2. Supplementation, Revocation or Modification. Whenever there is new information or a change in circumstances, the director may add to, rescind in whole or in part or otherwise modify a notice of violation by issuing a supplemental notice of violation. The supplemental notice shall be governed by the same procedures applicable to all notices of violation contained in this chapter, including the right to appeal to the hearing examiner. In addition, the director is authorized to issue penalties accrued as a part of the supplemental notice of violation. If the deadline to appeal the notice of violation has expired, only portions from the notice of violation that are modified in the supplemental notice of violation are subject to appeal to the hearing examiner.
    3. Failure to Correct. Failure to correct the code violation in the manner prescribed in the notice of violation subjects the person responsible to any of the following compliance remedies:
        a. Civil penalties and costs;
        b. Continued responsibility for abatement, remediation and/or mitigation;
        c. Permit suspension, revocation, modification and/or denial;
        d. Costs of abatement incurred by the city; and/or
        e. Other remedies that may be available to the city.
    4. Time Limits. 
        a. Persons receiving a notice of violation shall rectify the code violations identified within the time period specified by the director in the notice of violation issued pursuant to this chapter.
        b. Unless an appeal is filed with the city for a hearing before the hearing examiner in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the notice of violation shall become the final administrative order of the director, and the civil penalties assessed and accrued shall be immediately due and subject to collection.
    5. Appeals. Any person identified in a notice of violation (or supplemental notice of violation) as a person responsible for a violation may appeal the same within 14 days of service, according to the procedures described in MICC 6.10.090. Failure to appeal the notice within 14 days shall render the notice a final determination that the conditions described therein existed and constitutes a code violation, that assessed and accrued civil penalties are due, and that the named party is liable as a person responsible.
C. Civil Infractions. Whenever the director has reason to determine that a civil code violation occurred or is occurring, the director is authorized to issue a civil infraction in accordance with Chapter 7.80 RCW, which is incorporated herein by this reference, upon the person responsible for the condition and/or who committed the civil code violation. First offenses shall be Class 2 civil infractions, for which the maximum penalty and the default amount shall be $125 for each infraction, and second or subsequent violations shall be Class 1 civil infractions, for which the maximum penalty and the default amount shall be $250 for each infraction, not including fees, costs, and assessments. The Mercer Island municipal court shall have jurisdiction over all infractions issued under this chapter.
D. Civil Penalties. 
    1. Civil Penalties. A civil penalty for violation of the terms and conditions of a notice of violation, stop work order or voluntary correction agreement shall be imposed at the rate of $100 per day for each violation, accruing for every day after the compliance date listed in the notice of violation. Thirty days after the compliance date, the penalty will increase to a rate of $250 per day for each violation. Sixty days after the compliance date, the penalty will increase to a rate of $500 per day for each violation, up to a maximum total penalty of $50,000 for each violation.
    2. Priority Violations. In addition to the penalties described in subsection (D)(1) of this section, any person that is responsible for a violation of the provisions of the following regulations will be subject to additional penalties. These penalties for priority violations, as described below, will be assessed one time and will not accrue daily.

    +-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
    When the potential penalty amount is listed as a range, the director will set the penalty based on the following criteria:
        a. The significance and severity of the violation and its impact on the public and the environment.
        b. The difficulty and time involved in resolving the violation and mitigating or remediating the area impacted by the violation.
        c. The resulting ill-gotten economic benefit and savings of construction costs realized by the person responsible for the violation.
    3. Repeat Violations. A repeat violation is a violation that has occurred on the same property, or that has been committed by the same person responsible elsewhere within the city, for which voluntary compliance previously has been agreed to or any enforcement action taken that was not timely appealed or, if appealed, the appeal was dismissed, within the previous 36-month period. (For purposes of this subsection, repeat violation does not include each day in violation being counted as a separate violation.) To constitute a repeat violation, the violation need not be the same violation as the prior violation. Violation of a written order of the hearing examiner that has been served as provided in this chapter shall also constitute a repeat violation. Repeat violations will incur double the civil penalties set forth in subsections (D)(1) and (2) of this section. If violations are repeated a third or subsequent time within a 36-month period, the penalties will be five times those set forth above. The city also has authority to suspend or revoke a business license when a responsible party is repeatedly doing work in violation of city regulations (Chapter 5.01 MICC).
    4. Deliberate Violation. If a violation was deliberate, the result of blatant disregard for direction from the city or knowingly false information submitted by the property owner, agent or their contractor, civil penalties will be incurred at double those set forth above in subsections (D)(1) through (3) of this section.
    5. Voluntary Compliance. The director may reduce penalties at their discretion, if voluntary compliance is achieved. The remaining penalty shall reflect the significance and severity of the violation, whether or not the violation was deliberate, and the costs incurred by the city in enforcing a notice of violation, stop work order, or voluntary compliance agreement.
E. Suspension, Revocation or Limitation of a Permit. The director may suspend, revoke or limit any permit issued whenever:
    1. The permit holder has committed a code violation in the course of performing activities subject to that permit;
    2. The permit holder has interfered with the director in the performance of his or her duties relating to that permit;
    3. The permit was issued in error or on the basis of materially incorrect information supplied to the city by the permit holder; or
    4. Permit fees or costs were paid to the city by check and returned from a financial institution marked nonsufficient funds (NSF) or canceled.
Such suspension, revocation or modification shall be carried out through the civil violation provisions of this chapter and shall be effective upon the compliance date established by the notice of violation. Such revocation, suspension or cancellation may be appealed to the hearing examiner using the appeal provisions of this chapter. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the director may immediately suspend operations under any permit by issuing a stop work order.
F. Hold on Future Permits. The director may place a hold on the issuance of future permits on a property if:
    1. A notice of violation or stop work order has been issued; and
    2. The appeal period has passed, or an appeal was brought but it was dismissed; and
    3. The violation has not been corrected and/or penalties or fines have not been paid; and
    4. The permits relate to the violation.
A hold on future permits will prevent the issuance of any land use or building permit for the subject property, and for the person responsible on any other property within the city, until the violation is resolved, corrective actions are taken and penalties are paid. The director may use their discretion to issue exceptions to this subsection for emergencies or hazardous situations, or other situation they deem reasonable.
G. Notice on Title. The director may file a notice with the King County recorder’s office, or its successor agency, if:
    1. A notice of violation or stop work order has been issued; and
    2. The appeal period has passed, or an appeal was brought but it was dismissed; and
    3. The violation has not been corrected and/or penalties or fines have not been paid; and
    4. The violation relates to real property owned by the responsible party.
The notice shall inform the public of the presence of an unresolved notice of violation or stop work order on the subject property.
When all violations specified in the notice of violation have been corrected or abated, the director shall record within a reasonable time a release of notice with the King County recorder’s office, or its successor agency. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.060 Voluntary compliance agreements.
A. Timing. A voluntary compliance agreement (VCA) may be used to resolve code compliance cases, and may be entered into at any time before an administrative appeal is decided.
B. Contents. A VCA is a written contract between the person responsible for the violation and the city, where such person agrees to abate the violation within a specified time and according to specified conditions. The VCA shall be completed on a form approved by the director and the city attorney and shall, at minimum, include the following:
    1. The name and address of the person responsible;
    2. The street address or other description sufficient for identification of the building, structure, premises, or land upon which the violation has occurred or is occurring;
    3. A description of the violation(s) and a reference to the code(s) which has been violated;
    4. The necessary corrective action to be taken, and the date by which the correction must be completed;
    5. An agreement by the person responsible that the city may inspect the premises as may be necessary to determine compliance with the VCA;
    6. The reduced amount of the civil penalty, if any, that the person responsible is agreeing to pay to the city for the violation;
    7. A statement that the person responsible acknowledges that the violation occurred as described in the VCA and waives the right to an administrative or judicial hearing for appeal purposes; and
    8. An agreement by the person responsible that if the city determines that such person does not meet his or her obligations specified in the VCA, the city may impose any remedy authorized by this chapter, including, but not limited to:
        a. Assessment of civil penalties;
        b. Abatement of the violation;
        c. Assessment of all costs and expenses incurred by the city to pursue code enforcement and to abate the violation, including legal and incidental expenses; and
        d. Suspension, revocation, or limitation of a permit.
C. Waiver of Appeal. In consideration of the city’s agreement to enter into a VCA, the person responsible shall completely surrender and have no right to an administrative or judicial hearing, under this chapter or otherwise, regarding the matter of the violation and/or the required corrective action. The VCA is a final, binding agreement, it is not a settlement agreement, and its contents are not subject to appeal.
D. Amendment. The director may amend a VCA to grant an extension of the time limit for compliance, or a modification of the required corrective action, if the person responsible has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting the violation, but unforeseen circumstances or circumstances beyond the control of the person responsible render full and timely compliance under the original conditions unattainable. Such request shall be made in writing by the person responsible and clearly establish the need for such an amendment. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.070 Stop work orders.
A. Issuance. The director shall issue a stop work order if the director finds that:
    1. The work is not authorized by a valid permit or inaccurate information was used to obtain the permit; or
    2. The permittee is not complying with the terms or conditions of the permit or approved plans, including storm water management and erosion control requirements, conditions of a seasonal development deviation, tree protection, construction impact mitigation plan; or
    3. Previously unknown contamination of site soils from hazardous materials is encountered and poses a potential risk to human health and the environment; or
    4. Adverse weather is causing significant problems on or off site; or
    5. The work is adversely affecting the public health, safety, or welfare; or
    6. The work is a hazard to property or is adversely affecting, or could adversely affect, adjacent property including: a right-of-way, a drainage way, a watercourse, an environmentally critical area, a storm water facility or a storm water treatment and flow control best management practice; or
    7. Otherwise materially impairs the director’s ability to secure compliance with the MICC.
The stop work order shall state the reasons for the order, specify the violation(s) and prohibit any work or other activity at the site. The stop work order may be appended to, or incorporate by reference, a notice of violation. However, issuance of a notice of violation is not a condition precedent to the issuance of a stop work order. A stop work order shall be served consistent with MICC 6.10.040 and shall take effect immediately upon service.
B. Effect. When a stop work order has been issued, posted and/or served pursuant to this section, it is unlawful to conduct the activity or perform the work covered by the order, even if the order has been appealed, until the director has removed the copy of the order, if posted, and issued written authorization for the activity or work to be resumed. Any violation of a stop work order is hereby declared to be a nuisance and the director is authorized to enjoin or abate such nuisance by any legal or equitable means available. The costs, specifically including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, for the injunction or abatement, shall be recovered by the city from the person responsible for the code violation in the manner provided by law. Failure to comply with the terms of a stop work order subjects the person responsible for the code violation to civil penalties and costs as set forth in this chapter, including a monetary penalty that shall accrue for each day that a violation of a stop work order occurs.
C. Appeal. A stop work order may be appealed according to the procedures prescribed by MICC 6.10.090. During any such appeal, the stop work order shall remain in effect. Failure to appeal the stop work order within the applicable time limits renders the stop work order a final determination that the civil code violation occurred and that work was properly ordered to cease.
D. Removal of a Stop Work Order. When a stop work order has been posted in conformity with the requirements of this chapter, removal of such order without the authorization of the city, or the hearing examiner if the matter has been heard by the hearing examiner, is unlawful and a violation. The director will remove the stop work order and write a letter of authorization to resume work only when the director finds that the reason for the order has been resolved or abated. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.080 Abatement.
A. Abatement. Upon consultation with the city attorney and prior approval by the city manager, the city may abate a condition which was caused by or continues to be a code violation when:
    1. The terms of the voluntary correction agreement pursuant to this chapter have not been met; or
    2. A notice of violation or stop work order has been issued, the period for filing an appeal with the hearing examiner has expired, and the required correction has not been completed; or
    3. A notice of violation or stop work order has been issued, a timely appeal was filed, the appellant failed to appear at the scheduled hearing or a hearing was held as provided in this chapter and the required correction has not been completed by the date specified by an order of the hearing examiner; or
    4. The condition is subject to abatement as provided for in this chapter or other provisions of city or state law.
B. Summary Abatement. Other provisions in this chapter notwithstanding, when a code violation causes a condition, the continued existence of which constitutes an immediate and emergent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare or to the environment, the city may summarily, and without prior notice to the person responsible, abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement.
C. Authorized Action by the City. Using any lawful means, the city may enter upon the subject property and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The city may seek judicial process as it deems necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition.
D. No Cause of Action Against City. No cause of action shall lie against the city or its agents, officers, or employees for actions reasonably taken, or not taken, to prevent or cure any immediate threats. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.090 Appeals.
A. Administrative Appeal – Filing Requirements. Persons named in a notice of violation or stop work order, or any owner of the land where the violation for which such a notice or order is issued, may file with the city clerk a notice of appeal within 14 days of the service of the notice or order. The notice of appeal shall be made in writing using the appropriate city form, clearly explaining the basis for the appeal, and shall include the applicable appeal fee as established in a fee schedule adopted by the Mercer Island city council.
B. Administrative Appeal – Procedures. 
    1. Upon receipt of the appeal, the city shall schedule an appeal hearing before the hearing examiner. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter3.40MICC and the rules of procedure of the hearing examiner.
    2. Enforcement of a notice of violation issued pursuant to this chapter shall be stayed as to the appealing party during the pendency of any administrative appeal under this section, except when the director determines that the violation poses a significant threat of immediate and/or irreparable harm and so states in any notice issued.
    3. Enforcement of a stop work order issued pursuant to this chapter shall not be stayed during the pendency of any administrative appeal under this section.
    4. When multiple stop work orders or notices of violation have been issued for any set of related facts constituting various violations, their appeals may be consolidated.
C. Administrative Appeal – Final Order. 
    1. Following review of the evidence submitted, if the examiner finds that no violation has occurred, the hearing examiner shall uphold the appeal and reverse the notice of violation or stop order. If the hearing examiner finds that a violation has occurred, the hearing examiner shall issue an order to the person responsible for the violation which includes the following information:
        a. The decision regarding the alleged violation including findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision;
        b. The required corrective action;
        c. The date by which the correction must be completed; and
        d. The civil penalties assessed based on the provisions of this chapter and the fee resolution;
    2. If an owner of property where a violation has occurred has affirmatively demonstrated that the violation was caused by another person or entity not the agent of the property owner and without the property owner’s knowledge or consent, such property owner shall be responsible only for abatement of the violation.
D. Effect of Decision. The decision of the hearing examiner shall constitute the final decision of the city, and the failure to comply with the decision of the hearing examiner, unless the decision is appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or up to 90 days’ imprisonment, or both. In addition to criminal punishment pursuant to this section, the city may pursue collection and abatement as authorized by law. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

6.10.100 Recovery of penalties and costs.
A. Payment. Any monetary penalties or costs assessed pursuant to this chapter constitute a personal obligation of the person responsible for the violation. In addition, the monetary penalties or costs assessed pursuant to this chapter may be assessed against the property that is the subject of the enforcement action. The city attorney is authorized to collect the monetary penalty or costs by use of appropriate legal remedies, the seeking or granting of which shall neither stay nor terminate the accrual of additional per diem monetary penalties so long as the violation continues.
B. Recovery of Costs. All reasonable expenses incurred by the city in abating a violation shall be billed to the person responsible for the violation and shall become due and payable to the city within 30 calendar days from the date of the bill. Such costs may include, but are not limited to, the following:
    1. Legal expenses, which shall include, but are not limited to:
        a. Personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney’s fees and all costs incurred by the city attorney’s office or its designee;
        b. Actual and incidental expenses and costs incurred by the city in preparing notices, contracts, court pleadings, and all other necessary documents; and
        c. All costs associated with retention and use of expert witnesses or consultants.
    2. Abatement expenses, which shall include, but are not limited to:
        a. Costs incurred by the city for preparation of notices, contracts, and related documents;
        b. All costs associated with inspection of the abated property and monitoring of said property consistent with orders of compliance issued by the city’s hearing examiner or a court of competent jurisdiction;
        c. All costs incurred by the city for hauling, storage, disposal, or removal of vegetation, trash, debris, dangerous structures or structures unfit for occupancy, potential vermin habitat or fire hazards, junk vehicles, obstructions to public rights-of-way, and setback obstructions;
        d. All costs incurred by law enforcement or related enforcement agencies;
        e. All costs incurred by the city during abatement of nuisance and code violations may include interest in an amount as prescribed by law.
    The city manager or designee, or the hearing examiner, may in their discretion waive in whole or part the assessment of any costs upon a showing that abatement has occurred or is no longer necessary or that the costs would cause a significant financial hardship for the person responsible for the violation. Any challenge to the amount of the legal or abatement costs must be made within 14 days of issuance of the bill and shall be heard by the hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall make a determination as to whether or not the city’s costs were accurate and necessary for correcting the violation.
C. Use of Collection Agency. Pursuant to RCW 19.16.500, as currently enacted or hereafter amended, the city may, at its discretion, use a collection agency for the purposes of collecting penalties and costs assessed pursuant to this chapter. The collection agency may add fees or interest charges to the original amount assigned to collections as allowed by law.
D. Continuing Duty to Abate Violations. Payment of a monetary penalty or costs pursuant to this chapter does not relieve the person responsible for the violation of the duty to correct or abate the violation. Additional notices of violation may be issued and/or criminal charges filed for continuing failure to correct or abate a violation. (Ord. 18C-06 § 2 (Att. A)).

For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
“Affected employee” means a full-time employee who begins his or her regular work day at a single worksite for an affected employer between 6 am and 9 am (inclusive) on two or more weekdays for at least 12 continuous months. Seasonal agricultural employees, including seasonal employees of processors of agricultural products, are excluded from the count of affected employees.
“Affected employer” means an employer that employs 100 or more full-time employees at a single worksite, within the city of Mercer Island, who are scheduled to begin their regular work day between 6 am and 9 am (inclusive) on two or more weekdays for at least 12 continuous months. Construction worksites, when the expected duration of the construction is less than two years, are excluded from this definition.
“Baseline measurement” means the survey of affected employers to determine the drive-alone rate and vehicle miles traveled per employee at the worksite. The city uses this measurement to develop commute trip reduction goals for the affected employer. The baseline measurement must be conducted in a manner that meets the requirements specified by the city.
“Carpool” means a motor vehicle, including a motorcycle, occupied by two to six people of at least 16 years of age traveling together for their commute trip, resulting in the reduction of a minimum of one motor vehicle commute trip.
“City” means the city of Mercer Island.
“Commute trips” means trips made from a worker’s home to an affected worksite on weekdays.
“Compressed work week” means an alternative work schedule, in accordance with employer policy, that regularly allows a full-time employee to eliminate at least one work day every two weeks by working longer hours during the remaining days, resulting in fewer commute trips by the employee. This definition is primarily intended to include weekly and bi-weekly arrangements, the most typical being four 10-hour days or 80 hours in nine days, but may also include other arrangements.
“CTR” is the abbreviation of commute trip reduction.
“CTR plan” or “commute trip reduction plan” means the city’s plan authorized by MICC 10.71.020.
“CTR program” means an affected employer’s city-approved strategies to reduce employees’ drive-alone trips and average VMT per employee.
“Drive-alone or single-occupant vehicle” means a motor vehicle occupied by one person for commute purposes, including a motorcycle.
“Employee transportation coordinator (ETC)” means a person who is designated as responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of an employer’s CTR program.
“Full-time employee” means a person, other than an independent contractor, whose position is scheduled on a continuous basis for 52 weeks for an average of at least 35 hours per week.
“Good faith effort” means that an employer has met the minimum requirements identified in RCW 70.94.531 and this chapter, and is working collaboratively with the city to continue its existing CTR program or is developing and implementing program modifications likely to result in improvements to its CTR program over an agreed-upon length of time.
“Implementation” means active pursuit by an employer of the CTR goals of RCW 70.94.521 through 70.94.555 and this chapter as evidenced by appointment of an employee transportation coordinator (ETC), distribution of information to employees regarding alternatives to drive-alone trips, and commencement of other measures according to its approved CTR program and schedule.
“Proportion of drive-alone trips” or “drive-alone rate” means the number of commute trips over a set period made by employees in single-occupancy vehicles divided by the number of actual commute trips by employees working during that period.
“Single worksite” means a building or group of buildings on physically contiguous parcels of land or on parcels separated solely by private or public roadways or rights-of-way.
“Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per employee” means the sum of the individual vehicle commute trip lengths in miles made by employees over a set period divided by the number of employees during that period. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

10.71.020 City of Mercer Island CTR plan.
The city manager or his/her designee shall adopt and administer a commute trip reduction plan that will regulate affected employers’ CTR programs, and set CTR goals for affected employers that are consistent with this chapter. The city will review the CTR plan each year and update the CTR plan as necessary and at least once every four years. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

10.71.030 Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any affected employer within the corporate limits of the city of Mercer Island. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

C. Affected employers shall identify themselves to the city within 90 days of becoming an affected employer.
D. Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement from the city, an affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to the city.

E. If an affected employer has a city-approved CTR program in place at the time of the initial effective date of this chapter, that program shall remain effective until the program’s next scheduled update. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

C. If an employer satisfies the requirements in subsection A of this section and subsequently employs 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an unaffected employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

10.71.060 Requirements for employers.
Every affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and drive-alone trips. Each affected employer’s CTR program must include the mandatory elements as described in MICC 10.71.070 and the additional program elements as required in MICC 10.71.080. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

The ETC and/or designee’s name, location, and telephone number must be prominently displayed physically or electronically at each affected worksite. The ETC shall oversee all elements of the employer’s CTR program and act as liaison between the employer and the city. The objective is to have an effective transportation coordinator presence at each worksite; an affected employer with multiple sites may have one ETC for all sites.
B. Information Distribution. Information about alternatives to drive-alone trips as well as a summary of the employer’s CTR program shall be provided to employees at least once a year and to new employees at the time of hire.

M. Provision of bicycle parking facilities, lockers, changing areas, and showers for employees who bicycle or walk to work;
N. Provision of a program of parking incentives such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities;
O. Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes which reduces commute trips;
P. Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed work week, which reduces commute trips;
Q. Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities, emergency taxi services, or guaranteed ride home programs;
R. Charging employees for parking, and/or the elimination of free parking; and
S. Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

10.71.090 CTR program report and description.
A. Affected employers shall review their program and file a biennial CTR program report and description with the city in accordance with the format and schedule provided by the city. The CTR program report and description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for the reporting period. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements.
B. At a minimum, the employer’s CTR program report and description must include:
    1. A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;
    2. The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;
    3. Documentation on compliance with the mandatory CTR program elements as described in MICC 10.71.070;
    4. Description of any additional elements included in the employer’s CTR program (as described in MICC 10.71.080); and
    5. A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer’s established goals.
C. Document Review. The city shall review each affected employer’s proposed CTR program within 90 days of receiving it from an affected employer. The city will approve, reject, or request modifications to the proposed CTR program within the 90-day review period unless the city provides written notification to the affected employer that the city will extend the review period by no more than 90 days. If the city does not expressly approve, reject, or request modifications to the proposed CTR program within the review period, the proposed CTR program will be deemed accepted. In the event the city requires modifications to the CTR program within a certain time frame or otherwise extends the review period, the implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.
D. Modification of CTR Program Elements. 
    1. Employer-Requested Modifications. Any affected employer may submit a request to the city for modification of its approved CTR program. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exists:
        a. The affected employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or
        b. The affected employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.
    The city may ask the affected employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request.
    2. City-Required Modifications. 
        a. If an affected employer meets either the drive-alone or VMT goals established in the CTR plan, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program;
        b. If an affected employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required;
        c. If an affected employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable drive-alone or VMT reduction goal, the city shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program report and description, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The city shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the city will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the city within 10 working days of the conference.
E. Extensions. An affected employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description and report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice directed to the city manager or his/her designee at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The city shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s biennial reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the city. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

10.71.100 Biennial measure of employee commute behavior.
In addition to the baseline measurement, affected employers shall conduct a survey as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect commute trip reduction program employee questionnaires (surveys) to all affected employees at least once every two years, and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from affected employees in the city of Mercer Island.

10.71.120 Exemptions and goal modifications.
A. Worksite Exemptions. An affected employer may request the city to grant an exemption from any or all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with some or all the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if, and only if, the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement any measures that could reduce the proportion of drive-alone trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by the city at any time based on a written request provided by the affected employer. The request should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from some or all the requirements of this chapter. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The city shall review annually all affected employers receiving exemptions, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.
B. Employee Exemptions. Employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a worksite’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. The city will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of affected employee exemption requests. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The city shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.
C. Modification of CTR Program Goals. 
    1. An affected employer may request that the city modify its CTR program goals. Such requests shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description or biennial report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program.
    2. The city will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines.
    3. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after city approval of its initial program description or biannual report. (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

10.71.130 Civil monetary penalties.
A. Each day an affected employer violates this chapter shall constitute a separate violation and shall be considered a Class I infraction pursuant to RCW 7.80.120. The penalty for a violation shall be $50 per day.
B. No affected employer with an approved CTR program which has made a good faith effort will be required to pay a civil monetary penalty solely for its failure to reach its applicable drive-alone or VMT goal.
C. An affected employer shall not be liable for civil monetary penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they:
    1. Propose to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and
    2. Advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the city and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with state law (RCW 70.94.531). (Ord. 09C-10 § 2).

The city shall issue a final decision on the reconsideration request within 10 city business days of the completion of the conference. Any action seeking judicial review of the final decision must be filed within 14 days from the date the decision is rendered.

B. Easements. Copies of all executed easements associated with the side sewer application must accompany the application. Where a side sewer is to be installed across a separate legally established lot from which the side sewer will serve, the applicant for the side sewer permit must first show proof that a duly executed easement has been obtained from the owner of the lot and recorded with the King County recorder’s office. The property owners shall have all easement(s) recorded with King County before a permit will be issued for construction, in a format approved by the city engineer.
C. Required Information. In making application for a side sewer permit, the applicant shall furnish an approved drawing showing the size and location of structures on the property, the owner’s name, address and legal description of the property to be served, and the location of any easements. The full course of the proposed side sewer from the public sewer in the street to the structure shall be shown on the drawing.

Prior to the issuance of a side sewer permit, the city engineer shall establish that a sewer main of sufficient size and suitable type and condition is available for the connection. A permit, which includes side sewer work in a right-of-way or public sewer easement, will only be issued to a licensed side sewer contractor. A permit that includes side sewer work only on private property may be issued to the owner or to a licensed side sewer contractor. Other than a licensed side sewer contractor, the owner is the only person authorized to install and repair side sewers on private property.
By accepting the side sewer permit, the property owner acknowledges that the inspector or authorized representatives shall be permitted to enter upon all and any premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspection, observation, measuring, sampling, testing of sewers and sewage waste, and performing all other acts or duties as they relate to the side sewer permit.
C. The contractor’s side sewer permit shall be available on the project site and must be readily accessible to the city engineer.
D. Permits expire two years from the date of issuance. The property owner may petition the city for an extension of the permit for up to one year, provided the city receives payment for any applicable fees. Open applications for permits shall be canceled by the city within one year from the date of submittal if the applicant fails to submit any requisite or additional information requested by the city.
E. If an application for a permit is denied, the property owner may appeal the city engineer’s decision by submitting a written application for appeal, together with the applicable fees, within 14 days of the date of denial. The appeal will be heard before the city’s hearing examiner. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.050 Ownership.
A. City Ownership of Sewer Facilities. The sewer system is owned and operated by the city, except to the extent that private ownership is otherwise indicated as a matter of record. Such public facilities typically include mains, pump stations or manholes.
B. Private Ownership of Area Sewers. Side sewers are owned by the property owner. Property owners shall be responsible for the development, maintenance, and repairs of side sewers and their appurtenances. Side sewers, whether located in a public or private place, shall be owned, installed, operated, and maintained by the owner or occupant of the property or premises served unless otherwise described in an easement, maintenance agreement or other legal document. This includes the pipe system up to, but not including, manufactured tees/wyes, or mechanical connections to the public main. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.060 Required connections.
All structures which contain facilities for the disposal of sewage shall be connected to the public sewer system. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.070 Engineering and design standards.
A. General. The property owner is responsible for providing an adequate and qualified design for the installation of all sewer facilities required by this code.
B. Sewer Facility Requirements. Whenever property is developed or redeveloped, sewer mains shall be extended through and to the extremes of the property being developed, as required by the city, when needed for the orderly extension of the public sewer system. Whenever property is developed or redeveloped in any way such that sewage discharge is changed in content or volume, new sewer facilities shall be required whenever necessary to:
    1. Meet hydraulic capacity requirements; or
    2. Replace or relocate existing facilities as required or authorized by the city; or
    3. Meet industrial waste pretreatment requirements.
C. Side Sewer Design. 
    1. A maximum of six residential properties may be connected to a single side sewer. When a side sewer serves more than one property, all of the following shall be required:
        a. A cleanout immediately upstream of the connection between the shared side sewer and individual side sewer;
        b. Installation of a backwater valve on each side sewer;
        c. Connection to the public sewer system shall be made with manhole with minimum inside diameter of 48 inches.
    2. Where physical conditions render compliance with city side sewer requirements impracticable, the city may require compliance insofar as is reasonably possible; provided, that the property owner(s) execute and deliver to the city an instrument, in a form furnished by the city, agreeing to hold harmless and indemnify the city for any damage or injury resulting from such installation. The city may require that such instrument be recorded against the property with the King County recorder’s office. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.080 Construction requirements.
A. Standards. Construction standards shall be as described in this chapter and the city’s standard drawings. The city engineer may designate the manner and place where the side sewer shall connect to the public sewer system, specify the material, size and grade of the side sewer, and determine whether or not a permit is needed.
B. Side Sewer Construction. 
    1. Side sewers shall be constructed as described in this chapter and the city’s standard drawings. All side sewers shall be laid on a minimum slope of one-quarter-inch of fall per linear foot for four-inch diameter pipe and a minimum of one-eighth-inch of fall per linear foot for six- inch diameter pipe or greater. The city engineer may waive this requirement only if the following circumstances have been met:
        a. A backwater valve is installed on all side sewers; and
        b. The property owner of the side sewer shall assume all responsibility for the effective operation of any backwater valve; and
        c. The property owner submits a release in a form approved by the city engineer in which the property owner agrees to hold the city harmless from any and all damage resulting therefrom.
    2. The property owner shall be responsible for determining the available grade between building drain and sewer tee or stub.
    3. In any case where the building is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, the same shall be lifted by artificial means and discharged into the public sewer.
    4. All connections shall be made to the wye or stub out assigned at the time the permit is issued, and no side sewer belonging to another owner shall be used unless written permission for such use is obtained and presented with the side sewer application.
    5. If a building sewer is to serve more than one property, all property owners shall execute and record a valid easement and maintenance agreement which include assurances that all the properties involved have perpetual use of the side sewer, and provisions for maintenance and access for repair purposes.
    6. If a side sewer is to serve two or more residential units, the use of a six-inch diameter pipe shall be specified. A six-inch cleanout extending to within 12 inches of the ground surface will be required at the wye where the upper-grade connections are made.
    7. All side sewers servicing a single residential unit shall be of a four-inch diameter pipe or larger. All side sewers servicing multiple dwellings, commercial establishments, schools, or any building other than single-family residences shall be of a six-inch diameter pipe or larger and the city engineer may require a manhole connection at the sewer main.
    8. Any existing connections to a septic tank, cesspool or privy vault will be removed and direct connection made to the building. In all cases, such cesspool or septic tank shall be properly disinfected and filled with suitable material or removed.
    9. The city engineer may allow the use of any existing side sewer, if it conforms to all existing codes and standard drawings in cases where a new or converted building replaces an existing building.
    10. All water front side sewers, or any other side sewers within the hydraulic gradient area shall include a cleanout at a point two feet above the lake front sewer maximum hydraulic gradient. The cleanout shall consist of a wye and a riser, both of the same size as the side sewer located in the hydraulic gradient area. The riser shall be extended to within 12 inches of finished grade and capped with an approved mechanical plug.
    11. Whenever a side sewer is to be abandoned, said sewer shall be capped at the connection to the public sewer system with a mechanical plug or other means acceptable to the city engineer.
C. Pipe Materials. 
    1. The following types are acceptable for standard side sewer installations:
        a. Plain concrete.
        b. Reinforced concrete.
        c. Solid wall polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
        d. Ductile iron, cement mortar lined, push-on joint, or mechanical joint, class 50 (minimum).
        e. Solid wall high density polyethylene (HDPE).
    2. Side sewers on lake front lines, or areas within the hydraulic gradient area, shall be six-inch ductile iron pipe for that area located between the lake front connection and a point two feet above the maximum hydraulic gradient as determined under emergency overflow conditions. Joints shall be rubber gasket, either mechanical or restrained. Between the point two feet above the hydraulic gradient and house connection, the installation will be standard. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.090 Inspections and tests.
A. Service Sewer Test. Side sewers shall be tested for leakage in the presence of the city engineer in accordance with the standard drawings and current version of the Washington State Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge and Municipal Construction.
B. Tentative Test. The property owner may conduct a tentative test prior to backfilling the trench at the time of inspection of the pipe-laying. However, the final acceptance test for leakage shall be made following backfill of all but the inspection tee, so that the complete backfill load will be on the pipe. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.100 Sewer system maintenance.
The city is responsible for the maintenance of the public sewer system. Owners of private sewer systems, side sewers, and backwater valves are solely responsible for maintenance and operation of such. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.110 Rates, fees and charges.
A. Establishment. The city shall establish rates, charges and fees for sewer use and related services; such rates are in addition to connection charges and fees for specific services. The city may establish classifications of customers or service, using any method or methods authorized by law.
B. Adjustments. The rates, fees and charges shall be evaluated periodically as part of the review and adoption of the biennial budget. The finance director may recommend adjustments as necessary and justified to meet revenue requirements, and the city shall adjust the schedule for said rates, fees and charges accordingly.
C. Computation, Meters Required. Rates and charges for all property owners shall be measured by water consumed on the premises, whatever the source of such water, and the same shall be metered by a public utility meter.
Charges against all property to which service is available shall begin upon connection or occupancy. Charges against property having new construction shall begin 90 days after connection, occupancy following the valid issuance of a occupancy permit, or measured water consumption, whichever occurs earliest. Sewage disposal service charges shall be computed and billed separately and shall become due and payable by the due date. The director of finance may suspend sewer charges after commencement of construction or extensive reconstruction where water service has previously been installed, when the premises are incapable of being occupied due to such construction or reconstruction.
D. Water Leakage. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of hidden or underground water leakage, the director of finance may adjust the sewage charge to the premises for water so lost; provided, that no such adjustment shall be made for leakage occurring more than four months prior to the date of application.
E. Delinquency. All charges unpaid before the first day of the next succeeding bimonthly billing charge shall be deemed delinquent. Delinquent charges may accrue interest and penalties. Delinquent charges, penalties and interest thereon so certified shall be a lien against the property to which such sewage disposal service charges are applicable. As an additional and concurrent method of the collection of any such sewerage rate or charge, the city may cut off the water service or supply from the property to which such rate or charge for sewerage has attached until such rates and charges are paid in full.
F. Sprinkling or Irrigation. Water metered exclusively for irrigation sprinkling or fire service by premises will not be charged correspondingly for sewer. If a property owner can provide proof which shows that a portion of all water used is lost by evaporation, irrigation, sprinkling or other cause, and has a “deduct” meter or comparable measuring device to enable measurement of the amount of water so used or lost, no charge shall be made for sewerage because of water so used or lost, except that in no case will the minimum charge be adjusted or reduced. The proof provided and the deduct meter or comparable measuring device must be approved by the finance director.
G. Liability for Sewage Disposal Charges. The city’s sanitary sewer collection system operates on a ready-to-serve or availability-to-serve basis and, therefore, all structures are subject to sewage disposal service charges whether or not occupied or connected. Liability for sewage disposal charges shall only be terminated when structures are condemned or razed and the water meter has been certified by the city as being removed. If a property owner wishes to terminate service and relieve his property from liability for future sewage disposal charges, the property owner shall notify the city not less than 30 days prior to the proposed termination date.
H. Installation and Permit Costs. The property owner shall be responsible for all installation costs and fees and charges for all requisite permits as set by the city, regardless of whether the work is done by the city or by the owner.
I. Connection Charges. 
    1. The city shall collect connection charges, in order that each connecting property shall bear its equitable share of the cost of the public sewer system. The connection charge is the property owner’s equitable share of the established costs of the facilities that the owner benefits from.
    2. Connection charges shall be paid before a property is allowed to connect to the public sewer system. Connection charges not previously paid, such as charges for new facilities that directly benefit the property, shall be paid when the property undergoes, either at one time or cumulatively through more than one project, a substantial remodeling or more substantial improvement or if an improvement or cumulative improvements significantly impact downstream system capacity.
    3. Facilities costs that may be covered in a connection charge include, but are not limited to, stubs built from the sewer main to the property line, pump stations and mains.
    4. Connection charges that have been paid as a result of development activities on the property or through participation in an LID or ULID shall not be reassessed.
    5. The finance director is authorized to adjust the connection charges as needed. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.120 Dispute resolution of fees, costs and charges.
If a property owner or customer wishes to dispute any rate, fees or charges assessed under this section, the property owner shall file a written request within 14 days of the date of the bill to the finance director, together with any proof in support thereof. The finance director shall review the request submitted and respond via a written decision within 30 days. (Ord. 14C-03 § 2).

15.06.130 Industrial waste discharge.
A. General. The city has established a program intended to prevent, control and correct the discharge of fats, oils and greases, and industrial waste within the public sewer system which could cause blockages, operational failures or premature degradation of the public sewer system.
B. Pretreatment of Discharges. The city shall require the pretreatment of discharges to the public sewer system, except single-family residences, if necessary to prevent and/or correct hazardous, dangerous, or explosive conditions or blockage, operational failure or premature degradation of the public sewer system.

    1. Potable water, including water from water line flushing, hyperchlorinated water line flushing, fire hydrant system flushing, and pipeline hydrostatic test water. Planned discharges shall be dechlorinated to a total residual chlorine concentration of 0.1 parts per million or less, pH-adjusted, if necessary, and volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent resuspension of sediments in the storm water system;
    2. Lawn watering and other irrigation runoff are permitted, but the city discourages use in excessive amounts through its public involvement program;
    3. Dechlorinated swimming pool, spa, and hot tub discharges. These discharges shall be dechlorinated to a concentration of 0.1 parts per million or less, pH-adjusted and reoxygenated, if necessary, and volumetrically and velocity controlled to prevent resuspension of sediments in the storm water system. Discharges shall be thermally controlled to prevent an increase in temperature of the receiving water. Swimming pool cleaning wastewater and filter backwash shall not be discharged to the storm water system;
    4. Street and sidewalk wash water, water used to control dust, and routine external building wash down that does not use detergents are permitted, but the city discourages use in excessive amounts through its public involvement program;
    5. Non-storm water discharges covered by another NPDES or state waste discharge permit; provided, that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations; and provided, that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm water system;
    6. Other non-storm water discharges. The discharge shall be in compliance with the requirements of a pollution prevention plan reviewed and approved by the city, which addresses control of such discharges by applying AKART to prevent contaminants from entering surface or ground water.
D. Prohibition of Illicit Connections. The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain or surface water system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under the law at the time of the connection. A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the storm and surface water system, or allows such a connection to continue. (Ord. 17C-09 § 1; Ord. 09C-09 § 1).

15.09.050 Standards for new development and redevelopment.
A. The thresholds, definitions, minimum requirements and exceptions, adjustment, and variance criteria found in Appendix I of the NPDES Phase II municipal storm water permit, including the mandatory incorporated provisions of the 2012 manual (as amended in 2014) and any amendments thereto are hereby adopted by the city of Mercer Island as the minimum standards for storm water management. Furthermore, Minimum Requirement No. 5: On-site Stormwater Management of the aforementioned 2012 manual is amended as follows:
    1. Minimum Requirement No. 5 applies to projects that:
        a. Result in 2,000 square feet, or greater, of new plus replaced hard surface area; or
        b. Have a land disturbing activity of 7,000 square feet or greater; or
        c. Result in a net increase of impervious surface of 500 square feet or greater.
    2. For implementing Minimum Requirement No. 5, the on-site detention BMP is added to List No. 1 and List No. 2 for evaluation on all projects as follows:If all of the on-site stormwater management BMPs included on List #1 and List #2 are determined to be infeasible for roofs and/or other hard surfaces, on-site detention shall be required when applicable. On-site detention is required when the drainage from the site will be discharged to a storm and surface water system that includes a watercourse or there is a capacity constraint in the system. The on-site detention system shall be sized using the city’s standard on-site detention sizing table or other method approved by the city engineer. On-site detention is not required if the project discharges directly to Lake Washington or if findings from a 1/4 mile downstream analysis confirm that the downstream system is free of capacity constraints. However, the stormwater must still be conveyed to an existing storm and surface water system in an approved manner.
B. Additional Passive Spill Control Is Required. Projects that replace, modify, or construct a new driveway or parking area shall provide passive spill control for that area that receives runoff from pollution-generating impervious surfaces (PGIS) prior to discharge from the site or into a natural on-site drainage feature. The intent of this device is to temporarily detain oil or other floatable pollutants before they enter the downstream storm water system in the event of an accidental spill or illegal dumping. It shall consist of a tee section in a manhole or catch basin (or elbow when allowed by the city engineer). Note that in addition to this spill control requirement, other spill control requirements may be required for projects that exceed certain thresholds in the applicable manual.
C. All storm water site plans shall include an analysis of off-site storm water runoff and water quality impacts and shall mitigate these impacts as necessitated by the applicable manual. The analysis shall extend, where possible, a minimum of one-fourth of a mile downstream from the project. The existing and potential impacts to be evaluated and mitigated include but are not limited to the following:
    1. Excessive sedimentation;
    2. Streambank erosion;
    3. Discharges to ground water and/or their potential;
    4. Violations of water quality standards;
    5. Discharges of pollutants;
    6. Erosion;
    7. Flooding;
    8. Slope instability; and
    9. Other adverse impacts to water quality.
D. Adopted drainage basin plans may be used to modify and/or add to any or all of the minimum requirements for storm and surface water runoff. Basin plans may include requirements for additional runoff detention, retrofitting measures, BMPs, or other measures in order to achieve basin-wide pollutant, flooding, erosion or sedimentation reduction. Standards developed from basin plans shall not modify any of the above requirements until the basin plan has been formally adopted by the Mercer Island city council. (Ord. 17C-09 § 1; Ord. 09C-09 § 1; Ord. 95C-118 § 1. Formerly 15.09.030).

15.09.060 Exceptions.
Exceptions to the minimum requirements of the applicable manual may be granted prior to permit approval and construction. An exception may be granted by staff; provided, that a written finding of fact is prepared, that meets the following criteria:
A. The exception provides equivalent water quality protection and complies with the public interest; and that the objectives of safety, function, water quality protection and facility maintenance, based upon sound engineering principles, are fully met;
B. There exist special physical circumstances or conditions affecting the property such that the strict application of the provisions of the applicable manual would deprive the applicant of all economic use of the parcel of land in question, and every effort to find creative ways to meet the intent of the minimum standards has been made;
C. That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public health and welfare, nor injurious to other properties in the vicinity and/or downstream, and to the quality of waters of the state and city; and the exception is the least possible exception that could be granted to comply with the intent of the minimum requirements of the applicable manual. (Ord. 17C-09 § 1; Ord. 09C-09 § 1; Ord. 95C-118 § 1. Formerly 15.09.040).

15.09.070 Maintenance and inspection requirements.
A. All public and private storm water facilities required by the applicable manual to provide permanent storm water treatment and/or flow control shall be inspected and maintained in accordance with the standards contained in the applicable manual.
B. All storm water treatment and flow control facilities shall be inspected annually, but may be reduced based on inspection records.

“Restrictions” means as follows:
    1. The city shall limit water use to the level of or lower than “consumption” as defined by Seattle water department (SWD). Consumption is derived by SWD by computing annual consumption for the past preceding years and factoring in any forecasted growth.

B. The maintenance department shall, at the city manager’s direction, send a notice to the billing address or deliver to and/or post a notice at the service address advising customers of their water usage practices which exceed the water use restrictions and further advise that a water use restriction device may be installed in the customer service line in order to reduce consumption in the event of noncompliance with the water use restrictions.
C. The city manager is authorized to install a water restriction device on the city-side of the water meter serving any person or business who continues to use water in excess of that permitted by the water use restriction after receipt of two or more notices of excessive water use as provided for above. If the restriction device is removed by someone other than a member of the city maintenance department, the city manager may require the water service to be terminated to the property until compliance with the water use restrictions is guaranteed to the satisfaction of the city manager.

4. In the event that three (3) of the areas fail the test, the floor may be divided into eighty (80) equal areas in order to be more statistically accurate. In such event, a maximum of four (4) nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the eighty (80) area tests, if the system continues to fail, the building owner shall have the system altered to meet the 95% coverage requirement.
5. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communication to and from the outside of the building through the Regional 800 MHz Radio System. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within the grid area is not permitted. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the results kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.
6. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

19.01.010 Purpose.
The general purpose of this code is to protect and promote health, safety, and the general welfare through the regulation of development within the city of Mercer Island.
To that end, this code classifies the land within the city into various zones and establishes the use of land and nature of buildings within those zones; controls the form of plats and subdivisions; regulates the construction of commercial and residential structures; and protects critical and sensitive areas within the city.
The provisions of this code are designed to consider light, air and access; to conserve and protect natural beauty and other natural resources; to provide coordinated development; to avoid traffic congestion; to prevent overcrowding of land; to facilitate adequate provisions for transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks and other public requirements; and to encourage the use of solar energy practices.
This code is to be interpreted as a whole, in view of the purpose set out in this section.
If the general purpose of this development code conflicts with the specific purpose of any chapter of this development code, the specific purpose shall control. (Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

19.01.020 Validity.
If any section, paragraph, subsection, clause or phrase of this code is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portion of this code. The city council hereby declares that they would have passed this code and each section, paragraph, subsection, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, paragraphs, clauses, or phrases were unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

19.01.030 Reasonable accommodation.
A. Eligibility. Any person claiming to have a handicap or disability, within the meaning of the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA), 42 U.S.C. 3602(h) or the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), Chapter 49.60 RCW, or someone acting on his or her behalf, who wishes to be excused from an otherwise applicable requirement of this development code pursuant to the requirement of the FHAA, or the WLAD, that reasonable accommodations be made in rules, policies, practices, or services when such accommodations may be necessary to afford persons with handicaps or disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, shall make such request for reasonable accommodation to the code official.
B. Procedure. 
    1. An applicant for reasonable accommodation must provide verifiable documentation of handicap or disability eligibility to the code official and describe the need for and proposed accommodation.
    2. The code official shall determine what adverse land use impacts, including cumulative impacts, if any, would result from granting the proposed accommodation. This determination shall take into account the size, shape and location of the dwelling unit and lot; the traffic and parking conditions on adjoining and neighboring streets; vehicle usage to be expected from the residents, staff and visitors; and any other circumstances determined to be relevant.
    3. The applicant’s need for accommodation shall be considered in light of the anticipated land use impacts, and conditions may be imposed in order to make the accommodation reasonable in light of those impacts.
    4. A grant of reasonable accommodation permits a dwelling to be inhabited only according to the terms and conditions of the applicant’s proposal and the code official’s decision. If it is determined that the accommodation has become unreasonable because circumstances have changed or adverse land use impacts have occurred that were not anticipated, the code official shall rescind or modify the decision to grant reasonable accommodation.
    5. The code official shall act promptly on the request for accommodation and shall not charge any fee for responding to a request for accommodation.
    6. Nothing herein shall prevent the code official from granting reasonable accommodation to the full extent required by federal or state law.
    7. The code official’s decision shall constitute final action by the city on a request for accommodation, and review of the decision will be available only in superior court. Any appeal must be filed not more than 21 days after the issuance of the code official’s decision. (Ord. 03C-08 § 2; Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

B. The location and boundaries of the various zones of the city are shown and delineated on the city of Mercer Island Zoning Map which is set out in Appendix D of this development code and is incorporated herein by reference.
C. The location and boundaries of the various zones as hereafter determined by the city council shall be shown and delineated on zone maps covering portions of the city, each of which maps shall be a part of this code either by adoption as a part hereof or by amendment hereto.
D. Each zone map and all notations and other information shown thereon shall become part of this code.
E. A zone map may be divided into parts and each part may, for purposes of identification, be subdivided into units. Such parts may be separately and successively adopted by means of an amendment of this code and, as adopted, such zone map, or its parts, shall become a part of this code.
F. Changes in the boundaries of a zone shall be made by ordinance adopting an amended map, or part of said zone map.
G. When uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zones shown on any zone map, the following rules shall apply:
    1. Boundaries shown on a map as approximately following street lines or lot lines shall be construed as actually following such lines.
    2. Where a boundary between zones divides a lot into two or more pieces, the entire lot shall be deemed to be located in the first zone on the following list in which any part of the lot is located: R-15, R-12, R-9.6, R-8.4, MF-2L, MF-3, MF-2, PI, PBZ, C-O, TC, and B. The location of the zone boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zone map unless the location of the boundary is indicated by dimensions.
    3. Where property abuts Lake Washington, the land use classification of the upland property extends waterward across the abutting shorelands and beds to the line of navigability/inner harbor line as established in 1984 by the board of natural resources by Resolution No. 461.
    4. In case any uncertainty exists, the planning commission shall recommend and the city council shall determine the location of boundaries.
    5. Where a public street is officially vacated or abandoned, the land use classification applicable to the abutting property shall apply to such vacated or abandoned street. If a vacated street forms the boundary between two or more zones, the land use classifications of each abutting zone shall extend to the mid-point of the vacated street unless the planning commission recommends and the city council decides otherwise.
H. Except as hereinafter provided:
    1. No land, building, structure or premises shall be used for any purpose or in any manner other than a use listed in this code, or amendments thereto, for the zone in which such land, building, structure or premises is located.
    2. No building or structure shall be erected nor shall any building or structure be moved, altered, enlarged or rebuilt, nor shall any open spaces surrounding any building or structure be encroached upon or reduced in any manner, except in conformity with the requirements of this development code or amendments thereto.
    3. No yard or other open spaces provided about any building or structure, for the purpose of complying with the regulations of this code or amendments thereto shall be considered as providing a yard or open space for any other building or structure. (Ord. 18C-05 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

19.01.050 Nonconforming structures, sites, lots and uses.
A. General. 
    1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to allow for the continuance and maintenance of legally established nonconforming structures, sites, lots and uses, and to provide standards delineating the circumstances in which nonconforming structures, sites, lots and uses must be brought into conformance with the provisions of all applicable code requirements.
    2. Legal Nonconforming Status of Structures, Sites and Uses. All structures, sites and uses that lawfully existed prior to September 26, 1960, shall be considered legally nonconforming. Structures, sites and uses that were constructed or initiated after September 26, 1960, that were in conformance with all applicable code provisions in effect at the time of their creation but are not in compliance with current land use codes as a result of subsequent changes in code requirements are deemed to be legally nonconforming structures, sites and uses.
    3. Illegal Nonconformance of Structures, Sites and Uses. Structures, sites and uses that were not in conformance with all applicable code provisions in effect at the time of their creation are illegal and shall be brought into compliance with all applicable provisions of this code.
    4. Continuation or Loss of Legal Nonconforming Status of Structures, Sites and Uses. A structure, site or use may be maintained in legal nonconforming status as long as no new nonconformances are created, there is no expansion of any existing nonconformity, and legal nonconforming status is not lost under any of the circumstances set forth in this section. If legal nonconforming status is lost, the structure, site or use must be brought into conformance with all applicable code requirements.
    5. Critical Areas. This section shall govern nonconforming structures, sites, lots and uses within any critical area, unless Chapter 19.07 MICC, Critical Lands, establishes more specific standards.
    6. Application of Codes. Nothing in this section in any way supersedes the requirements of the construction codes set forth in MICC Title 17, and any other construction-related codes as adopted and amended from time to time by the city.
    7. Deviations. Existing structures and sites resulting from the approval of a previous deviation shall be considered “conforming” structures or sites, provided the structure or site complies with the deviation approval.
B. Repairs and Maintenance. 
    1. Ordinary Repairs and Maintenance. Ordinary repairs and maintenance of a legally nonconforming structure are permitted. In no event may any repair or maintenance result in the expansion of any existing nonconformity or the creation of any new nonconformity.
    2. Decks. Repair and maintenance of a legally nonconforming deck, including total replacement, are allowed, as long as there is no increase in the legal nonconformity and no new nonconformances are created; provided, any portion of a nonconforming deck that is in a side yard and less than five feet from an interior lot line may be replaced only if the deck is reconstructed to comply with current minimum side yard requirements.
C. Interior Remodel. Interior remodeling of a legally nonconforming structure is permitted and will not result in loss of legal nonconforming status regardless of the cost or extent of the interior remodel, as long as no exterior alteration or enlargement is involved. If exterior alteration in conjunction with interior remodeling is involved, loss of legal nonconforming status will be determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in subsection D of this section.
D. Exterior Alteration or Enlargement of Nonconforming Structures. 
    1. Detached Single-Family Residential Structures. 
        a. Reconstruction Following Catastrophic Loss. Any legally nonconforming detached single-family dwelling and/or accessory building or structure that suffers a catastrophic loss shall not lose its legal nonconforming status. Such dwelling or accessory building or structure may be reconstructed regardless of the extent of damage or reconstruction cost, to re-establish the previous legal nonconformity or otherwise, as long as there is no expansion of any existing nonconformity, the reconstruction creates no new nonconformance, and a complete building permit for reconstruction is submitted to the city within 12 months of the date of the loss.
        b. Intentional Exterior Alteration or Enlargement. 
            i. Detached Single-Family Dwelling. A legally nonconforming detached single-family dwelling may be intentionally altered or enlarged without losing its legal nonconforming status as long as no more than 40 percent of the length of the dwelling’s existing exterior walls, excluding attached accessory buildings, is structurally altered. Any portion of the length of existing walls that is structurally altered shall be included in calculating the 40 percent threshold. In no event shall the alteration or enlargement increase any existing nonconforming aspect of the dwelling or create any new nonconformance. Legal nonconforming status shall be lost, and the structure shall be required to come into conformance with current code requirements, if the 40 percent threshold is exceeded. An increase in height of that portion of a structure that is legally nonconforming because it intrudes into a required yard is an increase in the nonconformity and is not allowed unless the additional height meets the current yard requirements of MICC 19.02.020(C)(1) except:
                (a) A change from a flat roof to a pitched roof is allowed under MICC 19.02.020(C)(3)(a); and
                (b) A height increase of a single-family dwelling and any accessory building or structure in the R-8.4 zone that is legally nonconforming because it intrudes into a minimum five-foot required side yard is allowed only if the additional height is modulated so that it is a minimum of 10 feet from the side yard property line.
            ii. Accessory Buildings or Structures. A legally nonconforming attached or detached accessory building or structure, including but not limited to a carport, garage, shed, gazebo, deck or fence, may be altered or enlarged without losing its legal nonconforming status as long as no more than 40 percent of its existing exterior perimeter (or length in the case of a fence) is structurally altered. A wall that is shared with the main dwelling shall not be included in the calculation for the attached accessory building. In no event shall any alteration or enlargement increase any existing nonconforming aspect of the building or structure or create any new nonconformance. Legal nonconforming status shall be lost, and the structure shall be required to come into conformance with current code requirements, if the 40 percent threshold is exceeded.
            iii. Structural Alteration Calculation. For the purposes of determining the percentage of exterior walls of a nonconforming structure that is being structurally altered, the following calculation applies:
            +----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
            | Formula: | Percentage of exterior walls altered = (sum of the length |
            |          | of existing exterior walls to be structurally altered)    |
            |          | ÷ (sum of the length of existing exterior walls)          |
            +----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
            Where:
                (a) The “sum of the length of existing exterior walls to be structurally altered” is the sum of each wall segment that is completely demolished.
                (b) The “sum of the length of exterior walls” is the sum of the lengths of each exterior wall segment of a structure or building.
                (c) For the purposes of this subsection, a wall segment is “completely demolished” when any portion of the wall is completely removed, such that no structural elements remain. 
                (d) For the purposes of this subsection, the “wall segment” is the horizontal length of each continuous exterior wall plane or façade; provided, that each building modulation (e.g., a bay window bump-out) shall be accounted for as a separate exterior wall plane. For example, the sum of the length of the exterior wall segments for a building that is a perfect cube with a dimension of 50 horizontal feet on each side of the house is 200 feet. The same building with a second story bay window bump-out dimensioned two feet by 10 feet by two feet has a sum of 214 feet.
            iv. Roof Repair and Replacement. The roof of a nonconforming structure may be repaired including total replacement; provided, that there is no expansion of any existing nonconformity. Repair or replacement of a roof does not constitute structural alteration of exterior walls.
            v. Cumulative Time Limit. The maximum cumulative structural alteration of a legally nonconforming structure, as described in subsections (D)(1)(b)(i) and (ii) of this section, is 40 percent within any five-year period. The five-year period includes the cumulative total of the work authorized by a permit application, and the work conducted within the five years immediately prior to demolition or construction authorized by the permit application. Legal nonconforming status shall be lost, and the structure shall be required to come into conformance with current code requirements, if the cumulative 40 percent threshold is exceeded within the five-year time limit.
    2. Town Center. 
        a. Reconstruction Following Catastrophic Loss. In the Town Center, a legally nonconforming structure which suffers a catastrophic loss may be reconstructed to its previous legally nonconforming configuration and appearance if the cost of the reconstruction equals or is less than 75 percent of the structure’s current King County assessed value as of the time the loss occurs and is reconstructed within the same building footprint, to the same number of stories, and to the same square footage of the legally nonconforming damaged or destroyed structure. If the damaged or destroyed portion of the structure is reconstructed to other than its previous nonconforming configuration and appearance, the entire structure shall lose its nonconforming status and shall be required to come into conformance with current code requirements; however, minor changes in appearance that bring it into closer conformity with current code requirements shall not result in overall loss of nonconforming status. In any event, if the 75-percent threshold is exceeded, legal nonconforming status shall be lost and the structure shall be required to come into conformance with current code requirements.
        b. Intentional Exterior Alteration or Enlargement. Legal nonconforming status of a structure in the Town Center is lost, and the structure shall be required to come into conformance with current code requirements, if there is any intentional exterior alteration or enlargement of a structure that costs in excess of 50 percent of the structure’s current King County assessed value as of the time the initial application for such work is submitted. No structure may be altered or enlarged so as to increase the degree of nonconformity or create any new nonconformance.1 
    3. Nonconforming Structures Other Than Single-Family or in Town Center. 
        a. Reconstruction Following Catastrophic Loss. Any legally nonconforming structure not covered under subsections (D)(1) or (2) of this section, that suffers a catastrophic loss may be reconstructed to its previous legally nonconforming configuration regardless of the extent of damage or reconstruction cost. No structure may be reconstructed so as to increase the degree of its nonconformity or create any new nonconformance. Regulated improvements reconstructed to their previous legally nonconforming configuration shall be subject to partial design review as provided by MICC 19.12.010(D)(2); however, no condition may be imposed by the design commission or code official which would have the effect of reducing the number of units contained in a multiple-family dwelling prior to the catastrophic loss.
        b. Intentional Exterior Alteration or Enlargement. Legal nonconforming status of any legally nonconforming structure not covered under subsection (D)(1) or (2) of this section is lost, and the structure and site shall be required to come into conformance with all current code requirements, including design review, if there is an intentional exterior alteration or enlargement of the structure over any three-year period that incurs construction costs in excess of 50 percent of the structure’s current King County assessed value as of the time the initial application for such work is submitted; provided, application of this subsection shall not be construed to require an existing structure to be demolished or relocated, or any portion of an existing structure that is otherwise not being worked on as part of the construction to be altered or modified. If there is no current King County assessed value for a structure, a current appraisal of the structure, which shall be provided by the applicant and acceptable to the code official, shall be used as the value point of reference. No structure may be altered or enlarged so as to increase the degree of nonconformity or create any new nonconformance.
E. Abandonment of a Legally Nonconforming Structure or Use. 
    1. Structure. A legally nonconforming structure shall be deemed to be abandoned, and shall lose its legal nonconforming status and be required to come into conformance with current code requirements, after the structure has been unoccupied continuously for 12 months or more, unless it is listed on the state or federal register of historic buildings or meets the criteria for a historic building pursuant to Chapter 16.01 MICC.
    2. Use. A legally nonconforming use shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall lose its legal nonconforming status, and any subsequent use shall be required to conform with current code requirements, after the use has been discontinued for 12 consecutive months or more.
    3. Exception. A structure that has been unoccupied continuously for 12 months or more, or a use that has been discontinued for 12 consecutive months or more, shall not be deemed abandoned if the owner of the structure can provide compelling evidence, to the satisfaction of the code official, that the structure is being actively marketed for sale or the owner of the structure otherwise has a reasonably timely and viable plan for resuming occupation of the property or resuming the legally nonconforming use.
F. Nonconforming Sites. 
    1. Impervious Surface Coverage Limitation. A structure on a site that is legally nonconforming because the maximum allowable surface coverage has been exceeded can be increased in height and gross floor area (up to the maximum permitted). No new impervious surfaces are permitted outside the footprint of an existing structure unless the site is either brought into conformance with all applicable impervious surface limitations or two square feet of legally existing impervious surface are removed for every one square foot of new impervious surface.
    2. Parking Requirements. These parking requirements apply to subsections (F)(2)(a) and (c) of this section in the event of an intentional exterior alteration or enlargement, but do not apply in the event of reconstruction following a catastrophic loss. In the event of catastrophic loss, nonconforming parking may be restored to its previous legally nonconforming configuration.
        a. Detached Single-Family Dwelling Site. A proposed addition of more than 500 square feet of gross floor area to a detached single-family dwelling site, which is legally nonconforming because it does not provide the number and type of parking spaces required by current code provisions, shall provide parking spaces as provided by MICC 19.02.020(G).
        b. Town Center. A structure in the Town Center that is legally nonconforming because it does not provide the number and type of parking spaces required by current code provisions shall provide parking spaces as required by MICC 19.11.130(B)(1)(a) and subsections (I)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable.
        c. Sites Other Than for a Detached Single-Family Dwelling or in Town Center. 
            i. New Development and Remodels. A site other than those identified in subsections (F)(2)(a) and (b) of this section that is legally nonconforming because it does not provide the number or type of parking spaces required by current code provisions shall provide parking spaces as required by the current code provisions for the zone where the site is situated for all new development and remodels greater than 10 percent of the existing gross floor area.
            ii. Change of Use. A site other than those identified in subsection (F)(2)(a) and (b) of this section that is legally nonconforming because it does not provide the number or type of parking spaces required by current code provisions shall provide parking spaces as required by the current code provisions for the zone where the site is situated whenever there is a change of use.
    3. Landscaping, Open Space and Buffer Requirements. 
        a. Regulated Improvements. A site developed with a regulated improvement shall be brought into conformance with current code requirements for landscaping, open space and buffers, whenever a structure or use on the site loses its legal nonconforming status. Landscaping, open spaces and buffers should be brought into conformance with current code requirements as much as is feasible whenever any changes are made to a legal nonconforming structure.
        b. Lot Coverage – Single-Family Dwellings. A site developed with a single-family dwelling that is legally nonconforming because the required landscaping area pursuant to Chapter 19.02 MICC has not been provided, or because maximum allowable hardscape has been exceeded, can be increased in height and gross floor area (up to the maximum height and gross floor area permitted). No new hardscape or further reduction in landscaping area is permitted unless:
            i. The site is either brought into conformance with all applicable lot coverage requirements of MICC 19.02.020; or
            ii. For lots where the maximum hardscape is exceeded, two square feet of legally existing hardscape are removed for every one square foot of new hardscape; or
            iii. For lots where the maximum lot coverage is exceeded, two square feet of landscaping area are provided for every one square foot of additional nonlandscaping area.
G. Nonconforming Lots. 
    1. Legally Nonconforming Lot. A nonconforming lot shall be deemed to be a legally nonconforming lot if the lot was legally created. In order to establish that a lot was legally created, an applicant seeking permit approval must provide:
        a. A long subdivision, short subdivision or plat approved by the city of Mercer Island or King County, separately describing and creating the lot in question; or
        b. A deed, contract of sale, mortgage, property tax segregation, or recorded survey separately describing and/or conveying the lot in question if the instrument was executed prior to July 18, 1960, and evidence that the creation of the lot was consistent with all codes in effect at the time of such conveyance or recording date.
    2. Illegal Nonconforming Lot. A lot which was not legally created in accordance with the laws of the local governmental entity in which it was located at the date of its creation is an illegal nonconforming lot and will not be recognized for development.
    3. Minimum Requirements for Development of Legally Nonconforming Lot. In order to be used as a building site, an undeveloped legally nonconforming lot must meet the following minimum requirements:
        a. The lot must exceed 3,500 square feet;
        b. The lot must have a minimum width of 30 feet and a minimum depth of 50 feet;
        c. The property owner must provide evidence that establishes that the lot was intended to be a building site at the time of its creation; and
        d. The lot must not be subject to consolidation pursuant to subsection (G)(5) of this section.
    If the owner provides proof to the satisfaction of the code official, demonstrating that the strict application of subsections (G)(3)(a) through (d) of this section prevents all reasonable use of the lot and that the owner was not involved in the creation of the legal nonconformity, such owner may be permitted to use the lot for one single-family residential dwelling, even if the lot does not meet the size, width, depth and other dimensional requirements of the zone, as long as all other applicable site, use and development standards are met or a variance from such site use or development standards has been obtained.
    4. Development of Legally Nonconforming Lot. Subject to the limitations of subsections (G)(3) and (5) of this section, a legally nonconforming lot may be developed for any use allowed by the zoning district in which it is located, even though such lot does not meet the size, width, depth and other dimensional requirements of the zone, as long as all other applicable site, use and development standards are met or a variance from such site use or development standards has been obtained.
    5. Consolidation. If, since the date on which it became nonconforming due to its failure to meet minimum lot size or width criteria, a legally nonconforming lot has been in the same ownership as a contiguous lot or lots, the nonconforming lot is and shall be deemed to have been combined with such contiguous lot or lots to the extent necessary to create a conforming lot and thereafter may only be used in accordance with the provisions of this code, except as specifically provided in subsection (G)(6) of this section.
    6. Continuation of Developed Legally Nonconforming Lot. A legally nonconforming lot that was developed as a separate and complete building site in accordance with the applicable laws at the time of development shall maintain its legal nonconforming status even if the lot has been in the same ownership as a contiguous lot or lots; provided, if separately developed, contiguously owned legally nonconforming lots are subsequently developed as one building site, the lots shall be deemed to be consolidated and may only be used as a single lot thereafter.
    7. No New Nonconformities Created. No nonconforming structure, site, lot or use shall be created as a result of the division of land or any modification of a lot line through any subdivision or lot line revision pursuant to Chapter 19.08 MICC.
H. Nonconforming Uses. 
    1. Change of Use. Any change from a legal nonconforming use shall be to a conforming use only; provided, the continuation of the same or similar use by the same or different owner will not result in loss of legal nonconforming status.
    2. Additional Uses Prohibited. While a legal nonconforming use exists on any lot, no separate or new use may be established thereon, even though such additional use would be a conforming one.
    3. Expansion of Legal Nonconforming Use. Legal nonconforming uses shall not be expanded or enlarged; however, if the code official determines that expansion or enlargement of the use or an accessory use (including parking) or other site modifications would make the use more conforming to current code standards or is required by city ordinance, state law, or federal law and no new nonconformity is created it may be allowed. Expansion includes increasing the size of the structure in which the use occurs or enlarging the scope, volume, area or intensity of the use in a significant way.
    4. Nonconforming Use Associated With Structure that Suffers Catastrophic Loss. In the event of catastrophic loss to a structure, the legal nonconforming status of any use contained in the structure shall not be lost, provided a complete building application to rebuild the structure and reestablish the nonconforming use is submitted within 12 months of the loss.
I. Change of Use – Town Center. 
    1. Single Tenant. If any applicant proposes a change of use on a lot used or occupied by a single tenant or use, the applicant shall meet those code provisions determined by the code official to be reasonably related and applicable to the change in use. These provisions shall apply to the entire lot. If the development is nonconforming due to the number of parking spaces provided for the existing use, any change in use which requires more parking than the previous use shall provide additional parking consistent with current code parking requirements.
    2. Multi-Tenant. If any applicant proposes a change of use on a portion of a lot occupied by multiple tenants or uses, the applicant shall meet those code provisions determined by the code official to be reasonably related and applicable to the change in use. These provisions shall apply only to that geographic portion of the lot related to the use or tenant space on which the change is proposed. If the multi-tenant lot is nonconforming due to the number of parking spaces provided for the existing uses, any change in use, which requires more parking than the previous use, shall provide additional parking consistent with current code parking requirements.
J. Enforcement. The provisions of this section requiring compliance with current code requirements for any illegal nonconforming structure, site or use, for any legally nonconforming structure, site or use that loses its nonconforming status and for any structure or use that is deemed abandoned shall be enforced pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 6.10 MICC.

    4. Setback Deviation. The code official may approve a deviation to front, side, and rear setbacks pursuant to MICC 19.15.040.
D. Gross Floor Area. 
    1. Except as provided in subsection (D)(3) of this section, the gross floor area shall not exceed:
        a. R-8.4: 5,000 square feet or 40 percent of the lot area, whichever is less.
        b. R-9.6: 8,000 square feet or 40 percent of the lot area, whichever is less.
        c. R-12: 10,000 square feet or 40 percent of the lot area, whichever is less.
        d. R-15: 12,000 square feet or 40 percent of the lot area, whichever is less.
    2. Gross Floor Area Calculation. The gross floor area is the sum of the floor area(s) bounded by the exterior faces of each building on a residential lot, provided:
        a. The gross floor area shall be 150 percent of the floor area of that portion of a room(s) with a ceiling height of 12 feet to 16 feet, measured from the floor surface to the ceiling.
        b. The gross floor area shall be 200 percent of the floor area of that portion of a room(s) with a ceiling height of more than 16 feet, measured from the floor surface to the ceiling.
        c. Staircases shall be counted as a single floor for the first two stories accessed by the staircase. For each additional story above two stories, the staircase shall count as a single floor area. For example, a staircase with a 10-foot by 10-foot dimension that accesses three stories shall be accounted as 200 square feet (100 square feet for the first two stories, and 100 square feet for the third story).
        d. For the purposes of calculating allowable gross floor area, lots created in a subdivision through MICC 19.08.030(G), Optional Standards for Development, may apply the square footage from the open space tract to the lot area not to exceed the minimum square footage of the zone in which the lot is located.
    3. Allowances. 
        a. The gross floor area for lots with an area of 7,500 square feet or less may be the lesser of 3,000 square feet or 45 percent of the lot area; or
        b. If an accessory dwelling unit is proposed, the 40 percent allowed gross floor area may be increased by the lesser of five percentage points or the actual floor area of the proposed accessory dwelling unit, provided:
            i. The allowed gross floor area of accessory buildings that are not partially or entirely used for an accessory dwelling unit shall not be increased through the use of this provision;
            ii. The lot will contain an accessory dwelling unit associated with the application for a new or remodeled single-family home; and
            iii. The total gross floor area shall not exceed 4,500 square feet or 45 percent of the lot area, whichever is less.
E. Building Height Limit. 
    1. Maximum Building Height. No building shall exceed 30 feet in height above the average building elevation to the highest point of the roof.
    2. Maximum Building Height on Downhill Building Facade. The maximum building facade height on the downhill side of a sloping lot shall not exceed 30 feet in height. The building facade height shall be measured from the existing grade or finished grade, whichever is lower, at the furthest downhill extent of the proposed building, to the top of the exterior wall facade supporting the roof framing, rafters, trusses, etc.
    3.  Antennas, lightning rods, plumbing stacks, flagpoles, electrical service leads, chimneys and fireplaces, solar panels, and other similar appurtenances may extend to a maximum of five feet above the height allowed for the main structure in subsections (E)(1) and (2) of this section; provided:
        a. Solar panels shall be designed to minimize their extension above the maximum allowed height, while still providing the optimum tilt angle for solar exposure. 
        b. Rooftop railings may not extend above the maximum allowed height for the main structure.
    4. The formula for calculating average building elevation is as follows:
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Formula: | Average Building Elevation = (Weighted Sum of the Mid-point        |
    |          | Elevations) ÷ (Total Length of Wall Segments)                      |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Where:   | Weighted Sum of the Mid-point Elevations = The sum of: ((Mid-point |
    |          | Elevation of Each Individual Wall Segment) x (Length of Each       |
    |          | Individual Wall Segment))                                          |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    For example for a house with 10 wall segments:
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | (Axa) + (Bxb) + (Cxc) + (Dxd) + (Exe) + (Fxf) + (Gxg) + (Hxh) + (Ixi) + (Jxj) |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j                                         |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    +--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Where: | A, B, C, D… = The existing or finished ground elevation, whichever |
    |        | is lower, at midpoint of wall segment.                             |
    +--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | And:   | a, b, c, d… = The length of wall segment measured on outside       |
    |        | of wall.                                                           |
    +--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

19.05.020 Parking requirements.
A. The following parking requirements apply to all uses in the PI zone.
B. General Requirements. 
    1. Surfacing and Grading. All off-street parking areas shall be graded and surfaced to a standard comparable to the street which serves the parking area. The parking area shall be developed and completed to the required standards before an occupancy permit for the building to be served is issued.
    2. Traffic Control Devices. All traffic control devices such as parking strips designating car stalls, directional arrows or signs, bull rails, curbs and other structures shall be installed and completed as shown on the approved plans. Hard surfaced parking areas shall use paint or similar devices to delineate parking stalls and directional arrows.
    3. Design. Parking lot design should conform to the diagrams set out in Appendix A of this development code, unless alternative design standards are approved by the design commission and city engineer.
    4. Location. Off-street parking shall be located on the same lot or on an adjoining lot or lots to the building to be served; except, that off-street parking may be located in an area beginning within 500 feet of the front entrance of the building to be served; provided, that there are no intersecting streets between the parking area and building to be served. This requirement does not apply to transit facilities.
    5. Ingress and Egress. The city engineer shall have the authority to fix the location and width of vehicular ingress or egress to and from property, and to alter existing ingress and egress as may be required to control street traffic in the interest of public safety and general welfare.
    6. Handicapped Standards. Off-street parking shall meet the relevant state design standards for the physically disabled.
    7. Compact Vehicles. Up to 50 percent of the required off-street parking spaces may be designed for accommodating compact vehicles. Such parking spaces must be clearly designated as compact stalls. The design commission may increase the percentage of compact stalls permitted if the applicant can demonstrate that no adverse impacts will occur.
    8. Loading Space. An off-street loading space, having access to a public street, shall be required adjacent to each building hereafter erected or enlarged. Such loading space shall be of adequate size to accommodate the maximum number and size of vehicles simultaneously loaded or unloaded, in connection with the business or businesses conducted in such building. No part of the truck or van using the loading space may project into the public right-of-way.
    9. Variances. Notwithstanding any of the minimum parking requirements set out in subsection C of this section, the code official may grant variances from the minimum parking requirements with the approval of the design commission and the city engineer for projects reviewable by the design commission.
C. Minimum Parking Requirements for Specific Uses.
    1. Government buildings shall provide one parking space per 200 square feet of gross floor area.
    2. Public elementary and middle schools shall provide a minimum of two parking spaces per classroom. Public high schools shall provide a minimum of one parking space per classroom plus an additional one parking space per 10 students. If the parking spaces that would need to be provided as specified above are in excess of the actual parking demands of the school’s staff, students, and visitors, the code official may allow a reduction in minimum parking requirements based on a parking analysis prepared by a qualified professional, with the approval of the city engineer and the design commission, for projects reviewable by the design commission.
D. Mixed Use Parking. In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use, except as hereinafter specified for cooperative use.
E. Cooperative Parking. Cooperative parking between two or more adjoining property owners is allowed; provided, the code official, with approval from the design commission and city engineer, may reduce the total required spaces by 25 percent of the total combined required spaces when the applicant has demonstrated that no adverse impact will occur due to the reduced number of stalls.
F. Parking Lot Dimension. All parking areas shall conform to the design standards set out in Appendix A of this development code unless alternative design standards are approved by the design commission and city engineer. (Ord. 18C-05 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 14C-06 § 4; Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

Other concealment methods include, but are not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and texture – or the appearance thereof – as the surface against which the installation will be seen or on which it will be installed, landscape design, or other camouflage strategies appropriate for the type of installation. Applicants are required to utilize designs in which all conduit and wirelines are installed internally in the structure or otherwise integrated into the design of the structure. Use of a unified enclosure equal to or less than four cubic feet in volume may be permitted in meeting these criteria. This requirement shall be applied in a manner which does not dictate the technology employed by the service provider nor unreasonably impair the technological performance of the equipment chosen by the service provider.
    2. If the code official has already approved a concealment plan either for the applicant or another wireless communications facility along the same public right-of-way or for the same pole type, then the applicant shall utilize a substantially similar concealment plan, unless it can show that such concealment plan is not physically or technologically feasible, or that such deployment would undermine the generally applicable design standards.
H. These design standards are intended to be used solely for the purpose of concealment and siting. Nothing herein shall be interpreted or applied in a manner which dictates the use of a particular technology. When strict application of these requirements would unreasonably impair the function of the technology chosen by the applicant, alternative forms of concealment or deployment may be permitted which provide similar or greater protections from negative visual impacts to the streetscape. (Ord. 19C-02 § 3 (Exh. A)).

    20. The temporary encampment managing organization shall obtain warrant and sex offender checks from the King County sheriff’s office for all current camp residents within the seven days prior to moving to Mercer Island, as well as from all new residents checking into the temporary encampment. If said check reveals the subject is a sex offender or has an active warrant, the temporary encampment managing organization or sponsor shall immediately contact the city of Mercer Island police department. The temporary encampment sponsor shall be responsible for verifying that the warrant and sex offender checks occur, that the log of persons residing at the temporary encampment is kept and that verifiable forms of identification are being provided.
    21. Upon determination that there has been a violation of any condition of approval, the code official may give written notice to the permit holder describing the alleged violation. Within seven days of the mailing of notice of violation, the permit holder shall show cause why the permit should not be revoked. At the end of the seven-day period, the code official shall sustain or revoke the permit.

C. Application Process. A temporary encampment permit is an administrative action. In addition to the requirements for the processing of administrative actions specified in Chapter 19.15 MICC, the following additional procedures shall apply:
    1. Informal Public Meeting Required. The code official shall require an applicant to conduct an informal public meeting to inform citizens about a proposed temporary encampment prior to submittal of an application. Notice of the informal public meeting shall be provided in the same manner as required for notice of the application, at least 10 days prior to the informal public meeting. Prior to the informal public meeting, the temporary encampment sponsor and managing organization shall meet and confer with the Mercer Island police department regarding any proposed security measures. At the informal public meeting, a representative of the temporary encampment sponsor and managing organization shall present in writing and describe the proposed temporary encampment location, timing, site plan, code of conduct, encampment concerns, management security measures, and any input or comment received on the plan, including any comment or input from the Mercer Island police department, or comment or input from schools and/or child care services under subsection (C)(2) of this section.

The temporary encampment sponsor and the school administration and/or child care service operator shall make a good faith effort to agree upon any additional conditions that may be appropriate or necessary to address school and/or child care concerns regarding the location of a temporary encampment within 600 feet of such a facility. Any such conditions agreed upon between the parties shall be submitted to the code official for consideration, for inclusion within the temporary encampment permit. In the event the parties fail to agree on any conditions, either party may provide the code official with a written summary of the parties’ discussions, which the code official may consider in evaluating whether the conditions for the temporary encampment permit are met, or the need for additional conditions upon the temporary encampment permit, without violating the legal rights of the temporary encampments sponsor.
D. Emergencies. The code official may waive these requirements when a catastrophic event necessitates the immediate establishment of a temporary encampment. (Ord. 10C-01 § 2).

19.06.100 Essential public facilities.
A. Purpose and Applicability. 
    1. This chapter establishes a process for identifying, siting and regulating essential public facilities (EPFs).
    2. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as precluding the siting of new EPFs, or the expansion or modification of existing EPFs, in contravention of applicable state law. This chapter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW, as now enacted or hereafter amended, and other applicable statutes and regulations.
    3. This chapter is intended to:
        a. Ensure that EPFs, as needed to support orderly growth and delivery of public services, are identified, sited and regulated for the public health, safety and welfare in a timely and efficient manner.
        b. Ensure that public services are available and accessible to Mercer Island and that the facilities are sited and constructed to provide those services in a timely manner.
        c. Provide the city with additional regulatory authority to require mitigation of impacts that may occur because of siting, operating, modifying, or expanding an EPF.
        d. Promote enhanced public participation that will produce EPF decisions consistent with community goals and the Comprehensive Plan.
B. Preapplication Meeting Required. Prior to submitting a conditional use permit application, an EPF applicant is required to attend a preapplication meeting consistent with the preapplication provisions of Chapters 19.09 and 19.15 MICC. The preapplication meeting is required as a means for applicants to present facility and siting proposals, seek information about potential sites, and propose possible mitigation measures.
C. Public Participation. The applicant shall present a public participation plan for city review and comment as part of the preapplication meeting. Applicants shall conduct local outreach efforts with early notification to prospective neighbors to inform them about the project and to engage residents in the development of the proposal, site planning and mitigation design prior to submittal of a conditional use permit application.
D. Conditional Use Permit Required. An EPF shall require a conditional use permit in all zones. Outside of the Town Center zone, an application for a conditional use permit shall follow the procedure and meet the criteria in Chapter 19.15 MICC. Within the Town Center zone, an application for a conditional use permit shall follow the procedure and meet the criteria in Chapter 19.15 MICC and MICC 19.15.040. In addition, regardless of the proposed location of the EPF, materials showing compliance with the following items must be submitted:
    1. Documentation of Need. The applicant must demonstrate the need for the proposed EPF. Included in the analysis of need should be the projected service population, an inventory of existing and planned comparable facilities and projected demand for this type of essential public facility.
    2. Consistency with Applicant’s Plans. The proposal shall be consistent with the applicant’s own long-range plans for facilities and operations.
    3. Consistency with Mercer Island Comprehensive Plan. The proposal shall be consistent with the Mercer Island Comprehensive Plan.
    4. Minimum Site Requirements. The applicant shall submit documentation showing the minimum siting requirements for the proposed facility. Site requirements may be determined by the following factors: minimum size of the facility, access, support facilities, topography, geology, and mitigation needs. The applicant shall also identify future expansion needs of the facility.
    5. Alternative Site Selection. The applicant shall search for and investigate alternative sites before submitting a proposal for conditional use permit approval. The proposal shall indicate whether any alternative sites have been identified that meet the minimum site requirements of the facility.
    6. Proposed Impact Mitigation. The proposal must include adequate, appropriate and reasonable mitigation measures for the impacted area(s) and community. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, natural features that will be preserved or created to serve as buffers, other site design elements used in the development plan, and/or operational or other programmatic measures contained in the proposal. The proposed measures shall be adequate to substantially reduce or compensate for anticipated adverse impacts created by the proposed facility.
E. Design Review Required. In addition to conditional use permit approval, design review pursuant to Chapter 19.15 MICC is required for any regulated improvements. Design review may be consolidated with the conditional use permit review pursuant to Chapter 19.15 MICC.
F. Independent Consultant Review. The code official may require independent consultant review of the proposal to assess its compliance with the criteria contained in this chapter, as well as the conditional use permit criteria. If independent consultant review is required, the applicant shall make a deposit with the city sufficient to defray the cost of such review. Unexpended funds, if any, will be returned to the applicant following the final decision on the application. (Ord. 17C-20 § 1).

        b. Change of Use. Modifications to the use shall require an amendment to the conditional use permit and shall be subject to the review process in Chapter 19.15 MICC.
B. Variances. 
    1. Purpose. An applicant or property owner may request a variance from any numeric standard, except for the standards contained within Chapter 19.07 MICC. A variance shall be granted by the city only if the applicant can meet all criteria in subsections (B)(2)(a) through (B)(2)(h) of this section. A variance for increased lot coverage for a regulated improvement pursuant to subsection (B)(2)(i) of this section shall be granted by the city only if the applicant can meet criteria in subsections (B)(2)(a) through (B)(2)(i) of this section.
    2. Criteria. 
        a. The strict enforcement of the provisions of this title will create an unnecessary hardship to the property owner. For the purposes of this criterion, in the R-8.4, R-9.6, R-12, and R-15 zoning designations, an “unnecessary hardship” is limited to those circumstances where the adopted standards of this title prevent the construction of a single-family dwelling on a legally created, residentially zoned lot;
        b. The variance is the minimum necessary to grant relief to the property owner;
        c. No use variance shall be allowed;
        d. There are special circumstances applicable to the particular lot such as the size, shape, topography, or location of the lot; or factors necessary for the successful installation of a solar energy system such as a particular orientation of a building for the purposes of providing solar access;
        e. The granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the property is situated;
        f. The granting of the variance will not alter the character of the neighborhood, nor impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property;
        g. The variance is consistent with the policies and provisions of the comprehensive plan and the development code;
        h. The basis for requesting the variance is not the direct result of a past action by the current or prior property owner; and
        i. Public and private schools, religious institutions, private clubs and public facilities in single-family zones with slopes of less than 15 percent may request a variance to increase the impervious surface to a maximum 60 percent impervious surface and such variance application will be granted if the hearing examiner determines that the applicant has demonstrated that the following criteria are satisfied:
            i. There will be no net loss of permeable surface from the existing permeable surface. No net loss will be determined by the code official and may be achieved by off-site mitigation and/or by reconstructing existing parking areas to allow storm water penetration. This replacement will be an exception to MICC 19.02.060(C)(2), prohibiting parking areas from being considered as permeable surfaces;
            ii. All storm water discharged shall be mitigated consistent with the most recent Washington State Department of Ecology Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington, including attenuation of flow and duration. Mitigation will be required for any and all new and replaced impervious surfaces. In designing such mitigation, the use of a continuous simulation hydrologic model such as KCRTS or WWHM shall be required; event based models will not be allowed. In addition, mitigation designs shall utilize flow control best management practices (BMPs) and low impact development (LID) techniques to infiltrate, disperse and retain storm water on site to mitigate the increased volume, flow and pollutant loading to the maximum extent feasible;
            iii. The director must approve a storm drainage report submitted by the applicant and prepared by a licensed civil engineer assuring the city that city infrastructure, in concert with the project design, is adequate to accommodate storm drainage from the project site, or identifying appropriate improvements to public and/or private infrastructure to assure this condition is met, at the applicant’s expense; and
            iv. The variance may not be used with other provisions to exceed this maximum 60 percent impervious surface coverage.
    3. Height Variance for a Wireless Communication Facility. If strict application of the provisions of MICC 19.06.040 would preclude an antenna from receiving or transmitting a usable signal, or, if the property owner believes that an alternative exists which is less burdensome to adjacent property owners, an application for a variance may be filed under the provisions of MICC 19.15.230(B). The code official may grant a height variance upon finding that the criteria in MICC 19.15.230(F) are met, and that one of the following criteria is also met:
        a. Compliance with the above provisions would prevent the antenna from receiving or transmitting a usable signal; and the alternative proposed constitutes the minimum necessary to permit acquisition or transmission of a usable signal; or
        b. The alternative proposed has less impact on adjacent property owners than strict application of the above provisions; or
        c. In Island Crest Park, if the parks director supports the variance because there will be a significant benefit to the park by either the retention of trees and/or vegetation or improvement of park uses.
    4. The code official may grant a variance, with restrictions if deemed necessary, from the four-acre limitation for purpose of permitting short subdivision of property containing more than four acres into four or less lots when all of the following circumstances shall be found to apply:
        a. That there are special circumstances applicable to the particular lot, such as type of ownership, restrictive covenants, physiographic conditions, location or surroundings, or other factors;
        b. That the granting of the variance will not result in future uncoordinated development nor alter the character of the neighborhood; and
        c. That granting the variance will not conflict with the general purposes and objectives of the comprehensive plan or the development code.
C. Setback Deviations. 
    1. Purpose. The purpose of a setback deviation is to increase protection of a critical area or critical area buffer. A setback deviation provides flexibility in designing a development proposal to allow for increased protection of critical areas or critical area buffer.
    2. Criteria. A setback deviation shall be granted by the city only if the applicant demonstrates all of the following:
        a. No use deviation shall be allowed;
        b. The granting of the deviation will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the property is situated;
        c. The granting of the deviation will not alter the character of the neighborhood, nor impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property;
        d. The deviation is consistent with the policies and provisions of the comprehensive plan and the development code;
        e. The basis for requesting the deviation is not the direct result of a past action by the current or prior property owner;
        f. The setback deviation is associated with the approval of development of a single lot or subdivision that is constrained by critical areas or critical area buffers;
        g. The building pad resulting from the proposed deviation will result in less impact to critical areas or critical area buffers; and
        h. Yard setbacks shall not be reduced below the following minimums:
            i. Front and rear setbacks may not be reduced to less than 10 feet each;
            ii. Side setbacks may not be reduced to less than five feet. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A)).

    5. Proposed grading;
    6. Description of impacts to the functions of critical areas; and
    7. Proposed monitoring plan.
A mitigation and restoration plan may be combined with a storm water control management plan or other required plan. Additional requirements that apply to specific critical areas are located in MICC 19.07.060, Geologic hazard areas; MICC 19.07.070, Watercourses; MICC 19.07.080, Wetlands; and MICC 19.07.090, Wildlife habitat conservation areas.
D. Storm water and erosion control management plan consistent with Chapter 15.09 MICC. Off-site measures may be required to correct impacts from the proposed alteration.
E. Other technical information consistent with the above requirements, as required by the code official.
The critical area study requirement may be waived or modified if the code official determines that such information is not necessary for the protection of the critical area. (Ord. 05C-12 § 5).

19.07.060 Geologic hazard areas.
A. Designation. All property meeting the definition of a geologic hazard area is designated as a geologic hazard area.
B. Buffers. There are no buffers for geologic hazard areas, but a geotechnical report is required prior to making alterations in geologic hazard areas. This provision shall not change development limitations imposed by the creation of building pads under MICC 19.09.090.
C. Geotechnical Review. 
    1. The applicant must submit a geotechnical report concluding that the proposal can effectively mitigate risks of the hazard. Consistent with MICC 19.07.050, the report shall suggest appropriate design and development measures to mitigate such hazards.
    2. The code official may waive the requirement for a geotechnical report when the proposed alteration does not pose a threat to the public health, safety and welfare in the sole opinion of the code official.
D. Site Development.
    1. Development Conditions. Alterations of geologic hazard areas may occur if the code official concludes that such alterations:
        a. Will not adversely impact other critical areas;
        b. Will not adversely impact (e.g., landslides, earth movement, increase surface water flows, etc.) the subject property or adjacent properties;
        c. Will mitigate impacts to the geologic hazard area consistent with best available science to the maximum extent reasonably possible such that the site is determined to be safe; and
        d. Include the landscaping of all disturbed areas outside of building footprints and installation of all impervious surfaces prior to final inspection.
    2. Statement of Risk. Alteration within geologic hazard areas may occur if the development conditions listed above are satisfied and the geotechnical professional provides a statement of risk with supporting documentation indicating that one of the following conditions can be met:
        a. The geologic hazard area will be modified, or the development has been designed so that the risk to the lot and adjacent property is eliminated or mitigated such that the site is determined to be safe;
        b. Construction practices are proposed for the alteration that would render the development as safe as if it were not located in a geologic hazard area;
        c. The alteration is so minor as not to pose a threat to the public health, safety and welfare; or
        d. An evaluation of site specific subsurface conditions demonstrates that the proposed development is not located in a geologic hazard area.
    3. Development Limitations. Within a landslide hazard area, the code official may restrict alterations to the minimum extent necessary for the construction and maintenance of structures and related access where such action is deemed necessary to mitigate the hazard associated with development.
    4. Seasonal Limitations. Land clearing, grading, filling, and foundation work within geologic hazard areas are not permitted between October 1 and April 1. The code official may grant a waiver to this seasonal development limitation if the applicant provides a geotechnical report of the site and the proposed construction activities that concludes erosion and sedimentation impacts can be effectively controlled on-site consistent with adopted storm water standards and the proposed construction work will not subject people or property, including areas off-site, to an increased risk of the hazard. As a condition of the waiver, the code official may require erosion control measures, restoration plans, and/or an indemnification/release agreement. Peer review of the geotechnical report may be required in accordance with subsection C of this section. If site activities result in erosion impacts or threaten water quality standards, the city may suspend further work on the site and/or require remedial action. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 05C-12 § 5).

19.07.070 Watercourses.

    +-------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | Restored or Piped | 25                     | Determined by the code official       |
    +-------------------+------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    2. Reduction of Buffer Widths.
        a. The code official may allow the standard buffer width to be reduced to not less than the above listed minimum width in accordance with an approved critical area study when he/she determines that a smaller area is adequate to protect the watercourse, the impacts will be mitigated by using combinations of the below mitigation options, and the proposal will result in no net loss of watercourse and buffer functions. However, in no case shall a reduced buffer contain a steep slope.
        b. The code official may consider the following mitigation options:
            i. Permanent removal of impervious surfaces and replacement with native vegetation;
            ii. Installation of biofiltration/infiltration mechanisms such as bioswales, created and/or enhanced wetlands, or ponds supplemental to existing storm drainage and water quality requirements;
            iii. Removal of noxious weeds, replanting with native vegetation and five-year monitoring;
            iv. Habitat enhancement within the watercourse such as log structure placement, bioengineered bank stabilization, culvert removal, improved salmonid passage and/or creation of side channel or backwater areas;
            v. Use of best management practices (e.g., oil/water separators) for storm water quality control exceeding standard requirements;
            vi. Installation of pervious material for driveway or road construction;
            vii. Use of “green” roofs in accordance with the standards of the LEED Green Building Rating System;
            viii. Restoration of off-site area if no on-site area is possible;
            ix. Removal of sources of toxic material that predate the applicant’s ownership; and
            x. Opening of previously channelized and culverted watercourses on-site or off-site.
    3. Averaging of Buffer Widths. The code official may allow the standard buffer width to be averaged if:
        a. The proposal will result in a net improvement of critical area function;
        b. The proposal will include replanting of the averaged buffer using native vegetation;
        c. The total area contained in the averaged buffers on the development proposal site is not decreased below the total area that would be provided if the maximum width were not averaged;
        d. The standard buffer width is not reduced to a width that is less than the minimum buffer width at any location; and
        e. That portion of the buffer that has been reduced in width shall not contain a steep slope.
    4. Restoring Piped Watercourses.
        a. Removal of pipes conveying watercourses shall only occur when the code official determines that the proposal will result in a net improvement of ecological functions and will not significantly increase the threat of erosion, flooding, slope stability or other hazards.
        b. Where the buffer of the restored watercourse would extend beyond a required setback the applicant shall obtain written agreement from the affected neighboring property owner. The city may deny a request to restore a watercourse if it results in buffers being adjusted and increased onto adjacent properties.
C. Impervious Surfaces. Impervious surface shall not be permitted within a watercourse or watercourse buffer except as specifically provided in this chapter.
D. Development Standards. 
    1. Type 3 watercourses may be relocated when such relocation results in equivalent or improved watercourse functions. Type 1 and 2 watercourses shall not be relocated except through the reasonable use exception.
    2. Existing watercourses shall not be placed into culverts except as provided by the allowed alterations or reasonable use exception. When culverts are allowed, they shall be designed to mitigate impacts to critical area functions. Oversize and open bottom culverts lined with rock that maintain a semi-natural stream bed are preferred to round culverts. (Ord. 08C-01 § 3; Ord. 05C-12 § 5).

19.07.080 Wetlands.
A. Wetland Designation. All property meeting the definition of a wetland in the Wetland Manual is designated as a wetland.
B. Wetland Ratings. Wetlands shall be rated as Category I, Category II, Category III or Category IV according to the wetland classification system.
C. Wetland Buffers.
    1. Standard Wetland Buffer Widths. The following standard buffer widths shall be established from the outer edge of wetland boundaries:
    +--------------+------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Wetland Type | Standard (Base) Buffer | Minimum Buffer Width with |
    |              |      Width (feet)      |    Enhancement (feet)     |
    +--------------+------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category I*  | 100                    | 50                        |
    +--------------+------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category II  | 75                     | 37                        |
    +--------------+------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category III | 50                     | 25                        |
    +--------------+------------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category IV  | 35                     | 25                        |
    +--------------+------------------------+---------------------------+
    *Note: There are no known Category I wetlands in the city.
    2. Reduction of Wetland Buffer Widths. The code official may allow the standard wetland buffer width to be reduced to not less than the minimum buffer width in accordance with an approved critical area study when he/she determines that a smaller area is adequate to protect the wetland functions, the impacts will be mitigated consistent with MICC 19.07.070(B)(2), and the proposal will result in no net loss of wetland and buffer functions.
    3. Averaging of Wetland Buffer Widths. The code official may allow averaging of the standard wetland buffer widths in accordance with the criteria of MICC 19.07.070(B)(3).
D. Alterations. Category III and IV wetlands of less than one acre in size may be altered if the applicant can demonstrate that the wetland will be restored, enhanced, and/or replaced with a wetland area of equivalent or greater function. In cases where the applicant demonstrates that a suitable on-site solution does not exist to enhance, restore, replace or maintain a wetland in its existing condition, the city may permit the applicant to provide off-site replacement by a wetland with equal or better functions. The off-site location must be in the same drainage sub-basin as the original wetland. (Ord. 05C-12 § 5).

19.07.090 Wildlife habitat conservation areas.
A. Designation. Bald eagles are the only endangered or threatened non-aquatic wildlife species known to inhabit Mercer Island and the city designates those areas used by these species for nesting, breeding, feeding and survival as wildlife habitat conservation areas. If other non-aquatic species are later added by the State Washington Fish and Wildlife Department as endangered or threatened as set forth in WAC 232-12-011 through 232-12-014, as amended, the city council will consider amending this section to add such species. The provisions of this section do not apply to any habitat areas which come under the jurisdiction of the city’s shoreline master program. The city’s watercourse, wetland and shoreline regulations in this chapter provide required protections for aquatic species.
B. Establishment of Buffers. For any wildlife habitat conservation area located within other critical areas regulated in this chapter, the buffers for those critical areas shall apply except where species exist that have been identified by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife as endangered or threatened. If such species are present, the applicant shall comply with all state or federal laws in connection with any alteration of the wildlife habitat conservation area and the code official may require a critical area study.
C. Seasonal Restrictions. When a species is more susceptible to adverse impacts during specific periods of the year, seasonal restrictions may apply. Activities may be further restricted and buffers may be increased during the specified season. (Ord. 05C-12 § 5).

19.07.100 Shoreline areas.
Repealed by Ord. 13C-12. (Ord. 08C-01 § 3; Ord. 05C-12 § 6; Ord. 02C-09 § 6; Ord. 99C-13 § 1. Formerly 19.07.050).

19.07.110 Shoreline master program.
A. Authority and Purpose. 
    1. Authority. This section is adopted as part of the shoreline master program of the city. It is adopted pursuant to the authority and requirements of Chapter 90.58 RCW and Chapter 173-26 WAC.
    2. Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to all uses, activities and development within the shorelands, unless specifically exempted. All proposed uses and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to Chapter 90.58 RCW, the Shoreline Management Act.
    3. Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose and intent of this section to achieve the shoreline master program (SMP) mandates of the state of Washington and to adopt property development standards within the shorelands that protect the health, safety, welfare, values and property interests of the city of Mercer Island and its residents.
    4. Relationship with Other Mercer Island Codes and Ordinances. This section is an integrated element of the city of Mercer Island Unified Land Development Code (MICC Title 19) and other applicable development regulations contained in the Mercer Island City Code, including the storm water management regulations in MICC Title 15, and building and construction regulations in MICC Title 17. The provisions of the critical areas ordinance (MICC 19.07.010 through and including 19.07.090 as in effect on January 1, 2011) are hereby incorporated as specific regulations of the shoreline master program. To the extent this section conflicts with any other section of the Mercer Island City Code, the provisions of this section shall govern within the shorelands.
    5. Relationship with Other Federal and State Law. The provisions of this section shall not relieve any responsibility to comply with other federal and state laws or permits. All work at or waterward of the OHWM may require permits from one or all of the following: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Washington Department of Natural Resources or Washington Department of Ecology.
B. General Regulations. 
    1. Legal Nonconforming Uses and Structures May Continue. Overwater uses and structures, and uses and structures 25 feet landward from the OHWM, which were legally created may be maintained, repaired, renovated, remodeled and completely replaced to the extent that nonconformance with the standards and regulations of this section is not increased.
    2. No Net Loss Standard and Mitigation Sequencing. No development shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates to the code official’s satisfaction that the shoreline development will not create a net loss of ecological function in the shorelands.
        a. Standards Presumed to Meet No Net Loss. When all individual development standards that apply to a development project do not explicitly require a determination of no net loss and the project conforms with all such standards, there is a rebuttable presumption that the project does not create a net loss of ecological function to the shorelands.
        b. No Net Loss Plan. Whenever an applicant seeks a variance or conditional use permit or an applicable development standard explicitly requires a determination of no net loss of ecological function, the applicant shall provide the city with a plan that demonstrates the proposed project will not create a net loss in ecological function to the shorelands. The plan shall accomplish no net loss of ecological function by avoiding adverse ecological impacts that are not reasonably necessary to complete the project, minimizing adverse ecological impacts that are reasonably necessary to complete the project, and mitigating or offsetting any adverse impacts to ecological functions or ecosystem-wide processes caused by the project. The code official may require the plan to include reports from qualified professionals with expertise in ecological function. The plan’s compliance with the no net loss requirement may be considered through the SEPA process.
            i. Off-Site Mitigation Permitted. While on-site mitigation is preferred, off-site mitigation may be permitted at the discretion of the code official.
            ii. Demonstration of No Net Loss Supported by a Qualified Professional. The code official may require any applicant to provide reports by qualified professionals that demonstrate to the code official’s satisfaction that the applicant’s proposed plan avoids a net loss in ecological function.
    3. Expansion of Legal Nonconforming Structures. Expansions of legal nonconforming overwater structures and structures upland 25 feet from the OHWM are permitted; provided, that the expanded structure is constructed in compliance with this section and all other standards and provisions of the Mercer Island development regulations.
    4. Shoreline Habitat and Natural Enhancements Held Harmless. In those instances where the OHWM moves further landward as a result of any action required by this section, or in accordance with permits involving a shoreline habitat and nature systems enhancement approved by the city, or a state or federal agency, the shoreline setback shall be measured from the location of the OHWM that existed immediately prior to the action or enhancement project.
C. Shoreline Map and Designations. The shoreline environmental designations map, dated March 3, 2011, as shown in Appendix F, is adopted as the official Mercer Island shoreline environmental designations map. The digital map is available in the online version of the Mercer Island City Code at http://www.mercergov.org. All shorelands within the city are designated. Different areas of the city’s shorelands have different natural characteristics and development patterns. As a result, two shoreline designated environments are established to regulate developments and uses consistent with the specific conditions of the designated environments and to protect resources of the Mercer Island shorelands. They are:
    1. Urban Park Environment. This environment consists of shoreland areas designated for public access and active and passive public recreation. The areas include, but are not limited to, parks, street ends, public utilities and other publicly owned rights-of-way. The uses located in this environment should be water-dependent and designed with no net loss to the ecological functions of the shorelands. Restoration of ecological functions is planned for these areas and is strongly encouraged. The preferred and priority use in the urban park environment is public access to, and enjoyment of, Lake Washington.
    2. Urban Residential Environment. The purpose of the urban residential environment is to provide for residential and recreational utilization of the shorelands, compatible with the existing residential character in terms of bulk, scale, type of development and no net loss of ecological functions of the shorelands. The preferred and priority use in the urban residential environment is single-family residential use.
D. Use Regulations. The following tables specify the shoreline uses and developments which may take place or be conducted within the designated environments. The uses and developments listed in the matrix are allowed only if they are not in conflict with more restrictive regulations of the Mercer Island development code and are in compliance with the standards specified in subsection E of this section.

    2. Bulkheads and Shoreline Stabilization Structures.
        a. An existing shoreline stabilization structure may be replaced with a similar structure if there is a demonstrated need to protect principal uses or structures from erosion caused by currents or waves, and the following conditions shall apply:
            i. The replacement structure should be designed, located, sized, and constructed to assure no net loss of ecological functions.
            ii. Replacement walls or bulkheads shall not encroach waterward of the ordinary high water mark or existing structure unless the primary structure was occupied prior to January 1, 1992, and there are overriding safety or environmental concerns. In such cases, the replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure. Soft shoreline stabilization measures that provide restoration of shoreline ecological functions may be permitted waterward of the ordinary high water mark.
            iii. For purposes of this section standards on shoreline stabilization measures, “replacement” means the construction of a new structure to perform a shoreline stabilization function of an existing structure which can no longer adequately serve its purpose. Additions to or increases in size of existing shoreline stabilization measures shall be considered new structures.
            iv. Construction and maintenance of normal protective bulkhead common to single-family dwellings requires only a shoreline exemption permit, unless a report is required by the code official to ensure compliance with the above conditions; however, if the construction of the bulkhead is undertaken wholly or in part on lands covered by water, such construction shall comply with SEPA mitigation.
        b. New Structures for Existing Primary Structures. New or enlarged structural shoreline stabilization measures for an existing primary structure, including residences, are not allowed unless there is conclusive evidence, documented by a geotechnical analysis, that the structure is in danger from shoreline erosion caused by currents, or waves. Normal sloughing, erosion of steep bluffs, or shoreline erosion itself, without a scientific or geotechnical analysis, is not demonstration of need. The geotechnical analysis should evaluate on-site drainage issues and address drainage problems away from the shoreline edge before considering structural shoreline stabilization. New or enlarged erosion control structure shall not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.
        c. New development should be located and designed to avoid the need for future shoreline stabilization to the extent feasible. This future shoreline stabilization standard does not apply to stabilization that occurs pursuant to subsection (E)(2)(a) of this section. New structural stabilization measures in support of new non-water-dependent development, including single-family residences, shall only be allowed when all of the conditions below apply:
            i. The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as the loss of vegetation and drainage.
            ii. Nonstructural measures, such as placing the development further from the shoreline, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient.
            iii. The need to protect primary structures from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report, in compliance with subsection (E)(2)(h) of this section. The damage must be caused by natural processes, such as currents and waves.
            iv. The erosion control structure will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.
        d. New development on steep slopes or bluffs shall be set back sufficiently to ensure that shoreline stabilization is unlikely to be necessary during the life of the structure, as demonstrated by a geotechnical analysis, in compliance with subsection (E)(2)(h) of this section and building and construction codes.
        e. New structural stabilization measures in support of water-dependent development shall only be allowed when all of the conditions below apply:
            i. The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as the loss of vegetation and drainage.
            ii. Nonstructural measures, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient.
            iii. The need to protect primary structures from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report, in compliance with subsection (E)(2)(h) of this section and building and construction codes.
            iv. The erosion control structure will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.
        f. New structural stabilization measures to protect projects for the restoration of ecological functions or hazardous substance remediation projects pursuant to Chapter 70.105D RCW shall only be allowed when all of the conditions below apply:
            i. Nonstructural measures, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient.
            ii. The erosion control structure will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions.
        g. Bulkheads shall be located generally parallel to the natural shoreline. No filling may be allowed waterward of the ordinary high water mark, unless there has been severe and unusual erosion within two years immediately preceding the application for the bulkhead. In this event the city may allow the placement of the bulkhead to recover the dry land area lost by erosion.
        h. Geotechnical reports pursuant to this section that address the need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure shall address the necessity for shoreline stabilization by estimating time frames and rates of erosion and report on the urgency associated with the specific situation. As a general matter, hard armoring solutions should not be authorized except when a report confirms that there is a significant possibility that such a structure will be damaged within three years as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of such hard armoring measures, or where waiting until the need is that immediate would foreclose the opportunity to use measures that avoid impacts on ecological functions. Thus, where the geotechnical report confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure, but the need is not as immediate as the three years, that report may still be used to justify more immediate authorization to protect against erosion using soft measures.
        i. When any structural shoreline stabilization measures are demonstrated to be necessary, pursuant to above provisions, the following shall apply:
            i. Limit the size of stabilization measures to the minimum necessary. Use measures designed to assure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions. Soft approaches shall be used unless demonstrated not to be sufficient to protect primary structures, dwellings, and businesses.
            ii. Ensure that publicly financed or subsidized shoreline erosion control measures do not permanently restrict appropriate public access to the shoreline except where such access is determined to be infeasible because of incompatible uses, safety, security, or harm to ecological functions. See public access provisions: WAC 173-26-221(4). Where feasible, incorporate ecological restoration and public access improvements into the project.
            iii. Mitigate new erosion control measures, including replacement structures, on feeder bluffs or other actions that affect beach sediment-producing areas to avoid and, if that is not possible, to minimize adverse impacts to sediment conveyance systems. Where sediment conveyance systems cross jurisdictional boundaries, local governments should coordinate shoreline management efforts. If beach erosion is threatening existing development, local governments should adopt master program provisions for a beach management district or other institutional mechanism to provide comprehensive mitigation for the adverse impacts of erosion control measures.
        j. The development of two or more dwelling units on a lot abutting the OHWM should provide joint use or community dock facilities, when feasible, rather than allow individual docks for each lot.
    3. Transportation and Parking.
        a. Shoreline circulation system planning shall include safe, reasonable, and adequate systems for pedestrian, bicycle, and public transportation where appropriate. Circulation planning and projects should support existing and proposed shoreline uses that are consistent with all regulations.
        b. Transportation and parking facilities shall be planned, located, and designed where routes will have the least possible adverse effect on unique or fragile shoreline features, and will not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or adversely impact existing or planned water-dependent uses.
        c. Where other options are available and feasible, new roads or road expansions should not be built within shorelands.
        d. Parking facilities in shorelands shall be allowed only as necessary to support an authorized use.
    4. Standards Waterward of the OHWM. Moorage facilities may be developed and used as an accessory to dwellings on shoreline lots. Only one noncommercial, residential moorage facility per upland residential waterfront lot authorized. The standards in Table D shall apply to development located waterward of the OHWM:

    5. The covered portion of a moorage shall be restricted to the area lying within a triangle as illustrated in Figure A, except as otherwise provided in subsection (E)(5)(a) of this section. The base of the triangle shall be a line drawn between the points of intersection of the property lateral lines with the ordinary high water mark. The location of the covered moorage shall not extend more than 100 feet from the center of the base line of such triangle. In cases where water depth is less than 11.85 feet from OHWM, the location of the covered moorage may extend up to 150 feet from the center of the base line or to the point where water depth is 11.85 feet at OHWM, whichever is less. The required 10-foot setbacks from the side property lines shall be deducted from the triangle area.
        a. A covered moorage is allowed outside the triangle, or a canopy up to 21 feet in height, if the covered moorage meets all other regulations and:
            i. Will not constitute a hazard to the public health, welfare, and safety, or be injurious to affected shoreline properties in the vicinity;
            ii. Will constitute a lower impact for abutting property owners; and
            iii. Is not in conflict with the general intent and purpose of the SMA, the shoreline master program and the development code.

    9. General Requirements. The following requirements apply to the following types of activities that may be waterward and/or landward of the OHWM:
        a. Critical Areas within the shorelands are regulated by MICC 19.07.010 through and including 19.07.090, as adopted in the MICC on January 1, 2011, except: MICC 19.07.030(B), Reasonable Use Exception, and 19.07.040(C), Setback Deviation, and (D), Variances.
        b. Utilities. 
            i. Utilities shall be placed underground and in common rights-of-way wherever economically and technically practical.
            ii. Shoreline public access shall be encouraged on publicly owned utility rights-of-way, when such access will not unduly interfere with utility operations or endanger public health and safety. Utility easements on private property will not be used for public access, unless otherwise provided for in such easement.
            iii. Restoration of the site is required upon completion of utility installation.
        c. Archaeological and Historic Resources. 
            i. If archaeological resources are uncovered during excavation, the developer and property owner shall immediately stop work and notify the city, the Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, and affected Indian tribes.
            ii. In areas documented to contain archaeological resources by the Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, a site inspection or evaluation is required by a professional archaeologist in coordination with affected Indian tribes.
        d. New development adding over 500 square feet of additional gross floor area or impervious surface, including the primary structures and appurtenances, shall be required to provide native vegetation coverage over 50 percent of the 20-foot vegetation area shown on Figure C. This standard shall apply to the total of all new impervious surface area added in the five years immediately prior to the construction of the gross floor area or impervious surface addition.
            i. New development over 1,000 square feet of additional gross floor area or impervious surface, including the primary structures and appurtenances, shall be required to provide native vegetation coverage over 75 percent of the 20-foot vegetation area shown in Figure C.
            ii. A shoreline vegetation plan shall be submitted to the city for approval.
            iii. The vegetation coverage shall consist of a variety of ground cover shrubs and trees indigenous to the central Puget Sound lowland ecoregion and suitable to the specific site conditions. Existing mature trees and shrubs, but excluding noxious weeds, may be included in the coverage requirement if located in the 20-foot vegetation area shown in Figure C.
            iv. No plants on the current King County noxious weed lists shall be planted within the shorelands.
F. Shoreline Permits. 
    1. Administrative Responsibility. Except as otherwise stated in this section, the code official is responsible for:
        a. Administering shoreline permits.
        b. Approving, approving with conditions or denying shoreline exemption permits, substantial development permits, shoreline conditional use permits, shoreline variances and permit revisions in accordance with applicable provisions.
        c. Determining compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act.
        d. No development shall be undertaken within the shorelands without first obtaining a shoreline exemption permit, substantial development permit, conditional use permit, and/or a variance permit in accordance with all applicable procedures unless it qualifies under a categorical exemption. In addition, such permit shall be in compliance with permit requirements of all other agencies having jurisdiction within the shorelands. Compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations is also required.
    2. Shoreline Categorical Exemption. Any development that qualifies as being a shoreline categorical exemption, as specified in this section, shall not require a shoreline permit, but must still meet all requirements of the Mercer Island Unified Land Development Code.
    3. Shoreline Exemption. 
        a. Shoreline Exemption Criteria. A shoreline exemption shall be granted to the following development as long as such development proposal is in compliance with all applicable requirements of this title and any of the following:
            i. Any development of which the total cost or fair market value, whichever is higher, does not exceed $7,047 or as periodically revised by the Washington State Office of Financial Management, if such development does not materially interfere with the normal public use of the water or shorelines of the state; or
            ii. Normal maintenance or repair of existing structures or developments, including damage by accident, fire or elements. “Normal maintenance” includes those usual acts established to prevent a decline, lapse, or cessation from a lawfully established condition. “Normal repair” means to restore a development to a state comparable to its original condition within a reasonable period after decay or partial destruction, including complete replacement of legally existing structures. Normal maintenance of single-family dwellings is categorically exempt as stated above; or
            iii. Construction of the normal protective bulkhead common to single-family dwellings. A “normal protective” bulkhead is constructed at or near the ordinary high water mark to protect a single-family dwelling and is for protecting land from erosion, not for the purpose of creating land. Where an existing bulkhead is being replaced, it shall be constructed no further waterward of the existing bulkhead than is necessary for construction of new footings; or
            iv. Emergency construction necessary to protect property from damage by the elements. An “emergency” is an unanticipated and imminent threat to public health, safety, or the environment which requires immediate action within a time too short to allow full compliance with this section; or
            v. Construction or modification of navigational aids such as channel markers and anchor buoys; or
            vi. Construction of a dock, designed for pleasure craft only, for the private noncommercial use of the owners, lessee, or contract purchaser of a single-family dwelling, for which the cost or fair market value, whichever is higher, does not exceed $10,000; or
            vii. Any project with a certification from the governor pursuant to Chapter 80.50 RCW; or
            viii. Projects for the restoration of ecological functions; or
            ix. Any development proposal that meets the shoreline substantial development exemptions identified in WAC 173-27-040 or Chapter90.58RCW, as amended.
        b. Shoreline Exemption Process. The city shall send the shoreline letter of exemption decisions to the applicant and all applicable local, state, or federal agencies as required by state or federal law.
    4. Substantial Development Permit Application Decision Criteria. A substantial development permit (SDP) is required for any development within shorelands that does not qualify as shoreline exempt. All requirements of the Mercer Island Unified Land Development Code shall apply to the approval of a shoreline substantial development permit.
    5. Shoreline Conditional Use Permit. The purpose of a shoreline conditional use permit is to provide a system which allows flexibility in the application of use regulations in a manner consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020. In authorizing a shoreline conditional use, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the city of Mercer Island or the Department of Ecology to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use and/or to assure consistency of the project with the Shoreline Management Act and the applicable city regulations.
        a. Shoreline Conditional Use Permit Application Decision Criteria. All requirements of the Mercer Island Unified Land Development Code shall apply to the approval of a shoreline conditional use permit. Uses that require a shoreline conditional use permit may be authorized; provided, that the applicant demonstrates all of the following:
            i. That the proposed use is consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the Mercer Island Uniform Land Development Code;
            ii. That the proposed use will not detrimentally interfere with the normal public use of shorelands within the “urban park environment” shoreline environment designation;
            iii. That the proposed use of the site and design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses allowed for the area by the Mercer Island Uniform Land Development Code;
            iv. That the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and
            v. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.
            vi. In applying the above criteria when reviewing shoreline conditional use applications, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if shoreline conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the shoreline conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.
    6. Shoreline Variance Criteria. Shoreline variances are strictly limited to granting relief from specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable regulations where there are extraordinary circumstances relating to the physical character or configuration of property such that the strict implementation of the regulations will impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policy enumerated in RCW 90.58.020. Shoreline variances for use regulations are prohibited. In addition, in all instances the applicant for a shoreline variance shall demonstrate strict compliance with all variance criteria set out in this section and the following additional criteria:
        a. In the granting of all shoreline variance permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if shoreline variances were granted to other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the shoreline variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.
        b. Shoreline variance permits for development that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark, and/or landward of any associated wetland, may be authorized, provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:
            i. That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable regulations precludes or significantly interferes with reasonable use of the property not otherwise prohibited;
            ii. That the hardship in this subsection is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of the applicable regulations, and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant’s own actions;
            iii. That the design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses in the area and will not cause adverse effects to adjacent properties or the shoreline environment;
            iv. That the requested shoreline variance does not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area, and is the minimum necessary to afford relief; and

Following preliminary approval, tree removal, grading, and installation of utilities shall be the minimum necessary to allow for final plat approval of the long or short subdivision.
        b. An existing lot, created through the final plat approval of a long or short subdivision, shall be a condition precedent for determination of complete application for a building permit to construct a new single-family dwelling. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-12 § 7; Ord. 10C-07 § 2; Ord. 08C-01 § 4; Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

19.08.030 Design standards.
A. Compliance with Other Laws and Regulations. The proposed subdivision shall comply with all other chapters of this title; the Shoreline Management Act; and other applicable city, state, and federal legislation.
B. Public Improvements. 
    1. The subdivision shall be reconciled as far as possible with current official plans for acquisition and development of arterial or other public streets, trails, public buildings, utilities, parks, playgrounds, and other public improvements.
    2. If the preliminary plat includes a dedication of a public park with an area of less than two acres and the donor has designated that the park be named in honor of a deceased individual of good character, the city shall adopt the designated name.
C. Control of Hazards. 
    1. Where the project may adversely impact the health, safety, and welfare of, or inflict expense or damage upon, residents or property owners within or adjoining the project, other members of the public, the state, the city, or other municipal corporations due to flooding, drainage problems, critical slopes, unstable soils, traffic access, public safety problems, or other causes, the city council in the case of a long subdivision, or the code official in the case of a short subdivision, shall require the applicant to adequately control such hazards or give adequate security for damages that may result from the project, or both.
    2. If there are soils or drainage problems, the city engineer may require that a Washington registered civil engineer perform a geotechnical investigation of each lot in the project. The report shall recommend the corrective action likely to prevent damage to the areas where such soils or drainage problems exist. Storm water shall be managed in accordance with Chapter 15.09 MICC and shall not increase likely damage to downstream or upstream facilities or properties.
    3. Alternative tightline storm drains to Lake Washington shall not cause added impact to the properties, and the applicant shall submit supportive calculations for storm drainage detention.
D. Streets, Roads and Rights-of-Way. 
    1. The width and location of rights-of-way for major, secondary, and collector arterial streets shall be as set forth in the comprehensive arterial plan.

    3. Private access roads shall meet the criteria set out in MICC 19.09.040.
    4. Streets of the proposed subdivision shall connect with existing improved public streets, or with existing improved private access roads subject to easements of way in favor of the land to be subdivided.
E. Residential Lots.
    1. The area, width, and depth of each residential lot shall conform to the requirements for the zone in which the lot is located. Any lot which is located in two or more zones shall conform to the zoning requirements determined by the criteria set out in MICC 19.01.040(G)(2).
    2. Each side line of a lot shall be approximately perpendicular or radial to the center line of the street on which the lot fronts.
    3. The proposed subdivision shall identify the location of building pads for each proposed lot per MICC 19.09.090. No cross-section dimension of a designated building pad shall be less than 20 feet in width.
    4. The proposed subdivision shall incorporate preferred development practices pursuant to MICC 19.09.100 where feasible.
    5. The proposed subdivision shall be designed to comply with the provisions of Chapter 19.10 MICC.
F. Design Standards for Special Conditions.

    2. Where critical areas meeting the criteria set out in Chapter 19.07 MICC are present within the subdivision, the code official or city council may:
        a. Require that certain portions of the long subdivision or short subdivision remain undeveloped with such restrictions shown on the official documents;
        b. Increase the usual building set-back requirements; and/or
        c. Require appropriate building techniques to reduce the impact of site development.
G. Optional Standards for Development. In situations where designing a subdivision to the requirements of subsections A through F of this section would substantially hinder the permanent retention of trees; interfere with the protection of critical areas; preclude the provision of parks, playgrounds, or other noncommercial recreational areas for neighborhood use and enjoyment; or negatively impact the physiographic features and/or existing ground cover of the subject area, the applicant may request that the project be evaluated under the following standards:
    1. The use of the land in the long subdivision or short subdivision shall be one permitted in the zone in which the long subdivision or short subdivision is located.
    2. The number of lots shall not exceed the number that would otherwise be permitted within the area being subdivided, excluding the shorelands part of any such lot and any part of such lot that is located in a street.
    3. An area suitable for a private or public open space tract shall be set aside for such use.
    4. The lots may be of different areas, but the minimum lot area, minimum lot width, and minimum lot depth shall each be at least 75 percent of that otherwise required in the zone in which the long subdivision or short subdivision is located. In no case shall the lot area be less than 75 percent of that otherwise required in the zone. Lot size averaging must be incorporated if lot width or depth requirements are 75 percent of the minimum that would otherwise be required for the zone without utilizing the optional development standards. Any designated open space or recreational tract shall not be considered a lot.
    5. The ownership and use of any designated open space or recreational tract, if private, shall be shared by all property owners within the long subdivision or short subdivision. In addition, a right of entry shall be conveyed to the public to be exercised at the sole option of the city council if such area shall cease to be an open space or recreational tract.
    6. The open space or recreational tract must remain in its approved configuration and be maintained in accordance with approved plans. Any deviation from the foregoing conditions must receive expressed approval from the hearing examiner. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 08C-01 § 4; Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

A. Streets, Utilities and Storm Drainage. A subdivision shall include provisions for streets, water, sanitary sewers, storm drainage, utilities and any easements or facilities necessary to provide these services. All utilities shall be placed underground unless waived by the city engineer. Detailed plans for these provisions shall not be required until after the approval of the preliminary plat and shall be a condition precedent to the official approval of the subdivision.
B. Performance Bond. The owner(s) of a project shall deposit with the city a performance bond or funds for a set-aside account in an amount equal to 150 percent of the cost of the required improvements, as established by the city engineer. Such security shall list the exact work that shall be performed by the owner(s) and shall specify that all of the deferred improvements shall be completed within the time specified by the city engineer, and if no time is so specified, then not later than one year. The city may also require a bond or set-aside account securing the successful operation of improvements or survival of required landscaping for up to two years after final approval.
C. Site Supervision. Any and all services performed by city employees in field inspection of construction of plat improvements, clearing, and/or grading processes, shall be charged to the developer at 100 percent of direct salary cost, plus 35 percent of such cost for overhead. Any outside consultants retained by the city to evaluate any phase of plat design or construction shall be charged at actual cost, plus any additional administrative costs. Billings tendered to the owner(s) shall be payable within 30 days.
D. Construction Seasons. Either the city engineer or the building official may:
    1. Limit the construction project to a specific seasonal time period.
    2. Prevent land clearing, grading, filling, and foundation work on lots with critical slopes or geologic hazard areas between October 1 and April 1, as set out in MICC 19.07.020; and

K. Care of Excavated Material. All material excavated from the right-of-way shall be maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the right-of-way, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using right-of-way and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the excavation or on the street, the city engineer shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul away all the excavated material. It shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for hauling and disposal of waste material.
L. Damage to Existing Improvements. All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the permitted activity shall be repaired by the permittee.

The city engineer’s presence during the performance of any work shall not relieve the permittee of its responsibilities under this section.
R. City’s Right to Restore Surface.
    1. If the permittee has failed to restore the surface of the street to its original and proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by such permit, or fails to prosecute the permitted activity in accordance with the requirements of this section, or has otherwise failed to complete the work covered by such permit, the city engineer, if he or she deems it advisable, shall have the right to do all work and things necessary to restore the street and to complete the work. The permittee shall be liable for the actual cost thereof plus 25 percent of such cost in addition for general overhead and administrative expenses.

AA. Work by the City. An annual right-of-way use permit will be issued to the city for activities included in its annual work program that occur in public rights-of-way and affect traffic.
BB. Liability of City. This section shall not be construed as imposing upon the city or any official or employee any liability or responsibility for damages to any person injured by the performance of any permitted activity for which a right-of-way permit is issued to any party other than the city under this section; nor shall the city or any official or employee thereof be deemed to have assumed any such liability or responsibility by reason of inspections authorized under this section, the issuance of any permit to any party other than the city or the approval of any permitted activity.

    5. Where property is subject to a long-term lease (in excess of 25 years) the signature of either the lessor or lessee shall be sufficient.
    6. In the case of property subject to a life estate, the signature of the holder of the life estate shall be sufficient.
    7. In the case of property owned by the estate of a decedent or incompetent, the signature of the duly qualified personal representative or guardian shall be sufficient.
C. Petition or Resolution for Vacation. The owners of an interest in real property abutting upon any city street who desire to vacate such street, or any part thereof, may petition the city council for vacation of the street, giving the description of the portion sought to be vacated; or the city council may itself initiate a vacation procedure by passing a city council resolution. The petition or resolution shall be filed with the city clerk. The proposed street vacation shall be processed by the city engineer or a designee.
D. City Council Meeting – Time Fixed. 
    1. Petition Method. If the petition for street vacation is signed by the owners of more than two-thirds of the property abutting upon the part of the street sought to be vacated, the city council by resolution shall fix a time when the petition shall be heard by the council. The date shall not be more than 60 days nor less than 20 days after the date of the passage of such resolution.
    2. Resolution Method. In cases where street vacation is initiated by city council resolution, the resolution shall include the city council hearing date for the proposed vacation.
E. Report and Recommendation. 
    1. All requests for street vacation, whether by petition or resolution, shall be submitted to city staff for report and recommendations to the city council.
    2. In addition, all such requests for street vacation, whether by petition or resolution, shall be considered by the planning commission.
F. Public Notice. Public notice of a proposed street vacation shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in MICC 19.15.100; provided, at least 20 days prior to the city council meeting on the proposed street vacation, and at least 20 days prior to consideration by the planning commission, the city clerk shall issue written notice of the hearings which shall be:
    1. Posted in three of the most public places in the city and in a conspicuous place on a portion of the street proposed for vacation, or at a nearby location that can be viewed by the public; and
    2. Mailed to residents of property located within 300 feet of the portion of the street or alley sought to be vacated.
G. Resolution Method – Divestiture of Jurisdiction to Proceed. If 50 percent or more of the abutting property owners file written objection to the proposed vacation with the city clerk prior to the time of hearing, the city shall be prohibited from proceeding with a proposed street vacation initiated by resolution.
H. Criteria for Granting Vacation. The city council shall grant the requested vacation; provided:
    1. The applicants can demonstrate that:
        a. Granting the vacation will not conflict with the general purposes and objectives of the city’s comprehensive plan as to land use, streets, utilities, drainage, parks, trails, and open space;
        b. The street or portion thereof, is not likely to serve a useful public purpose both now and in the future, which cannot be met through use of easements for a specific purpose, or the vacation will best serve the public interest;
        c. The vacated area will not increase the number of single-family building sites or multifamily density. This may be mitigated by appropriate conditions on the vacated area per subsection K of this section;
        d. The request for vacation was not initiated to correct a condition created by an applicant in violation of city ordinance; and
        e. The vacated area cannot be used to increase commercial density. This may be mitigated by appropriate conditions on the vacated area per subsection K of this section.
    2. The city shall not vacate a street if any portion of the street abuts Lake Washington unless the following additional criteria are satisfied:
        a. The vacation is sought by the city to enable it to acquire the property for port purposes, beach or water access purposes, boat moorage or launching sites, park, public view, recreation, or educational purposes, or other public uses;
        b. The city, by resolution of the city council, declares that the street is not presently being used as a street and that the street is not suitable for any of the following purposes: Port, beach or water access, boat moorage, launching sites, park, public view, recreation, or education; or
        c. The vacation is sought to enable the city to implement a plan, adopted by resolution or ordinance, that provides comparable or improved public access to the same shoreline area to which the streets sought to be vacated abut, had the properties included in the plan not been vacated.
    3. Before adopting a resolution vacating a street under subsection (H)(2) of this section, the city shall:
        a. Compile an inventory of all rights-of-way within the city that abut the same body of water that is abutted by the street sought to be vacated;
        b. Conduct a study to determine if the street to be vacated is suitable for use by the city for any of the following purposes: Port, boat moorage, launching sites, beach or water access, park, public view, recreation, or education;
        c. Hold a public hearing on the proposed vacation in the manner required by subsection D of this section and provide public notice of the hearing as set out in subsection F of this section, where the notice shall indicate that the area is public access, it is proposed to be vacated, and that anyone objecting to the proposed vacation should attend the public hearing or send a letter to the city indicating his or her objection; and
        d. Make a finding that the street sought to be vacated is not suitable for any of the purposes listed under subsection (H)(3)(b) of this section, and that the vacation is in the public interest.
I. City Council Decision. At the conclusion of the public hearing the city council may take the following action:
    1. Pass an ordinance granting the proposed vacation either in whole or in part; or
    2. Pass a motion denying the proposed vacation; or
    3. Pass a motion of intent to vacate stating that the city council will, by ordinance, grant the vacation if the applicant meets certain conditions within a stated period of time.
J. Granting – Conditions. 
    1. If the city council decides to grant the vacation, such action shall be made by ordinance with such conditions or limitations as the city council deems necessary and proper to preserve any desired public use, benefit or interest, such as, but not limited to:
        a. Reserving within the portion of the street that is vacated easements for access, construction, repair and maintenance of public utilities; for trails; or for other public necessities; and
        b. Land use restrictions such as, but not limited to, not allowing the area of the vacated portion being used as a part of the abutting property area if the vacated area allows increases in building density or the number of single-family homes.
    2. The city council may require that the owners of property abutting upon the street, or part thereof so vacated, compensate the city in an amount which does not exceed one-half the appraised value of the area so vacated; provided, no vacation of a street abutting Lake Washington shall be effective until the fair market value has been paid for the street that is vacated. Moneys received from the vacation shall be used by the city for acquiring additional beach or water access, acquiring additional public view sites to a body of water, or acquiring additional moorage or launching sites.
K. Effective Date. 
    1. No ordinance granting a vacation in exchange for real property as set forth below shall become effective until instruments of conveyance approved by the city attorney have been accepted by the city council.
    2. Where the city council has required compensation for the street vacation, no ordinance granting such vacation shall become effective until the owners of property abutting upon the portion of the street to be vacated have compensated the city in the appropriate amount, as provided in subsection M of this section; provided, however, in the event the street or portion thereof to be vacated was acquired at public expense, compensation may be required in an amount equal to the full appraised value of the portion vacated.
    3. A certified copy of the ordinance granting vacation shall be recorded by the city clerk in the office of the King County department of records within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance.
L. Procedure for Compensation. 
    1. Upon a finding that the criteria for granting a vacation have been met, the city council may conditionally approve the vacation and direct the city manager or his/her designee to secure an appraisal of the portion or the street or alley to be vacated and an estimate of the cost of the appraisal. The applicants shall then post with the city clerk a cash deposit equal to the estimated appraisal cost to guarantee payment for the appraisal.
    2. Upon notification that the amount of required compensation for the vacation has been established, the applicants shall have 90 days to deposit that amount, together with appraisal costs with the city clerk. Credit shall be given for the appraisal cost deposit previously made. If the required compensation and appraisal costs are not made within the allocated time period, the conditional approval of the vacation shall lapse and the portion of the appraisal cost deposit not expended on the appraisal shall be returned to the applicant.
    3. Determination of appraised value shall be made by appraisal of the portion of the street to be vacated with value determination based on highest and best use. Any easement or other public rights retained by the city or dedicated to the city shall be considered in the appraisal. The appraisal cost shall be borne by the applicant and shall be added to the amount of compensation to be received by the city for the vacation.
    4. In lieu of total or partial monetary compensation, the applicant may offer to the city a grant or dedication of real property useful for street or other public purposes. The city council shall not be obligated to accept such exchange. (Ord. 08C-01 § 5; Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

19.10.005 Purpose.
Protecting, enhancing, and maintaining trees are key community values expressed in the Mercer Island comprehensive plan. The purpose of this chapter is to encourage building and site design to minimize tree removal, and to establish standards and procedures that will result in the retention of trees on Mercer Island.
The city recognizes that trees:
A. Contribute to the residential character on Mercer Island;
B. Provide a public health benefit;
C. Provide wind protection, ecological benefits to wetlands and watercourses, and aid in the stabilization of geologically hazardous areas;
D. Improve surface water quality and control and benefit Lake Washington; and
E. Reduce noise and air pollution.
The city further acknowledges that the value of protecting, enhancing, and maintaining trees should be balanced with the other community goals of:
F. Reasonable enjoyment and use of private property by the property owner; and
G. Providing delivery of reliable utility service. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.010 Tree code – Overview.
This section is intended to provide an overview of the tree regulations contained in this chapter.
A. Generally, a permit is required to remove any tree with a diameter of greater than 10 inches (see MICC 19.10.020 and 19.10.030 for details).
B. Nondevelopment Tree Removal. If the tree is being removed for reasons other than development (for example, if the tree is coming out because a property owner is landscaping their yard), then:
    1. A simple application is required. The application shows the location of trees on the property, the tree(s) to be removed, and where replanting will occur (see MICC 19.10.090(A), General Information, for details).
    2. Replacement trees are required for the tree(s) removed, typically between October 1 and April 1 following removal (see MICC 19.10.070 for details).
C. Development Tree Removal. If the tree is being removed as part of a development (for example, to allow for construction of a new home), then:
    1. A full application is required. The application provides details on the trees on site, the removed trees, and the proposed protection measures for trees that will remain (see MICC 19.10.090 for details).
    2. Retention of some trees is required. At a minimum, 30 percent of the trees will need to be retained. Trees that are exceptional, are large, and have a high likelihood for long-term survival are prioritized for retention (see MICC 19.10.060 for details).
    3. Replacement trees are required for the tree(s) removed, typically between October 1 and April 1 following removal (see MICC 19.10.070 for details). (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.020 Applicability and permit required.
A. Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all property and public rights-of-way in the city.
B. Permit Required. A permit approval is required prior to removing any tree, except for trees that are exempt pursuant to MICC 19.10.030.
    1. Permit approval to remove one or more nonhazardous trees may take the form of a tree removal permit or other construction permit approval.
    2. Permit approval to remove one or more trees that pose an imminent threat to life or property, such as tree limbs or trunks that are demonstrably cracked, leaning toward overhead utility lines or structures, or are uprooted by flooding, heavy winds or storm events, in which event the permit must be applied for within 14 days of the removal. Permit applications shall be accompanied by documentation of the imminent threat to life or property, ideally in the form of a report by a qualified arborist, but at least in the form of photographs that clearly depict the threat. Prior notice of the impending tree removal should be provided to the city.
    3. For the purposes of this section, tree removal includes the cutting or removing directly or indirectly through site grading of any tree, or root destruction that will result in a tree ultimately becoming a hazardous tree. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.030 Exemptions.
Except where undertaken within critical areas and associated buffers, or on public property, the following activities are exempt from the permitting, replacement, retention, and protection provisions of this chapter:
A. Small Tree Removal. Removal of trees with a diameter of less than 10 inches that meet the definition of small trees, except if the small tree is an exceptional tree, as defined, or was previously planted as a replacement tree.
B. Removal of species identified in the weeds of concern, noxious, or invasive weed lists established by Washington State or King County, as amended.
C. Tree Pruning. Tree pruning, as defined in MICC 19.16.010, on private property. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.040 General provisions.
A. Relationship with Other Mercer Island Codes and Ordinances. In addition to any requirements under this chapter, the removal or pruning of any tree located within a critical area, critical area buffer or the shoreline jurisdiction shall comply with the requirements of Chapter 19.07 MICC. The city arborist may require additional information in order to confirm compliance with those requirements.
B. Public Property. 
    1. A private property owner may apply for a tree permit to prune or cut trees on any city street, pursuant to MICC 19.10.100.
    2. Pruning or cutting of trees within a public park by a private property owner is prohibited.
C. Private Utility Companies. A tree permit will be issued to private utility companies to cut trees located on public or private property if necessary for public safety, removal of hazardous trees, removal of diseased or dead trees, as part of any private utility tree maintenance program approved by the city, or for construction work. Regardless of whether or not a permit is required, all cutting or pruning of trees by private utility companies shall be performed under the supervision of a certified arborist and at the sole cost and expense of the utility company. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.050 Tree removal – Not associated with a development proposal.
A. Tree removal that is not associated with a development proposal shall provide replacement trees (MICC 19.10.070), but is exempt from tree retention (MICC 19.10.060).
B. An application for tree removal that is not associated with a development proposal shall provide the application information described under MICC 19.10.090(A) – General Information.
C. This section shall not be construed as an exemption to the tree retention and replacement requirements of Chapter 19.07 MICC. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.060 Tree removal – Associated with a development proposal.
A. Single-Family Zoning Designations. 
    1. In the R-8.4, R-9.6, R-12, and R-15 zoning designations, tree retention is required for the following development proposals:
        a. An addition or remodel to an existing single-family dwelling that will result in the addition of more than 500 square feet of gross floor area on a lot with a net lot area of 6,000 square feet or more;
        b. A new single-family dwelling on a lot with a net lot area of 6,000 square feet or more;
        c. A subdivision or short subdivision.
    2. Retention Requirement. Development proposals specified under subsection (A)(1) of this section shall retain trees as follows:
        a. A minimum of 30 percent of trees with a diameter of 10 inches or greater, or that otherwise meet the definition of large tree, shall be retained over a rolling five-year period.
        b. In addition to the retention required in subsection (A)(2)(a) of this section, the development proposal shall be designed to further minimize the removal of large trees and maximize on-site tree retention as follows:
            i. Site improvements, including but not limited to new single-family homes, additions to a single-family home, appurtenances, accessory structures, utilities, and driveways, shall be designed and located to minimize tree removal during and following construction.
            ii. The following trees shall be prioritized for retention:
                (a) Exceptional trees;
                (b) Trees with a diameter of more than 24 inches;
                (c) Trees that have a greater likelihood of longevity; and
                (d) Trees that are part of a healthy grove.
            iii. Trees shall not be removed outside the area of land disturbance except where necessary to install site improvements (e.g., driveways, utilities, etc.).
            iv. Tree removal for the purposes of site landscaping should be limited to those trees that will pose a future safety hazard to existing or proposed site improvements.
        c. Provide tree replacement pursuant to MICC 19.10.070.
    3. Retention of Exceptional Trees. Development proposals specified under subsection (A)(1) of this section shall retain exceptional trees with a diameter of 24 inches or more. Exceptional trees with a diameter of 24 inches or more that are retained shall be credited towards compliance with the retention requirements of subsection (A)(2) of this section. Removal of exceptional trees with a diameter of 24 inches or more, shall be limited to the following circumstances:
        a. Retention of an exceptional tree(s) with a diameter of 24 inches or more will result in an unavoidable hazardous situation; or
        b. Retention of an exceptional tree(s) with a diameter of 24 inches or more will limit the constructable gross floor area to less than 85 percent of the maximum gross floor area allowed under Chapter 19.02 MICC; or,
        c. Retention of an exceptional tree(s) with a diameter of 24 inches or more will prevent creation of a residential lot through a subdivision or short subdivision that is otherwise allowed by this title.
    4. Calculation of Rolling Five-Year Period. For the purposes of this section, the rolling five-year period begins five years prior to the date of application for a development approval that is subject to tree retention.
    5. Compliance Required. Development proposals on lots that have removed more than 70 percent of large trees within the rolling five-year period, such that the 30 percent tree retention requirement under subsection (A)(2) of this section cannot be met, shall not receive approval unless and until compliance has been achieved. For example, a lot that has removed all of the trees in year “one” may not receive a preliminary subdivision approval in year “four.” However, the preliminary subdivision approval may be granted in year “six,” such that the rolling five-year period does not include the tree removal in year “one.”
B. Commercial or Multifamily Zoning Designations – Tree Removal.
    1. In the PI, B, C-O, PBZ, TC, MF-2, MF-2L, and MF-3 zoning designations a tree permit is required and will be granted if it meets any of the following criteria:
        a. It is necessary for public safety, removal of hazardous trees, or removal of diseased or dead trees;
        b. It is necessary to enable construction work on the property to proceed and the owner has used reasonable best efforts to design and locate any improvements and perform the construction work in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in MICC 19.10.005;
        c. It is necessary to enable any person to satisfy the terms and conditions of any covenant, condition, view easement or other easement, or other restriction encumbering the lot that was recorded on or before July 31, 2001; and subject to MICC 19.10.090(B);
        d. It is part of the city’s forest management program or regular tree maintenance program and the city is the applicant;
        e. It is desirable for the enhancement of the ecosystem or slope stability based upon professional reports in form and content acceptable to the city arborist.
    2. Design Commission Review Required in Commercial Zones. A tree permit for a development proposal, resulting in regulated improvements located in a commercial zone, that has previously received design commission approval must first be reviewed and approved by the city’s design commission prior to permit issuance by the city. (Ord. 18C-05 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.070 Tree replacement.
Trees that are cut pursuant to a tree permit shall be replaced as specified in subsections A and B of this section, or a fee in lieu shall be paid as specified in subsection C of this section.
A. Tree Replacement Ratio. Removed trees shall have the following base replacement ratio:
+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
|        Diameter of removed tree         | Number of replacement trees required |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Less than 10 inches                     | 1                                    |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 10 inches up to 24 inches               | 2                                    |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| 24 inches up to 36 inches               | 3                                    |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| More than 36 inches and any exceptional | 6                                    |
| tree(s)                                 |                                      |
+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
B. Replacement Trees.
    1. Location. Replacement trees shall be located in the following order of priority from most important to least important:
        a. On-site replacement adjacent to or within critical tree areas as defined in Chapter 19.16 MICC;
        b. On-site replacement outside of critical tree areas adjacent to other retained trees making up a grove or stand of trees;
        c. On-site replacement outside of critical tree areas; and
        d. Off-site in adjacent public right-of-way where explicitly authorized by the city.
    2. Species. Replacement trees shall primarily be those species native to the Pacific Northwest. In making a determination regarding the species of replacement trees, the city arborist shall defer to the species selected by the property owner unless the city arborist determines that the species selected is unlikely to survive for a period of at least 10 years, represents a danger or nuisance, would threaten overhead or underground utilities or would fail to provide adequate protection to any critical tree area.
    3. Size. 
        a. Coniferous trees shall be at least six feet tall; and
        b. Deciduous trees shall be at least one and one-half inches in caliper.
    The city arborist may authorize the planting of smaller-sized replacement trees if the applicant can demonstrate that smaller trees are more suited to the species, the site conditions, neighborhood character, and the purposes of this section, and that such replacement trees will be planted in sufficient quantities to meet the intent of this section. The city arborist shall not authorize the planting of shrubs or bushes in lieu of required replacement trees.
    4. Reduction. The city arborist may reduce the number of replacement trees as follows, where other measures designed to mitigate the tree loss by restoring the tree canopy coverage and its associated benefits are considered to be effective and consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The city arborist may consider, but is not limited to, the following measures:
        a. Replacement of hazardous, undesired, or short-lived trees with healthy new trees that have a greater chance of long-term survival;
        b. Restoration of critical tree areas with native vegetation; and
        c. Protection of small trees to provide for successional stages of tree canopy.
    5. Timing. Replacement trees shall be planted in the wet season (October 1 through April 1), following the applicable tree removal or, in the case of a development proposal, completion of the development work, provided the city arborist may authorize an extension to ensure optimal planting conditions for tree survival.
C. Fee-in-Lieu. If the city arborist determines there is insufficient area to replant on the site or within the adjacent public right-of-way, the city arborist may authorize payment of a fee-in-lieu provided:
    1. There is insufficient area on the lot or adjacent right-of-way for proposed on-site tree replacement to meet the tree replacement requirements of this chapter; or
    2. Tree replacement or management provided within public right-of-way or a city park in the vicinity will be of greater benefit to the community.
    3. Fees provided in lieu of on-site tree replacement shall be determined based upon:
        a. The expected tree replacement cost including labor, materials, and maintenance for each replacement tree; and
        b. The most current Council of Tree and Landscaper Appraisers Guide for Plant Appraisal.
    4. Any fee-in-lieu is also optional for the applicant and requires an explicit written agreement.
D. Maintenance of Replacement Trees. The applicant shall maintain all replacement trees in a healthy condition for a period of five years after planting. The applicant shall be obligated to replant any replacement tree that dies, becomes diseased, or is removed during this five-year time period.
E. Private Utility Company. If the permit is granted to a private utility company and the property owner is unwilling to place any replacement trees on the owner’s property, the private utility company shall pay to the city the amount necessary to purchase and plant replacement trees on public property necessary to mitigate the impact of the removed trees based upon arborist industry standards. Monies paid to the city for replacement trees shall be used for that purpose. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.080 Tree protection standards.
A. To ensure long-term viability of trees identified for protection, permit plans and construction activities shall comply with the then-existing Best Management Practices (BMP) – Managing Trees During Construction, published by the International Society of Arboriculture, adopted by reference. The tree protection plan shall be prepared by a qualified arborist and the plan shall be reviewed for adequacy by the city arborist. All minimum required tree protection measures shall be shown on the development plan set and tree replanting/restoration/protection plan.
B. Alternative Methods. The city arborist may approve construction-related activity or work within the tree protection barriers if the city arborist concludes:
    1. That such activity or work will not threaten the long-term health of the retained tree(s); and
    2. That such activity or work complies with the protective methods and best building practices established by the International Society of Arboriculture. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

D. Peer Review and Conflict of Interest. 
    1. The city may require peer review of the tree permit application by a qualified arborist to verify the adequacy of the information and analysis. The applicant shall bear the cost of the peer review.
    2. The code official may require the applicant to retain a replacement qualified arborist or may require a peer review where the code official believes a conflict of interest exists. For example, if an otherwise qualified arborist is employed by a tree removal company and prepares the arborist report for a development proposal, a replacement qualified arborist or a peer review may be required. (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.10.100 Trees on public property.
An application for a tree permit to cut a tree on public property or a request to have the city prune a public tree located on a city street shall be reviewed by the city arborist based upon the following conditions and criteria:
A. By the City. An annual tree permit will be issued to the city to cut any public trees necessary for public safety, removal of hazardous trees, removal of diseased or dead trees, as part of the city’s forest management program or regular tree maintenance program or for construction work on public property.
B. By Private Property Owners in City Street. A private property owner may apply for a tree permit to cut or prune a public tree located on any city street if the owner demonstrates in the following order that all of the criteria are satisfied:
    1. The owner establishes that the tree is located on a city street;
    2. The city arborist determines that the proposed pruning or cutting can be performed without adversely affecting any critical tree areas;
    3. Tree Cutting. The city arborist determines that proposed tree removal is:
        a. Necessary for access to private property;
        b. Necessary for installation of required public improvements (e.g., sidewalk, public utilities, etc.);
    4. Tree Pruning. The city arborist determines that proposed tree pruning is:
        a. Required to resolve a possible hazard to public or private health or safety; or
        b. Requested by a valid petition executed by at least 60 percent of the property owners located within a 300-foot radius of the subject tree in favor of the proposed pruning of the tree; and
    5. Additional information prepared by a qualified arborist, if required by the city arborist, is provided to ensure the long-term health and viability of trees that will remain following pruning or removal;
    6. In the case of tree cutting, the private property owner provides tree replacement consistent with MICC 19.10.070;
    7. The owner pays a fee to cover all costs associated with reviewing the pruning or cutting request;
    8. The pruning or cutting is performed at the sole cost and expense of the private property owner; and
    9. Tree topping is prohibited.

19.11.010 General.
A. Applicability. This chapter establishes development and design standards for the Mercer Island Town Center (TC) zone, the location and boundaries of which are set forth in MICC 19.01.040 and Appendix D, the Mercer Island Zoning Map. The general purpose of this chapter is to implement the land use policies of the Mercer Island comprehensive plan for the area referred to as the Town Center. The development and design standards are not intended to slow or restrict development, but rather to add consistency and predictability to the permit review process.
B. User Guide. The Town Center is divided into subareas mostly for the purpose of regulating maximum height limits. A two-story height limit applies throughout the Town Center. Only by providing certain benefits to the community can a development project add additional stories up to the maximum height allowed in the particular subarea. These community benefits include affordable housing; green building features; stepping back of upper stories to reduce building mass and maintain light and air; provision of public open spaces as gathering places; and provision of through-block pedestrian connections to break up larger blocks and enhance pedestrian access.
C. Town Center Vision. The Town Center Vision found in the Mercer Island comprehensive plan is adopted herein by reference.
D. Design Vision. 
    1. Development and Design Standards. The development and design standards that follow are intended to enhance the Town Center for pedestrians and develop a sense of place. To accomplish this vision, new or redevelopment is encouraged to orient buildings toward the public right-of-way with buildings brought forward to the sidewalk or landscaped edge; parking placed behind buildings and in less visible areas or underground; design structures with varied mass and scale, modulation of heights and wall planes; and pedestrian through-block connections that will break up very large or long blocks for improved pedestrian circulation from one side of the block through to the other side.
    2. Function. The design of buildings, structures and streetscapes within the Town Center is intended to support a built environment that is convenient and accessible to pedestrians, motorists, bicyclists and public transit users. Development should enhance the Town Center as a vibrant, healthy, mixed use downtown that serves as the city’s retail, business, social, cultural and entertainment center and ensures the commercial and economic vitality of the area. New or redevelopment should increase the attractions and pedestrian amenities that bring residents to the Town Center, including local shopping, services, offices, specialty retail, restaurants, residences, festivals, special events, and entertainment. Outdoor spaces should function as social settings for a variety of experiences, adding to the comfort of life in Mercer Island, while maintaining a human scale and an ability for easy pedestrian circulation.
    3. Site Features. New or redevelopment should include public amenities, such as storefronts with canopies, street trees, greenery, seating, fountains or water features, outdoor cafes, sculpture or other forms of art, and places for gathering and lingering. The use of materials, color, texture, form and massing, proportion, public amenities, mitigation of environmental impacts, landscaping and vegetation, and architectural detail should be incorporated in the design of new or redevelopment with the purpose of supporting a human scale, pedestrian-oriented Town Center. New or redevelopment shall be coordinated and consistent with the downtown street standards.
    4. Pedestrian Orientation. Pedestrian-oriented and customer intensive retail businesses and offices are encouraged to locate on the street level to promote active use of sidewalks by pedestrians, thus increasing the activity level and economic viability of the Town Center. New or redevelopment should also enhance and support a range of transportation choices and be designed to maximize opportunities for alternative modes of transportation and maintain individual mobility. Even with a healthy variety of development in the Town Center, each individual development or redevelopment project shall favor the pedestrian over the automobile in terms of site design, building placement and parking locations.
E. Scale. The design of all structures shall consider how the structure and site development will be viewed from the street and adjacent properties. Scale is not simply the size of the buildings, it is the proportion of buildings in relationship to each other, to the street and to the pedestrian environment.
F. Form. Building forms shall not present visual mass impacts that are out of proportion to the adjoining structures, or that appear from the street or sidewalk as having unmodulated visual mass. Building additions should complement the original structure in design.
G. Style. The objectives and standards do not set or encourage a particular style of architecture or design theme. However, building and site design shall be pedestrian in scale and address design features such as sloped roof lines; distinctive building shapes; integration of art, textures, and patterns; treatment of pedestrian and public spaces; interface with the public right-of-way; landscaping; signage and facade treatments. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.015 Town Center subareas.
A. Intent. The primary intent of establishing subareas within the Town Center is to provide differing building height standards and land uses within the Town Center. Buildings within the Town Center are limited to two stories in height unless community benefits are provided as discussed throughout this chapter. The purpose of the different height standards is to locate taller buildings on the north end of the Town Center, and step down building height through the center to the south end of Town Center, bordering Mercerdale Park.
B. Subareas Established. The following subareas have been established and are depicted on Figure 1 below.
    1. TC-5 Subarea. The purpose of the TC-5 subarea is to create a focused mixed use core, oriented toward pedestrian connections and regional transit access. A broad mix of land uses is allowed. Buildings may be up to five stories in height.
    2. TC-4 Subarea. The purpose of the TC-4 subarea is to be a transition between the taller buildings in the TC-5 subarea and the lower structures in the TC-3 and TCMF-3 subareas. A broad mix of land uses is allowed. Buildings may be up to four stories in height.
    3. TC-4 Plus Subarea. The purpose of the TC-4 Plus subarea is to be a transition between the taller buildings in the TC-5 subarea and the TC-4 subarea. A broad mix of land uses is allowed. Buildings may be up to five stories in height with the provision of additional public open space.
    4. TC-3 Subarea. The purpose of the TC-3 subarea is to create an area of transition between the Town Center and adjacent residential neighborhoods. A broad mix of land uses is allowed. Buildings may be up to three stories in height.
    5. TCMF-4 (Multifamily Residential) Subarea. The purpose of the TCMF-4 subarea is to provide for primarily multifamily residential housing of up to four stories. Street-oriented housing, live/work units and limited retail uses are allowed at the street level.
    6. TCMF-3 (Multifamily Residential) Subarea. The purpose of the TCMF-3 subarea is to provide for primarily multifamily residential housing of up to three stories. Street-oriented housing, live/work units and limited retail uses are allowed at the street level.Figure 1 – Town Center Subareas and Maximum Height Limit

    2. North American Industry Classification System. Questions as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular use shall be determined by the code official based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) – United States, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
B. Required Ground Floor Uses. Retail, restaurant or personal service uses are required along retail street frontages as shown on Figure 2.
    1. If public parking is provided pursuant to MICC 19.11.130(B)(5), then the following applies:
        a. A minimum of 40 percent of the ground floor street frontage shall be occupied by one or more of the following permitted uses: retail, restaurant, and/or personal service use.
        b. A maximum of 60 percent of each ground floor street frontage can be occupied by the following uses: hotel/motel, personal service, public facility, or office.
        c. Driveways, service and truck loading areas, parking garage entrances and lobbies shall not be included in calculating the required percentages of ground floor use.
    2. If public parking is not provided pursuant to MICC 19.11.130(B)(5), then the following applies:
        a. A minimum of 60 percent of the ground floor street frontage shall be occupied by one or more of the following permitted uses: retail, restaurant, and/or personal service use.
        b. A maximum of 40 percent of each ground floor street frontage can be occupied by the following uses: hotel/motel, personal service, public facility, or office.
        c. Driveways, service and truck loading areas, parking garage entrances and lobbies shall not be included in calculating the required percentages of ground floor use.
    3. No use shall occupy a continuous linear street frontage exceeding 60 feet in length. The design commission may approve up to an additional six feet in length if the use incorporates a feature to promote pedestrian activity, including but not limited to: an additional pedestrian entrance onto a sidewalk or through-block connection, or additional 10 percent transparency beyond the requirement of MICC 19.11.100(B)(1)(b).
    4. The minimum required depth of storefronts along retail street frontages is 16 feet.Figure 2 – Retail Use Required Adjacent To Street Frontages
    [IMAGE: <19.11.020_001.jpg>]
C. Reducing continuous retail frontages through the use of smaller retail spaces is intended to encourage pedestrian friendly retail, ensure that the retail spaces are appropriately sized for small retail operators, and limit large (“box store”) development. Figure 3 provides an example of how a building floor can be designed. Smaller retail spaces are provided along a street and larger nonretail space is provided in the back of the floor.Figure 3 – Retail Frontage Standards
[IMAGE: <19.11.020_002.jpg>]
D. Accessory Uses. 
    1. Outdoor Storage and Display of Merchandise. The total area allowed for outdoor storage and/or merchandise display shall be less than five percent of the total gross square footage of the use; provided, however, that such area may exceed five percent if it is fenced, screened, and located in a manner that is acceptable to the design commission. This standard does not apply to temporary uses such as material storage during construction or street vendors.
    2. Commerce on Public Property. Commerce on public property may be allowed pursuant to MICC 19.06.050.
    3. Transit Facilities. Bus parking/loading space, and shelters and facilities for transit users should be integrated in the design of major new construction. Plans should be coordinated with transit providers to maximize the interface with community-wide and regional transit systems.
    4. Bicycle Facilities. Parking and facilities that support bicycle use, including racks, covered and secured bike-storage areas, and in the case of office buildings, lockers and showers, should be included in the design of major new construction.
    5. Utility and Equipment Cabinets. Existing or proposed utility and equipment cabinets or boxes, including wireless communication facilities, shall be placed inside a building or placed underground, if physically feasible. In the event the city determines such location is not physically feasible, the utility and equipment cabinets must be screened by fencing, landscaping and/or stealth screening technologies so that they are not visible.
E. Objectionable or Hazardous Uses. No use shall be allowed which produces excessive odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, fumes, noise, vibration, refuse matter or water-carried waste. The standard for “excessive” shall be based on the average or normal production of these items by adjoining uses permitted in the vicinity of the proposed new use. A use is excessive if it is likely to unreasonably interfere with the ability of the adjoining property owners to utilize their property for working or living activities or if it is likely to unreasonably interfere with the ability of pedestrians and residents to remain in or enjoy the area. (Ord. 18C-14 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

    +----------------------------+-----------+---------------+----------+---------+---------+
    2. Base Building Height. A base building height of up to two stories (not to exceed 27 feet) shall be allowed. One-story structures located adjacent to the public right-of-way in the TC-5, TC-4, TC-4 Plus and TC-3 subareas shall be a minimum of 15 feet and may be as tall as 27 feet with approval of the design commission to ensure the taller facade provides features that ensure a pedestrian scale.
    3. Calculation of Building Height.
        a. The intent of the building height calculation in this section is to limit the visual mass of a building so that it does not appear to exceed the maximum height limit in subsection (A)(1) of this section.
        b. The maximum allowable building height in subsection (A)(1) of this section shall be calculated as the vertical distance measured from the base of a building facade to the highest point of the roof structure excluding appurtenances. The base of the building facade shall be measured from the adjacent public sidewalk if applicable, or from the lower of existing or finished grade along building facades that are not adjacent to a public sidewalk. See Figure 4.
        c. If the bases of the opposite building facades are at approximately the same elevation, then the building height at any point between the facades can never exceed the maximum permitted building height. If the bases of the opposite building facades are not at approximately the same elevation, then the building must be configured to go down in height as between the higher and lower facades in a manner similar to Figure 4 or in an equivalent manner such that the average of the building heights calculated between the facades is approximately equal to or less than the maximum permitted building height.Figure 4 – Maximum Building Height
        [IMAGE: <19.11.030_001.jpg>]
    4. Mezzanines. A mezzanine shall not be counted as a story for determining the allowable number of stories when constructed in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes set forth in MICC Title 17.
    5. Rooftop Appurtenances. Rooftop appurtenances are discouraged. If necessary, rooftop appurtenances may extend up to 10 feet above the maximum building height allowed, provided there is a functional need for the appurtenance and that functional need cannot be met with an appurtenance of a lesser height. This provision shall not be construed to allow building height in excess of the maximum limit. Rooftop appurtenances should be located at least 10 feet from the exterior edge of any building, and together with the screening provided for below, shall not cover more than 20 percent of the rooftop area.
        a. Screening of Rooftop Appurtenances. Appurtenances shall not be located on the roof of a structure unless they are hidden or camouflaged by building elements that were designed for that purpose as an integral part of the building design. All appurtenances located on the roof should be grouped together and incorporated into the roof design and thoroughly screened. The screening should be sight-obscuring, located at least 10 feet from the exterior edge of any building; and effective in obscuring the view of the appurtenances from public streets or sidewalks or residential areas located on the hillside surrounding the Town Center.
        b. Wireless Communication Facilities. Wireless communication facilities (WCFs) shall be governed by MICC 19.06.040; provided, they shall be screened as required by subsection (A)(5)(a) of this section.
    6. Setbacks. 
        a. 78th Avenue SE. All structures shall be set back so that space is provided for at least 15 feet of sidewalk between the structure and the face of the street curb, excluding locations where the curbline is interrupted by parking pockets. Additional setbacks are encouraged to provide space for more pedestrian-oriented activities and to accommodate street trees and parking pockets.
        b. All Other Public Rights-of-Way. All structures shall be set back so that space is provided for at least 12 feet of sidewalk between the structure and the face of the street curb, excluding locations where the curbline is interrupted by parking pockets. Additional setbacks along SE 32nd Street are encouraged to provide space for more pedestrian-oriented activities and to accommodate street trees and parking pockets.
    7. Average Daylight Plane.
        a. Block frontages along streets must integrate average minimum upper level building stepbacks to:
            i. Reduce the perceived scale of building facades along streets;
            ii. Increase the amount of light and air to adjacent streets;
            iii. Promote modulation of building facades along streets that adds variety and provides visual interest;
            iv. Encourage the integration of courtyards and open space along block frontages; and
            v. Allow for flexibility in the design of block frontages along streets.
        b. The average minimum upper level building stepbacks shall comply with the following:
            i. From a height of 25 feet at the front property line, buildings shall step back at a 45-degree angle up to the maximum height limit.
            ii. Calculations for determining compliance with the average daylight plane standards shall utilize cubic volume (cubic feet) and shall consider only the first 30 feet of depth along block frontages.
            iii. Only the development site’s applicable block frontage may be used to determine compliance with the provisions herein.
            iv. Since the daylight plane standards above apply a minimum average, portions of block frontages may project beyond the daylight plane concept described in subsection (A)(7)(a) of this section, provided the applicable block frontage as a whole complies with the minimum average. Figure 5 illustrates the concept.
            v. For each cubic foot that part of a building protrudes beyond the daylight plane (“debit”), the project must include an equivalent cubic footage of open space (“credit”) either on the ground floor adjacent to the street (such as a public open space, courtyard or through-block connection), and/or by setting portions of the building facade farther back beneath the daylight plane. For the purposes of this section, the cubic feet of a portion of a building is measured from floor to the top of the roof, and along the outside of exterior walls. The cubic feet of open or credit volume is measured from finished ground level or top of roof to an imaginary line representing the daylight plane as defined in subsection (A)(7)(b)(i) of this section. The intent is that the required open space or credit volume be open to the sky; however, the design commission has discretion to allow eaves, pedestrian weather protection and landscaping within the required open space as long as the objectives in subsection (A)(7)(a) of this section are met.
            vi. Daylight plane debits and credits shall be applied on the same block frontage and cannot be transferred to other block frontages.
            Figure 5 – Illustrating the Average Daylight Plane Standards
            [IMAGE: <19.11.030_002.jpg>]
The average daylight plane extends vertically from the applicable property line 25 feet and then steps back at a 45-degree angle to help reduce the massing of buildings fronting streets.
[IMAGE: <19.11.030_003.jpg>]
[IMAGE: <19.11.030_004.jpg>]
The amount of credit volume shall exceed the debit volume to comply with the “average.”
Figure 6 – An Example Development Massing Model with Block Frontages That Comply with the Average Daylight Plane Standards
Figure 6 illustrates how a development with multiple block frontages and a through-block connection could meet the average daylight plane standards. The image focuses on the foreground block frontage and illustrates that the block frontage features a combination of debit and credit volume (individual facades that project into average daylight plane are “debit” volume whereas facades that exceed the setback/stepbacks of the average daylight plane are “credit” volume.)

(Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.040 Affordable housing.
A. Purpose and Intent. The incentives and regulations offered in this section are used by the city as one means of meeting its commitment to encourage housing affordable to all economic groups, and to meet its regional share of affordable housing requirements. The purpose of this section is to: (1) implement through regulations the responsibility of the city under state law to provide for housing opportunities for all economic segments of the community, (2) help address the shortage of housing in the city for persons of moderate-income households, (3) promote development of affordable housing that would not otherwise be built in the city, and (4) offer incentives to encourage construction of affordable housing units in Town Center.
B. Affordable Housing Ratio. In order to qualify as significant affordable housing and in order to qualify for bonus building height over two stories, a development that contains dwelling units must provide affordable housing units equal to at least 10 percent of the total units in the development. The number of required affordable units shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.
C. Affordability Level. For a three-story building the required affordable housing units must be affordable at the 70 percent of median income level for rental housing or 90 percent of median income level for ownership housing. For four- and five-story buildings, the required affordable housing units must be affordable at the 60 percent of median income level for rental housing or 90 percent of median income level for ownership housing.
D. Design Elements. 
    1. The affordable housing units shall generally be intermingled with all other dwelling units in the development and are not required to be located on the top story or bonus story.
    2. The tenure (owner- or renter-occupied) of the affordable housing units shall be the same as the tenure of the rest of the dwelling units in the development.
    3. The affordable housing units shall consist of a mix of the unit types (by number of bedrooms) that is generally proportionate to the mix of units in the overall development.
    4. Affordable units may not be smaller than other units with the same number of bedrooms in the development, unless the code official determines that rooms within the affordable units provide adequate space for their intended use. In no case shall the affordable units be more than 10 percent smaller than the market-rate units having the same number of bedrooms in the development, or less than 500 square feet if a studio unit, 600 square feet if a one-bedroom unit, 800 square feet if a two-bedroom unit, 1,000 square feet if a three-bedroom unit, or 1,200 square feet if a four-bedroom unit; whichever is less.
    5. The exteriors of the affordable housing units must be compatible with and comparable in quality to the rest of the dwelling units in the development and shall comply with any design standards for the underlying zoning district. The interior finish of the affordable units shall, at a minimum, be comparable to entry level rental or ownership housing in the development.
E. Availability. The affordable housing units shall be available for occupancy in a time frame comparable to the availability of the rest of the dwelling units in the development.
F. Agreement. Prior to issuance of a building permit, an agreement in form and substance acceptable to the city attorney shall be executed providing price restrictions, homebuyer or tenant qualifications and long-term affordability. The agreement shall be recorded with King County department of records and elections and shall constitute a covenant running with the land. Affordable housing units shall remain as affordable housing for a minimum of 50 years from the date of initial owner occupancy for owner affordable units and for the life of the project for rental affordable housing units. At the sole discretion of the code official, the city may approve a shorter affordability time period for owner-occupied affordable housing, not to be less than 30 years, in order to meet federal financial underwriting guidelines.
    1. The agreement shall provide the city sole discretion to establish monitoring fees for the affordable units, which fees may be adjusted over time to account for inflation. The purpose of any monitoring fee is for the review and processing of documents to maintain compliance with income and affordability restrictions of the affordability agreement.
    2. The city may agree, at its sole discretion, to subordinate any affordable housing regulatory agreement for affordable ownership units for the purpose of enabling the owner to obtain financing for development of the property.
G. Impact Fees. Affordable housing may be exempt from impact fees pursuant to MICC 19.17.090 (schools), 19.18.070 (parks) and 19.19.070 (transportation). (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.050 Green building standards.
Any major new construction shall meet the LEED Gold standard. Projects that are primarily residential (at least 50 percent of the gross floor area is composed of residential uses) may instead meet the Built Green 4 Star standard. The applicant shall provide proof of LEED or Built Green certification within 180 days of issuance of a final certificate of occupancy, or such later date as may be allowed by the code official for good cause, by submitting a report analyzing the extent credits were earned toward such rating. Failure to submit a timely report regarding LEED or Built Green ratings by the date required is a violation of this code. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.060 Site design.
A. Minor Site Features. All major new construction regardless of its height shall have at least three minor site features that contribute to a well-balanced mix of features in that subarea as determined by the design commission. Minor site features may include, but are not limited to, the following:
    1. Decorative Landmarks. Imaginative features that complement the building design and create visual focal points that give identity to an area, such as decorative clocks, special paving in pedestrian areas, art features, water features, drinking fountains, or creative designs for necessary building features or functions. Art should be integrated with the public street improvements. Examples include sculpture, murals, inlays, mosaics, friezes or bas-reliefs. The location of art shall provide for public view but not hinder pedestrian traffic.
    2. Kiosks. Community-oriented kiosks, which may include bulletin boards and newsstands or racks, creatively designed and consolidated and placed in areas where large numbers of people gather, and which complement the site design and streetscape and reduces visual clutter.
    3. Additional Sidewalk Setback. At least five feet of sidewalk width, in addition to the minimum sidewalk setback provided for in MICC 19.11.030(A)(6), may be provided along 78th Avenue SE, along the entire street frontage of the development site. Such additional sidewalk should be designed to provide additional pedestrian access where parking pockets narrow the sidewalk, to accommodate street trees and benches, or to create spaces for more pedestrian-oriented activities such as outdoor dining or seating.
    4. Impact on Public Open Spaces. Minor site features may not occupy space in a public open space to the extent that doing so reduces the actual space that is usable by the public below the minimum required area.
B. Major Site Features. Any major new construction in the TC-5, TC-4, TC-4 Plus or TC-3 subarea which exceeds the two-story base height and that includes or abuts a preferred through-block connection location shown on Figure 7 shall include a through-block connection subject to design commission determination that such connection is feasible and achievable. Any major new construction exceeding three stories in height in the TC-5, TC-4 or TC-4 Plus subarea shall include at least one of the following major site features, subject to design commission determination that such choices contribute to a well-balanced mix of features in that subarea:
    1. Through-Block Connection. Through-block pedestrian connections will qualify as a major site feature upon satisfaction of the development and design standards set forth in subsection E of this section. If the on-site area of the through-block connection does not equal or exceed three percent of the gross floor area of the development, then public open space shall also be provided so that the total area of the through-block connection and public open space equals or exceeds three percent of the gross floor area of the development.
    2. Public Open Space. Public open spaces will qualify as a major site feature upon satisfaction of the development and design standards set forth in subsection D of this section.
C. Other Site Features. The design commission may approve other major or minor site features in place of those listed above consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
    1. Major Site Features. Site features other than listed in subsection B of this section will only be considered as a major site feature if it is of equal or greater public benefit than one or more of the major site features listed in subsection B of this section. Underground or structured parking that supports park and ride use may be considered a major site feature. The amount of park and ride parking qualifying as a major site feature shall be determined by the design commission.
    2. Minor Site Features. Examples of other minor site features include contribution to a public art or design project within close proximity to the new construction, such as the city’s I-90 Artway; and/or transit-oriented development (TOD) amenities, such as facilities that support bicycle use.
D. Public Open Space. Refers to plazas, parks or other spaces intended for the use and enjoyment of the public in the Town Center zone. Public open spaces serve as public gathering spaces and, depending on their size, could accommodate a variety of public events, as well as provide space for informal gatherings and quiet activities.
    1. Size. A single public open space shall be a minimum size equal to three percent of the gross floor area of the development and shall be at least 20 feet in width. For a fifth floor in the TC-4 Plus subarea, public open space shall increase to a minimum of seven and one-half percent of the gross floor area of the development. The design commission may allow a development to provide two or more public open spaces so long as the design commission determines that such multiple public open spaces will have an equal or greater public benefit and each is at least 1,500 square feet in area. The primary purpose of the public open spaces shall be as public gathering places. Other uses of public open spaces whose primary purpose is not for public gathering including but not limited to lobby entrances, stairs, and cordoned off/private outdoor restaurant seating shall not be included in calculating the minimum size of the public open spaces. Such areas shall be in addition to any area required as a minor site feature under subsection A of this section. If a development is required to provide both a public open space and a through-block connection, then the area of the through-block connection that meets the requirements of subsection E of this section shall also be counted towards the public open space requirement.
    2. Design Elements. 
        a. Public open spaces shall be at the same level as the public sidewalk, serve as a focal point for pedestrian activity within the Town Center zone, and should be fully integrated and designed consistent with any pedestrian connection or other public amenity.
        b. Public open spaces shall be designed with sufficient pedestrian amenities including seating, lighting, water features, special paving, landscaping, artwork and special recreational features, as determined by the design commission. At least two linear feet of seating surfaces per 100 square feet of space should be provided. To qualify, seating surfaces shall be a minimum of 18 inches in depth. At least half the seating should have seat backs and have surfaces made of wood, rather than metal, stone or concrete. In addition, moveable chairs may be provided and shall not be for the sole use of an adjacent retail business.
        c. Pedestrian-oriented frontage is required on at least two sides unless the space is linear in design, in which case pedestrian-oriented frontage is required on at least one side.
        d. At least 25 percent but not more than 60 percent of an outdoor public open space should be landscaped with shade trees, ground cover or other vegetation.
        e. The public open space may not be covered by a roof, story or skybridge; provided portions of the public open space may be covered for weather protection, or be enclosed pursuant to subsection (D)(2)(f) of this section.
        f. Enclosed and/or covered public open space may be approved by the design commission; provided, that the space is available for public use.
        g. All city approvals or permits for any structure shall be reviewed for compatibility with the alignment of any existing or approved public open space.
    3. Public Open Space Plan. The applicant shall submit a plan with a minimum scale of one-quarter inch equals one foot for the public open space which shall include a description of all landscaping; lighting; street furniture; color and materials; relationship to building frontage; specific location of the public open space; and the relationship to and coordination with any pedestrian connection or other public amenity.
    4. Public Access. The entire public open space should be open to the public 24 hours per day. Temporary closures will be allowed as necessary for maintenance purposes. Upon city approval, portions of the public open space may be separated, as required by the State of Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board or its successor agency, in order to allow outdoor seating for restaurant purposes.
E. Through-Block Pedestrian Connections. Through-block pedestrian connections are intended to provide convenient and safe public pedestrian routes through city blocks.
    1. Location. Connections shall be located on the lots eligible for through-block pedestrian connections as shown on Figure 7 and in other locations based on the following criteria. The actual location of the pedestrian connection on the lot shall be determined by the design commission based upon the following criteria: (a) the connection will connect with existing or future rights-of-way, other pedestrian connections and/or public open spaces; (b) the connection has the effect of dividing a large city block approximately in the middle of such block in approximately the preferred locations shown on Figure 7; and (c) it is likely that the remainder of the subject connection will be developed in the future based upon development conditions on surrounding lots.Figure 7 – Preferred Through-Block Pedestrian Connection Locations>
    [IMAGE: <19.11.060_001.jpg>]
    2. Design Elements. 
        a. The connection shall be the length necessary to provide access between existing rights-of-way; provided, however, that if an applicant does not own all property necessary to make the connection, this option will still be available if an easement is provided to the city for the remainder of the connection. If the applicant cannot obtain the easement after using best efforts, the city may still approve the connection. The connection shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide unless the design commission approves a lesser width because the applicant provides other site features of equal or greater public benefit as determined by the design commission. The area devoted to a connection shall be in addition to the area devoted to any other minor site feature required pursuant to subsection A of this section. The primary purposes of the connection shall be as a means for pedestrian access between rights-of-way and secondarily as a public gathering place. Other uses, including pedestrian access to parking areas, lobby entrances, and stairs, must be secondary to and not conflict with the connection purpose and areas required for such uses shall not be included in calculating the minimum size.
        b. The connection shall be at the same level as the public sidewalk and incorporate sufficient pedestrian amenities such as seating areas, landscaping, art features, water features, weather protection and pedestrian scale lighting, as determined by the design commission.
        c. The connection should use special paving, such as decorative colored concrete, concrete unit brick or stone pavers and coordinated design features such as uniform treatment of signing, landscaping and lighting over the entire length of the connection. Pervious paving is encouraged.
        d. At least 50 percent of the ground level building frontage shall be designed and constructed to provide occupancy by active residential or nonresidential uses.
        e. Where ground level residential uses front onto the through-block connection the building must feature at least one of the public/private space transition elements described below:
            i. Raised Deck or Porch Option. Provide at least a 60-square-foot porch or deck raised at least one foot above grade. The porch or deck must be at least six feet wide, measured perpendicular to the building face. A low fence, rail or planting, which is two feet to four feet high, is encouraged between the through-block connection and the deck or porch. A porch roof or weather protection is encouraged. The design should consider accessibility.
            ii. Private Open Space Option. Provide a private open space at least 10 feet wide between the face of the residence and the edge of the through-block connection. The space may be paved or landscaped. A low fence, rail or planting which is two to four feet high shall be provided between the through-block connection and the open space.
            iii. Landscaped Area. Provide a landscaped area at least 10 feet wide between the face of the building and the edge of the through-block connection. The plantings must reach three feet high within three years after planting.
            iv. Raised Ground Floor. If the residence’s ground floor is at least three feet above the grade adjacent to the building, then the landscaped area in option (iii), above, may be reduced to four feet wide.
            v. Other transition design measures that adequately protect the privacy and comfort of the residential unit and the attractiveness and usefulness of the pathway at least as effectively as options (i) through (iv) above, as determined by the design commission.
            Figure 8 – Acceptable Public/Private Transitional Space Design between Through-Block Connections and Ground Level Residential Units
    The upper left image uses a low fence and landscaped setback. The right images use landscaped terraces and elevated ground level units. The lower left image uses a landscaped berm between the pathway and semi-private open space.
    [IMAGE: <19.11.060_002.jpg>]
        f. Where ground level nonresidential uses front onto the through-block connection the building must feature:
            i. Transparent windows along 50 percent of the ground floor facade between 30 inches and 10 feet above the through-block connection.
            ii. Entrances facing the through-block connection are required for each tenant adjacent to the through-block connection.
        g. No more than 50 percent of through-block connection ground level frontages may be occupied by vehicle parking areas. Where surface level parking areas are adjacent to the through-block connections, landscaping and building design features shall be included to add visual interest and screen vehicles while designing for safety of pedestrians along the connection.
        h. The through-block connection may not be covered by a roof or story; provided portions of the public open space may be covered for weather protection, but not enclosed, and skybridges connecting two buildings are allowed if the skybridge is less than 20 feet wide and less than 14 feet in height.
        i. All city approvals or permits for any structure shall be reviewed for compatibility with the alignment of any existing or approved through-block connection.
        j. The connection shall be for exclusive pedestrian use and may not be used by vehicles except as necessary for maintenance or emergency purposes. Dumpsters and other service areas shall not be located within a through-block connection, but may be totally enclosed within a building adjacent to the through-block connection.
        k. The design commission may approve a connection that is not in a straight line.Figure 9 – Examples of Acceptable Through-Block Connections
    The upper left image features trees on both sides of the connection and outdoor dining area with adjacent restaurants. The upper right image features retail shops fronting onto a corridor. The lower left image features a double pathway with central lawn and adjacent townhouses. The right image features adjacent apartments with a landscaped buffer.
    [IMAGE: <19.11.060_003.jpg>]
    3. Connection Plan. The applicant shall submit a plan with a minimum scale of one-quarter inch equals one foot for the connection, which shall include a description of all of the following elements: landscaping; lighting; street furniture; color and materials; relationship to building frontage; specific location of the connection and the relationship to and coordination with any public open space.
    4. Public Access. The entire connection should be open to the public 24 hours per day. Temporary closures will be allowed as necessary for maintenance purposes. Upon city approval, portions of the connection may be separated, as required by the State of Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board or its successor agency, in order to allow outdoor seating for restaurant purposes.
F. Legal Agreements Required for Public Open Space and Through-Block Pedestrian Connections. The owners of property to be used for public open space or through-block pedestrian connections shall retain fee ownership of that property and shall execute a legal agreement providing that such property is subject to a right of pedestrian use and access by the public. The agreement shall be in form and substance acceptable to the city attorney and be recorded with the King County recorder’s office and the city clerk. The obligations under the agreement shall run with the land and shall terminate upon demolition of the structure for which the through-block connection or public open space was provided. No modifications to either a public open space or through-block pedestrian connection shall be made without approval of the city other than ordinary repairs and maintenance. (Ord. 18C-14 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-24 (Att. A); Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.070 Greenery and outdoor spaces.
A. Objectives. Outdoor spaces and landscaping should be designed to achieve the design vision set forth in MICC 19.11.010. Development should provide for private open space for employees and residents. Plant materials placed in horizontal beds and on vertical walls/trellises/arbors areas should be used to frame and soften structures, to define site functions, to enhance the quality of the environment, screen undesirable views and create identity sense of place. Trees and landscaping shall be incorporated into the site design in order to soften and screen the visual impact of hard surfaces such as parking lots, service areas, and walls, as well as to enhance a sense of nature along pedestrian walkways, public rights-of-way, sidewalks and outdoor gathering places. Outdoor furniture and fixtures should be compatible with the project architecture and considered as integral elements of the landscape. Whenever possible development should include seating areas and be enhanced by such features as trees and flower displays, fountains, art and open spaces.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. Landscaped Area Requirement. Landscaped surfaces equal to 25 percent of the development site shall be provided. All required plantings and landscaping shall be installed according to sound horticultural practices in a manner designed to encourage quick establishment and healthy plant growth, based on local and regional best landscaping practices. The following landscaped types and credits may be used to meet the standards:
        a. Ground level planting beds qualify as landscaped surfaces at a 100 percent rate. Ground level planting area that supports trees (which will require deeper soil depths) may qualify for bonus credit. Specifically, planting areas that support a large tree (height greater than 30 feet at maturity) may be counted at a 200 percent rate (includes planting area under projected dripline at maturity) and planting areas that support a medium sized tree (height greater than 15 feet at maturity) may be counted at 150 percent rate. Terraced or other raised planting surfaces qualify as landscaped surfaces at the same rates as ground level planting beds depending on the soil depth (shallow soil depths capable of supporting only ground cover plants qualify at a 50 percent rate).
        b. Green Roof. Green roofs qualify as a landscaped surface at a 50 percent rate (i.e., two square feet of green roof qualifies as one square foot of landscaped area). Green roof areas supporting large shrubs and trees may qualify for bonus credit (up to a 100 percent rate) as determined by the design commission depending on the planting’s visibility.
        c. Green Walls/Trellises/Arbors.
            i. Artistic green walls adjacent to ground level publicly accessible space with decorative patterns qualify as a landscaped surface at a 125 percent rate;
            ii. Standard green walls qualify as landscaped surfaces at a 75 percent rate;
            iii. Vine trellis/arbors/walls qualify as landscaped surfaces at a 50 percent rate. Planter areas must feature minimum soil depth necessary to maintain healthy vine growing conditions as determined by regional best landscaping practices.
    2. Landscaping Standards. 
        a. Suitable Plant Species. Plant materials for required landscape surfaces shall be selected from a city approved palette of species and minimum size at time of planting. Plant materials should be native or adaptive drought-tolerant species.
        b. Trees and Ground Cover. 
            i. Prominent trees should be preserved to the extent feasible.
            ii. Trees planted within five feet of public curbs or in paved areas shall be installed with root guards and grates to prevent physical damage to sidewalks, curbs, gutters, pavement and other public or private improvements.
            iii. Ground cover shall be planted to have 100 percent ground cover in two years.
            iv. Any tree cutting or pruning shall be consistent with Chapter 19.10 MICC.
        c. Soil Quality, Depth, and Volume. Applicants for new projects in Town Center must include the relevant provisions in construction details, based on regional best landscaping practices, including:
            i. In planting beds: place three inches of compost and till to a minimum depth of eight inches.
            ii. In turf areas: place one and three-quarters inches of compost and till to a minimum depth of eight inches.
            iii. Scarify (loosen) subsoil four inches below amended layer to produce a minimum soil depth of 12 inches of uncompacted soil.
            iv. After planting: apply two to four inches of arborist wood chip mulch to planting beds. Coarse bark mulch may be used but has fewer benefits to plants and soil.
        d. Irrigation. All landscaped areas shall be provided with an approved automatic irrigation system consisting of waterlines, sprinklers designed to provide head to head coverage and to minimize overspray onto structures, walks and windows. Water conserving types of irrigation systems should be used.
        e. Maintenance. All landscaping shall be maintained in good condition. Maintenance shall include regular watering, mowing, pruning, clearance of debris and weeds, removal and replacement of dead plants and the repair and replacement of irrigation systems.
    3. Surface Parking Lot Landscaping. Surface parking lots shall be landscaped to reduce and break up large areas of asphalt and paving.
        a. The landscape design shall be incorporated with low impact development techniques designed to manage runoff from roofs, parking lots and other impervious surfaces.
        b. A minimum four-foot-wide (interior dimension) landscape bulb should be provided at the end of parking aisles.
        c. A ratio of one tree for every six parking spaces should be provided throughout any surface parking lot. Of the total number of trees required, 50 percent shall be a minimum of 24-inch box in size, and 50 percent shall be a minimum of 15-gallon in size.
        d. Planting areas for trees required within the parking rows of a surface parking lot should be achieved by one of the following acceptable methods:
            i. A continuous landscape strip, at least four feet wide (interior dimension), between rows of parking stalls; or
            ii. Tree wells, eight feet wide, resulting from the conversion of two opposing full sized parking stalls to compact stalls; or
            iii. Tree wells, at least five feet square, placed diagonally between standard or compact parking stalls.
    4. Landscape Screening. All grade-level parking should be physically separated from the street and visually screened from pedestrian view by landscaping. The landscaping must include shrubs and trees, be located on private property and be wide enough to maintain the plant material and screen the view but not less than three feet wide.
    5. Building Entries. Building entries should be emphasized with special landscaping and/or paving in combination with lighting.
    6. Building Facades. Building facade modulation and setbacks should include features such as courtyards, fountains and/or landscaping.
    7. Continuity. Landscaping should provide design continuity between the neighboring properties. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.080 Screening.
A. Objectives. In order to obtain the design vision set forth in MICC 19.11.010, any storage, service and truck loading areas, utility structures, elevator and mechanical equipment on the ground or roof shall be screened from public view in such a manner that they are not visible from public streets, sidewalks or residential areas located on the hillside surrounding the Town Center.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. On-Site Service Areas. All on-site service areas, loading zones, outdoor storage areas, garbage collection and recycling areas and similar activities should be located in an area not visible from public streets. Consideration should be given to developing common service courts at the interior of blocks. Service areas should accommodate loading, trash bins, recycling facilities, food scrap composting areas, storage areas, utility cabinets, utility meters, transformers, etc. Service areas should be located and designed for easy access by service vehicles and for convenient access by each tenant. Any emissions of noise, vapor, heat or fumes should be mitigated. Loading activities should generally be concentrated and located where they will not create a nuisance for adjacent uses.
    2. Garbage, Recycling Collection, Composting and Utility Areas. Garbage, recycling collection, food scrap composting and utility areas shall be enclosed and screened around their perimeter by a wall or fence at least seven feet high, concealed on the top and must have self-closing doors. If the area is adjacent to a public street or pedestrian alley, a landscaped planting strip, minimum three feet wide, shall be located on three sides of such facility. Any emissions of noise, vapor, heat or fumes should be mitigated.
    3. Meters and Mechanical Units. Water meters, gas meters, electric meters, ground-mounted mechanical units and any other similar structures should be hidden from public view or screened.
    4. Fences. Fences should be made of masonry, ornamental metal or wood, or some combination of the three. The use of chain link, plastic or wire fencing is prohibited. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.090 Lighting.
A. Objectives. Lighting shall be an integral part of any new or existing development. Lighting shall contribute to the individuality, security and safety of the site design without having overpowering effects on the adjacent areas. Lighting is viewed as an important feature, for functional and security purposes, as well as to enhance the streetscape and public spaces. The design of light fixtures and their structural support should be integrated with the architectural theme and style of the main structures on the site.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. Pedestrian-Scale Light Fixtures. Pedestrian-scale light fixtures should be incorporated into the site design to give visual variety from one building to the next and should blend with the architectural style.
    2. Light Type. Lighting should use LED or similar minimum wattage light sources, which give more “natural” light. Non-color corrected low-pressure sodium and mercury vapor light sources are prohibited.
    3. Building Entrances. All building entrances should be well lit to provide inviting access and safety.
    4. Building-Mounted and Display Window Lights. Building-mounted lights and display window lights should contribute to lighting of walkways in pedestrian areas.
    5. Parking Areas. Parking area light fixtures should be designed to confine emitted light to the parking area. The height of the light fixtures should not exceed 16 feet. The design commission shall review and determine the adequacy of lighting in parking areas based on best practices.
    6. Neon Lighting. Neon lighting may be used as a lighting element; provided, that the tubes are concealed and are an integral part of the building design. Neon tubes used to outline the building are prohibited.
    7. Shielding. All lighting fixtures should be shielded or located to confine light spread within the site boundaries, to the extent possible, especially when adjacent to residential uses. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.100 Building design.
A. Objectives. Building facades should be designed with a variety of architectural elements that suggest the building’s use and how it relates to other development in the area. Buildings should be oriented to the street frontage to enliven the street edge as well as to maximize access from the public sidewalk. Building facades should provide visual interest to pedestrians. Special care should be given to landscaping, mass and roof forms of buildings to provide visual interest from residential areas located on the hillside surrounding the Town Center as well as from public streets or sidewalks. Street level windows, minimum building setbacks, on-street entrances, landscaping and articulated walls should be encouraged. Building facades should be designed to achieve the purpose of the development and design standards and the Town Center vision described in MICC 19.11.010. Architectural features and other amenities should be used to highlight buildings, site features and entries and add visual interest. Within the Town Center, all development shall provide elements that attract the interest of residents, shoppers and workers.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. Fenestration. 
        a. Transparent Facades. Articulated, transparent facades should be created along pedestrian rights-of-way. Highly tinted or mirrored glass windows shall not be allowed. Shades, blinds or screens that prevent pedestrian view into building spaces shall not be allowed, except where required or desired for privacy in dwelling units, hotel rooms and similar residential uses.
        b. Ground Floor Windows and Doors. Major new construction along 77th Avenue SE, 78th Avenue SE and SE 27th Street, within the TC-5, TC-4 and TC-4 Plus subareas, shall have at least 75 percent of the length of the ground floor facade between the height of two feet and seven feet devoted to windows and doors affording views into retail, office, or lobby space.
        c. Upper Story Facades. Upper stories of buildings above two stories should maintain an expression line along the facade such as a setback, change of material, or a projection to reduce the perceived building mass. Upper story windows should be divided into individual units and not consist of a “ribbon” of glass. Upper story features such as balconies, roof decks, bay windows or upper story commercial activities should be used to visually connect upper story activity with the street.
    2. Street-Facing Facade Elements. All major new construction shall include at least seven of the following elements on the street-facing facades, both on the ground floor level and on other levels, as may be deemed desirable by the design commission taking into account the nature of the development and the site.
        a. Window and door treatments which embellish the facade.
        b. Decorative light fixtures.
        c. Unique facade treatment, such as decorative materials and design elements.
        d. Decorative paving.
        e. Trellises, railings, gates, grill work, or unique landscaping.
        f. Flower baskets supported by ornamental brackets.
        g. Recessed entrances.
        h. Balconies.
        i. Medallions.
        j. Belt courses.
        k. Decorative masonry and/or tilework.
        l. Unique, handcrafted pedestrian-scaled designs.
        m. Planter boxes with seasonal color.
        n. Projecting metal and glass canopy.
        o. Clerestories over storefront windows.
        p. Other elements as approved by the design commission.
    3. Major Facade Modulation. Block frontages shall include at least one of the following features (subsection (B)(3)(a), (b) or (c) of this section) at intervals no greater than 120 feet to break up the massing of the block and add visual interest. The design commission may approve modifications or alternatives to the following features if the proposed modulation is at least as aesthetically acceptable as one of the following features:
        a. Vertical building modulation at least 20 feet deep and 30 feet wide. See example on Figure 10. For multi-story buildings, the modulation must extend through more than one-half of the building stories.
        b. Use of a significant contrasting vertical modulated design component featuring all of the following:
            i. An extension through all stories above the first story fronting on the street. Exception: upper stories that are set back more than 10 feet horizontally from the facade are exempt.
            ii. A change in building materials that effectively contrast from the rest of the facade.
            iii. A modulation horizontally from the rest of the facade by an average of 24 inches.
            iv. A design to provide roofline modulation.
        c. Building walls with contrasting articulation and roofline modulation that make it appear like two or more distinct buildings. See examples on Figure 11. To qualify for this option, these contrasting facades shall employ all of the following:
            i. Different building materials and/or configuration of building materials; and
            ii. Contrasting window design (sizes or configurations).

    4. Minor Facade Modulation. All buildings shall include articulation features to reduce the perceived scale of large buildings and add visual interest to facades. See examples on Figure 13. At least three of the following features shall be employed at intervals no greater than 50 feet subject to design commission approval taking into account the nature of the development and the site:
        a. Window fenestration patterns and/or entries;
        b. Use of vertical piers/columns;
        c. Change in roofline;
        d. Change in building material or siding style;
        e. Vertical elements such as a trellis with plants, green wall, art element;
        f. Vertical building modulation of at least 12 inches in depth if tied to a change in roofline modulation or a change in building material, siding style, or color; or
        g. Other design techniques approved by the design commission that reinforce a pattern of small storefronts (or residences, if residential uses are used).

        [IMAGE: <19.11.100_004.jpg>]
    5. Walls. Untreated blank walls are prohibited. A blank wall is a wall (including building facades and retaining walls) over six feet in height, with a horizontal length greater than 15 feet that does not include a transparent window or door. Methods to treat blank walls can include but are not limited to:
        a. Display windows at least 16 inches of depth to allow for changeable displays. Tack on display cases shall not qualify as a blank wall treatment.
        b. A landscape planting bed at least five feet wide or a raised planter bed at least two feet high and three feet wide in front of the wall with planting materials that are sufficient to obscure or screen at least 60 percent of the wall’s surface within three years.
        c. A vertical trellis in front of the wall with climbing vines or plant materials.
        d. A mural as approved by the design commission.
        e. Special building detailing that adds visual interest at a pedestrian scale as approved by the design commission. Such detailing must use a variety of surfaces; monotonous designs will not meet the purpose of the standards.
    6. Entrances. Building entrances should concentrate along the sidewalk and should be physically and visually inviting. Entrance doors shall be recessed from the facade surface to emphasize the entrance and provide a sheltered transition to the interior of the building. Special paving treatments and/or landscaping should be used to enhance the entrance. Pedestrian walkways with wheelchair ramps at least eight feet wide should be constructed between the sidewalk and building entrances.
    7. Roofs. Roofs shall relate to the building facade articulations. A variety of roof types and configurations should be used to add interest and reduce the perceived building mass. Varied parapet height or roofline is encouraged. Sloping roofs are also encouraged.
    8. Residential Uses on Ground Floor. Where permitted, residential uses on the ground floor shall comply with the standards in MICC 19.11.060(E)(2)(e).
    9. Identity Emphasis. Public buildings, unique community structures and corner structures should have a prominent scale, emphasizing their identity.
    10. Corner Lots. Buildings on corner lots should be oriented to the corner. Corner entries and/or architectural treatment should be used to emphasize the corner.
    11. Franchise Design. Prototype design for franchises should use customized components consistent with the design requirements for the Town Center that achieve the purpose, intent and vision set forth in MICC 19.11.010.
    12. Harmony. The elements of a building should relate logically to each other, as well as to the surrounding buildings. A single building or complex should be stylistically consistent; architectural style, materials, colors and forms should all work together.
    13. Weather Protection. Specially designed all-weather features that integrate weather protection systems at the sidewalk level of buildings to protect pedestrians from the effects of rain, wind, glare, shadow, reflection and sunlight and to make spending time outdoors feasible in all seasons. All major new construction shall have awnings, canopies, trellises, pergolas, covered arcades or all-weather features along 80 percent of a building’s frontage along the retail frontages shown on Figure 2.
        a. Any canopy or awning over a public sidewalk should be a permanent architectural element.
        b. Any canopy or awning over a public sidewalk should project out from the building facade a minimum horizontal width of six feet and be between eight to 12 feet above grade.
        c. Architectural details should not be concealed by awnings or canopies.
        d. Awning shapes should relate to the shape of the facade’s architectural elements. The use of traditionally shaped awnings is encouraged.
        e. Vinyl or plastic awnings or canopies are prohibited.
        f. All awnings or canopies shall function to protect pedestrians from rain and other weather conditions.
    14. Courtyards. Courtyards are an outdoor covered or uncovered area easily accessible to the public at the same level as the public sidewalk or pedestrian connections. If a courtyard is being provided for purposes of meeting the public open space requirement in MICC 19.11.060(B), then the courtyard shall comply with the design standards for public open space in MICC 19.11.060(D). Other courtyards should:
        a. Be at least 10 feet in width, with a building facade on at least one side;
        b. Be covered with trees, ground cover, or other landscaping over at least 50 percent of its area;
        c. Include seating, special paving material, pedestrian-scale lighting and other pedestrian furnishings;
        d. Manage runoff from courtyard pavement with low impact development techniques when allowed by the code official; and
        e. Not be covered by a roof, story or skybridge; except that portions of the courtyard may be covered for weather protection, but not enclosed. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.110 Materials and color.
A. Objectives. Textured high quality materials and colors should bring a visually interesting experience into the streetscape. Color should be carefully considered in relation to the overall design of the building and surrounding buildings. Color and materials should highlight architectural elements such as doors, windows, fascias, cornices, lintels, and sills. Variations in materials and colors should be generally limited to what is required for contrast or to accentuate architectural features. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials should be avoided. The materials and colors selected should be consistent with the intent, purpose and vision set forth in MICC 19.11.010.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. Building Exteriors. Building exteriors should be constructed from high quality and durable materials. It is important that the materials and colors weather well and that building exteriors need minimal maintenance.
    2. Regional Focus. Materials and colors should reflect the city’s regional setting.
    3. Attention to All Sides. Materials and colors should be used with cohesiveness and compatibility on all sides of a building.
    4. Concrete Walls. Concrete walls should be architecturally treated. The treatment may include textured concrete such as exposed aggregate, sand blasting, stamping or color coating.
    5. Harmonious Range of Colors. A harmonious range of colors should be used within the Town Center. Neon or very bright colors, which have the effect of unreasonably setting the building apart from other adjacent buildings on the street, should not be used.
    6. Bright Colors. Bright colors should be used only for trim and accents if the use is consistent with the building design and other design requirements.
    7. Undesired Materials. Beveled metal siding, mirrored glass, and vinyl siding should not be used. EIFS, stucco and similar materials should be limited to use as a minor building facade element.
    8. Variation of Materials. A variation of building materials should be used to assist in the creation of a visually interesting experience. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.120 Street standards.
All major new construction abutting 77th Avenue SE or 78th Avenue SE shall improve the right-of-way adjacent to the property as required in Figure 14. Major new construction abutting all other streets shall improve the right-of-way adjacent to the property as required by the Mercer Island Town Center Streetscape Manual. The design commission may require or grant a modification to the nature or extent of any required street improvement for any of the following reasons upon recommendation by the city engineer:
A. If unusual topographic or physical conditions preclude the construction of the improvements as required; or
B. If the required improvement is part of a larger project that has been scheduled for implementation in the city’s six-year capital improvement program; or
C. If angled parking is required but parallel parking would enhance pedestrian, vehicle or bicycle safety, or result in a more desirable pedestrian environment; or
D. If other unusual circumstances preclude the construction of the improvements as required.

19.11.130 Parking, vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
A. Objectives. The Town Center should be accessible for vehicles but have an emphasis toward the needs of pedestrians. Clear, easy to understand circulation should be designed into all development to allow drivers and pedestrians to move safely on and off the site, and within it, without confusion and without disrupting on-street traffic flow. Development should maintain mobility and maximize opportunities for alternative modes of transportation in the Town Center. Placement of structures, landscaping, circulation patterns and access points should collectively seek to promote an integrated, multi-modal transportation system. The harmonious integration of pedestrian and transit user circulation should be considered in every aspect of site design. Development shall provide adequate parking with safe and convenient pedestrian access. Parking stalls shall be located within a structure, underground or behind buildings. Parking structures should not dominate the street frontage, and must blend with the building’s architectural theme. Creatively designed, clean and functional pedestrian connections are encouraged to provide access through-blocks, between properties and/or to and from the public right-of-way. Parking shall be designed consistent with the urban design vision set forth in MICC 19.11.010 and complement the pedestrian activities.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. Parking Requirements. 
        a. Minimum Number of Parking Stalls Required. All new development and remodels greater than 10 percent of the existing gross floor area shall provide at least the number of parking stalls set forth in the following table:

        +--------------------------+----------------------------+---------------------------+
        b. Determination within Range. The code official shall have the final authority to determine the number of parking stalls required within the ranges above to accommodate typical daily peak parking demand based upon the applicant’s submittal of a completed site plan and detailed parking analysis.
        c. Underground or Structured Parking Required. If the applicant for a mixed use project or for a residential project provides more parking than one and one-quarter spaces per dwelling unit for any part of a project consisting of residential units or two and one-half spaces per 1,000 square feet for any part of a project that is not used for residential units, then all such additional parking shall either be underground or on the second or higher story of structured parking. This subsection shall not apply to additional parking spaces that may be required pursuant to MICC 19.01.050.
        d. Parking Lot Configuration. Parking lot design shall conform to the standard stall diagrams set out in Appendix A to this title, unless alternative design standards are approved by the design commission and the city engineer. No more than 50 percent of the required off-street parking spaces for office and residential uses may be designed for accommodating compact vehicles. No more than 25 percent of the required off-street parking spaces for all other uses may be designed for accommodating compact vehicles. Such parking spaces must be clearly designated as compact stalls.
        e. Shared Parking.
            i. The amount of off-street parking required in subsection (B)(1)(a) of this section may be reduced by no more than 50 percent, as determined by the code official upon approval by the city engineer (and design commission for major new construction), when shared off-street parking facilities for two or more uses are proposed. A parking demand study shall be prepared by a professional traffic engineer and submitted by the applicant that documents parking demand for all land uses shall not significantly overlap and that uses will be served by adequate parking if shared parking reductions are authorized.
            ii. The determination whether shared parking will be allowed shall occur at the time the shared parking is proposed and when a change of use occurs.
            iii. If shared parking is requested, the parking facilities for the multiple uses shall be designed and developed as a single on-site common parking facility, or as a system of on-site and off-site facilities. If off-site facilities are used, all facilities shall be connected with improved pedestrian facilities and no building or use should be more than 1,320 feet walking distance from the most remote shared parking facility.
            iv. If the shared parking is on one or more different properties, a covenant or other contract for shared parking between the cooperating property owners must be approved by the code official. This covenant or contract shall be recorded with the King County department of records and elections division as a deed restriction on all properties and cannot be modified or revoked without the consent of the code official.
            v. If requirements for shared parking are violated, or the parking demand for shared parking exceeds the shared parking supply, the affected property owners shall provide a remedy satisfactory to the code official or provide the full amount of required off-street parking for each use, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
        f. Access Restriction Prohibited. Restricting vehicular and pedestrian access between adjoining parking lots at the same grade is prohibited.
        g. Surface Parking Lot Location.
            i. Behind Structure. All surface parking lots shall be located behind building structures.
            ii. No Corner Parking Lots. Parking lots shall not be located on a corner facing an intersection.
        h. Design of Surface Parking and Pedestrian Access.
            i. Entrances. 
                (a) Shared. The number of parking lot entrances, driveways and curb cuts should be minimized in favor of combined driveways and coordinated parking areas among business owners.
                (b) 78th Avenue SE. Individual parking entrances and curb cuts on 78th Avenue SE should be consolidated.
            ii. Pedestrian Walkways. Pedestrian walkways should be provided through all parking lots. Raised concrete pavement should be provided where the walkway traverses between parking stalls and/or is adjacent to vehicular circulation.
            iii. Landscaping and Lighting. Landscaping and lighting of surface parking lots should be in conformance with MICC 19.11.070(B)(4) and 19.11.090(B)(5).
            iv. Concrete Curbs. All parking areas, landscaping areas and driveways should be surrounded by six-inch-high vertical concrete curbs.
            v. Wheel Stops. All landscape and pedestrian areas should be protected from encroachment by parked cars. Wheel stops two feet wide (as measured outward from the paved or planted area) should be constructed for all nonparallel parking stalls.
            vi. Amenities. Amenities such as seating and planters should be provided to encourage pedestrian circulation.
        i. Design of Structured Parking.
            i. Relationship to Main Building. Parking structures should be architecturally integrated or designed with an architectural theme similar to the main building.
            ii. Screening. A floor of a parking structure should not face the street. If the design commission determines that there is no feasible alternative to a street-facing floor of a parking structure, then the perimeter of the floor of a parking structure facing the street should have a screening mechanism designed to shield vehicles and any mechanical appurtenances from public views.
            iii. Street Side Edges. An architectural treatment, landscaping and/or space for pedestrian-oriented businesses along the street-side edges of the parking structure shall be provided.
            iv. Pedestrian Access. Where possible, pedestrian elevators and stairwells serving structured parking shall be located in a public lobby space or out onto an active public street.
    2. Signs and Wayfinding. Signs indicating the location of parking available to the public shall be installed as approved by the design commission and city engineer. Such signs shall be installed at the entrance to the parking lot/garage along the street and within the parking lot/garage and shall comply with parking signage standards for the Town Center approved by the design commission and city engineer.
    3. Loading Space. Off-street loading space with access to a public street shall be required adjacent to or within or underneath each building. Such loading space shall be of adequate size to accommodate the maximum number and size of vehicles simultaneously loaded or unloaded in connection with the business or businesses conducted in the building. No part of the vehicle or vehicles using the loading space may protrude into the public right-of-way.
    4. Drive-Through Facilities. Drive-through facilities and stacking lanes should not be located along the street frontage of a building that faces a right-of-way. Stacking lanes shall be designed so as to accommodate all vehicles on site, and no part of a vehicle using a drive-through facility shall protrude into the public right-of-way.
    5. Public Parking. On-site public parking consistent with and complying with the requirements of this section shall be provided in any existing development desiring to provide public parking consistent with the requirements of this section and in any new mixed use or nonresidential development. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prevent a building owner from designating parking spaces as being available to the public exclusively for electric vehicle charging or as being available exclusively to an operator of a car sharing service that makes vehicles available for public use. Further, this section shall be interpreted and enforced in such manner as to avoid conflict with the shared parking section in subsection (B)(1)(e) of this section.
        a. All parking stalls provided for nonresidential uses, or if the primary use in the building is office then for nonoffice uses, or if the primary use of the building is hotel/motel then for non-hotel/motel uses, shall be available for public parking; provided, however, parking stalls that the code official concludes were required to be dedicated for the use of a specific tenant in accordance with a written lease provision in effect as of January 12, 2013, and which were specifically signed for that purpose on January 12, 2013, may be excluded from this requirement until the earlier of the expiration, termination, modification or amendment of the lease.
        b. Public parking stalls shall be available to motorists for such maximum time period as is determined by the owner, which shall not be less than two hours.
        c. An owner may require that the motorist patronize at least one business in the development but otherwise the motorist will be entitled to leave the development without moving the parked vehicle, subject to the maximum time period specified by the owner as provided in subsection (B)(5)(b) of this section.
        d. Once public parking is provided under this provision, it may not thereafter be eliminated unless the development changes use that does not require public parking.
        e. Public parking under this provision shall not be required for a new mixed use or nonresidential development that is: (i) two stories or less, and (ii) no greater than 10 percent of the total gross floor area of all existing structures on the parcel as of October 30, 2015.
    6. Repurposing of Parking Stalls.
        a. Parking stalls required for nonresidential uses in a new development or existing development by the foregoing provisions of this section must be kept available exclusively to provide parking for nonresidential uses in that development, as applicable. For parking stalls required for office use, this requirement shall only apply on weekdays between 7 am and 6 pm, excluding national holidays. Up to 50 percent of such stalls designated for office use may be allocated for residential use during the hours of 6 pm and 7 am weekdays and at all times on weekends and national holidays.
        b. Owners or operators of developments in which such parking stalls are located are responsible for ensuring that such parking stalls are, in fact, occupied as above required only by vehicles of persons associated with the respective uses and are not being occupied by other vehicles. Compliance with, and allowing public parking in accordance with, the provisions of subsection (B)(5) of this section or shared parking in accordance with subsection (B)(1)(e) of this section shall not be considered a violation of this exclusive use requirement. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.140 Signs.
A. Objectives. Signs shall be distinctive, finely crafted and designed to enhance the aesthetics of the Town Center and to improve pedestrian and motorist safety. Signs shall be designed for the purpose of identifying the business in an attractive and functional manner and to help customers find the specific business locations; they should not serve as general advertising. The size of signs shall be in proportion to the size of business store frontage. Signs shall be integrated into the building design, compatible with their surroundings and clearly inform pedestrians and motorists of business names, but should not detract from the architectural quality of individual buildings.
B. Development and Design Standards. 
    1. Freestanding Ground Signs.
        a. Number. A building or complex may not display more than one ground sign on each street frontage.
        b. Design. The sign shall be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and details of the building. The sign content should be integrated in one design (in contrast to displaying two or more separate elements). Use of symbols is encouraged.
        c. Size. All signs shall be:
            i. Proportionate. Proportionate to the street frontage of the businesses they identify; and
            ii. Maximum Size. In no case larger than:
                (a) Twenty-five square feet. A maximum of 25 square feet for individual business ground signs, shopping complex identification ground signs and signs within a 10-foot setback from any property line on a street.
                (b) Fifty square feet. A maximum of 50 square feet for joint ground signs (identifying more than one business): six square feet for each business included in the complex. When more than five businesses are included in the complex, one additional ground sign may be placed on the street front, if signs are located at least 100 feet apart.
        d. Maximum Height. The maximum height of any sign within 10 feet from any property line on a street shall be 42 inches. All other ground signs shall be a maximum of six feet in height. The height of a freestanding ground sign is measured from the top of the sign to the existing grade or finished grade, whichever is lower, directly below the sign being measured.
        e. Backs of Signs. Exposed areas of backs of signs should be finished to present an attractive appearance.
    2. Wall Signs.
        a. Eligibility. A wall sign shall be granted to commercial uses occupying buildings facing the streets and are limited to one sign per business on each street frontage. Commercial uses occupying a building adjacent to a driveway shall not qualify for a second wall sign. However, a commercial use occupying a building whose only exposure is from a driveway or parking lot shall be allowed one wall sign. Businesses that demonstrate that the entry off a driveway or parking lot is used by customers shall be eligible for a wall sign.
        b. Size. All signs shall be:
            i. Proportionate. Proportionate to the street frontage of the businesses they identify; and
            ii. Maximum Size. In no case larger than:
                (a) Twenty-five square feet. Twenty-five square feet for individual business signs.
                (b) Fifty square feet. Fifty square feet for joint business directory signs identifying the occupants of a commercial building and located next to the entrance.
        c. Determination of Size. The sign size is measured as follows:
            i. “Boxed” Displays. “Boxed” display – total area of display including the background and borders.
            ii. Individual Letters and Symbols. Individual letters and symbols – total combined area of a rectangle drawn around the outer perimeter of each word and each symbol.
        d. Placement. Wall signs may not extend above the building parapet, soffit, the eave line or the roof of the building, or the windowsill of the second story.
        e. Signs above Window Displays. When a commercial complex provides spaces for signs above window displays, these signs should be compatible in shape, scale of letters, size, color, lighting, materials and style.
        f. Design Commission Discretion. If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the design commission that a wall sign is creative, artistic and an integral part of the architecture, the commission may waive the above restrictions.
        g. Master Sign Plan. When multiple signs for individual businesses are contemplated for a major construction project, a master sign plan stipulating the location and size of future signs will be required.
    3. Projecting Signs.
        a. Sidewalk Clearance. Projecting signs should clear the sidewalk by a minimum of eight feet.
        b. Maximum Size. Projecting signs shall not be larger than six square feet.
        c. Projection from Building. Signs should not project over four feet from the building unless the sign is a part of a permanent marquee or awning over the sidewalk.
        d. Awnings. Awnings that incorporate a business sign shall be fabricated of opaque material and shall use reverse channel lettering. The design commission may require that an awning sign be less than the maximum area for wall signs to assure that the awning is in scale with the structure. Back-lit or internally lit awnings are prohibited.
    4. Window Signs.
        a. Area Limitation. Permanent and temporary window signs are limited to maximum 25 percent of the window area.
        b. Integration with Window Display. Every effort should be made to integrate window signs with window display.
    5. Parking Lot Signs. Signs within parking lots should be limited to those necessary for safety, identification and direction. The code official shall specify required wording for signage identifying public parking required by MICC 19.11.130(B)(2).
    6. Directional Signs.
        a. Minimal Number. To avoid a cluttered appearance, only those directional signs necessary to protect the safety of pedestrians and passengers in vehicles will be allowed. The code official may, however, require directional signs as necessary to provide motorists with required information to find parking area entrances.
        b. Size. These signs shall be no higher than 36 inches and no larger than four square feet.
    7. Temporary Signs. Unless prohibited by this chapter, use of temporary signs in the Town Center shall be governed by MICC 19.06.020, Temporary signs.
    8. Prohibited Signs.
        a. Roof. Signs mounted on the roof are not permitted.
        b. Moving Signs. Animated, moving, flashing, blinking, reflecting, revolving, or other similar signs or signs that incorporate these elements are prohibited.
        c. Pennants and Inflated Signs. Pennants or inflated signs, balloons and figures are prohibited.
        d. Vehicles. Signs attached to or painted on vehicles parked and visible from the public right-of-way are prohibited if, based on the relative amount of time the vehicle is parked rather than being used as a means for actual transportation, the vehicle’s primary purpose is as a stationary sign rather than a means for actual transportation.
        e. Phone Numbers. Phone numbers are prohibited from permanent, exterior signs.
    9. Lighted Signs. Lighted signs shall be of high quality and durable materials, distinctive in shape, designed to enhance the architectural character of the building and use LED lights or other minimum wattage lighting, as necessary to identify the facility or establishment. Channel or punch-through letters are preferred over a sign that contains text and/or logo symbols within a single, enclosed cabinet.
    10. Street Numbers. 
        a. Use. City-assigned street numbers should be installed on all buildings.
        b. Effect on Permitted Sign Area. Street numbers will not be counted towards permitted sign area.
    11. Design Commission Discretion. If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the design commission that a sign is creative, artistic and an integral part of the architecture, the commission may waive the above restrictions.
    12. Master Sign Plan. When multiple signs for individual businesses are contemplated for a major construction project, a master sign plan stipulating the location and size of future signs will be required. (Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

19.11.150 Administration.
A. Design Review. 
    1. Authority. Design review shall be conducted by the city’s design commission or code official consistent with the procedure set forth in MICC 19.15.220(C). The design commission or the code official shall review the applicability of the development and design standards and determine the project’s conformance with this chapter. The degree of conformance with all of the development and design standards will vary on a project-by-project basis. The design commission shall review each project on the project’s degree of overall conformity with the objectives, standards and the comprehensive plan. The design commission or the code official has the authority to approve, approve with conditions, or deny projects based on the criteria set forth in MICC 19.15.220(C).
    2. Applicant’s Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the applicant to design a project in compliance with the objectives and development and design standards of this chapter.
    3. Shall/Should. When a standard uses the word “shall,” the standard is mandatory. When a standard uses the word “should,” the standard is mandatory unless the applicant can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the design commission, an equal or better means of satisfying the standard and objective.
    4. Development Agreements. An applicant may request modifications to any development and design standards set forth in this chapter by requesting a development agreement consistent with RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210. All development agreements shall be in form and content acceptable to the city attorney and shall be reviewed and either approved or rejected by the city council after a public hearing pursuant to RCW 36.70B.200.
    5. Changes of Use and Tenant Improvements. It is the property owners’ and tenants’ responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable development regulations when a change of use and/or a tenant improvement occurs. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-12 § 9; Ord. 16C-06 § 2 (Exh. A)).

Chapter 19.12 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ZONES OUTSIDE TOWN CENTER

Sections:
19.12.010    General.
19.12.020    Site features and context.
19.12.030    Building design and visual interest.
19.12.040    Landscape design and outdoor spaces.
19.12.050    Vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
19.12.060    Screening of service and mechanical areas.
19.12.070    Lighting.
19.12.080    Signs.

19.12.010 General.
A. Applicability. This chapter establishes design standards for regulated improvements in all zones established by MICC 19.01.040, except Town Center. Design standards for Town Center are set forth in Chapter 19.11 MICC. These standards are in addition to any other standards that may be applicable to development in the zone in which the development occurs. In the PBZ, the terms of the PBZ site plan as set forth in MICC 19.04.010 shall control; provided, to the extent not inconsistent with MICC 19.04.010, the provisions of MICC 19.12.010 [excluding (D)(2)(b) and (c)], 19.12.030, 19.12.060, 19.12.070 and 19.12.080 shall apply. These design standards are not intended to slow or restrict development, but to add consistency and predictability to the permit review process.
B. Design Vision. 
    1. Site and Context. Non-Town Center areas are largely characterized by residential settings that are heavily vegetated, topographically diverse and enhanced with short and long-range views that are often territorial in nature. The design of new and remodeled structures should respond to this strong environmental context. Site design should maintain the natural character of the island and preserve vegetation concentrations, topography and the view opportunities that make Mercer Island special.
    2. Building Design. Development of new and remodeled structures should conserve Mercer Island’s special environmental characteristics, such as steep slopes, watercourses, and large concentrations of mature trees. Buildings shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with other structures in the neighborhood with respect to human scale, form and massing, and relationship to natural site features. High quality and durable materials, complementary colors, texture, and architectural detail should be incorporated into the design. Use of materials such as natural wood and stone, and design elements such as large building overhangs and window exposure to natural light, are encouraged.
    3. Landscaping and Amenities. Landscaping should reflect the natural wooded character of Mercer Island and provide visual separation between different land uses. Amenities such as street trees, plantings, and other landscape design elements, including fountains or water features, and art features should be integrated into new and remodeled structures and their sites.
C. Applicant’s Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the applicant to design a project in compliance with the objectives and standards of this chapter and all other regulations applicable to the zone in which the development occurs.
D. Design Review Process. Design review shall be conducted by the city’s design commission or code official consistent with the process provided in MICC 19.15.220(C). The design commission or code official shall review each regulated improvement and determine each project’s conformance with the applicable objectives and standards of this chapter.
    1. Full Application of Design Requirements: Major New Construction. All design requirements of Chapter 19.12 MICC shall apply, except as provided in MICC 19.01.050(D)(3)(a), when there is new construction from bare ground, or intentional exterior alteration or enlargement of a structure over any three-year period that incurs construction costs in excess of 50 percent of the existing structure’s current King County assessed value as of the time the initial application for such work is submitted; provided, application of Chapter 19.12 MICC shall not be construed to require an existing structure to be demolished or relocated, or any portion of an existing structure that is otherwise not being worked on as part of the construction to be altered or modified.
    2. Partial Application of Design Requirements: Minor Exterior Modification. The following design requirements shall apply when there is a minor exterior modification, as defined in MICC 19.16.010:
        a. MICC 19.12.030 pertaining to building design and visual interest;
        b. MICC 19.12.040(B)(5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (11) pertaining to landscape design and outdoor spaces: entrance landscaping; planting types; screen types and widths by use and location; perimeter landscape screens; surface parking lot planting; and general planting, irrigation and maintenance standards;
        c. MICC 19.12.050 pertaining to vehicular and pedestrian circulation;
        d. MICC 19.12.060 pertaining to screening of service and mechanical areas;
        e. MICC 19.12.070 pertaining to lighting;
        f. MICC 19.12.080 pertaining to signs;
    The design requirements pertaining to structures shall be applied only to that portion of an existing structure that undergoes minor exterior modification and shall not require any portion of an existing structure that is otherwise not being worked on as part of the construction to be altered or modified.
    3. Value Measure When Structure Has No Assessed Value. For purposes of determining when a project will be considered major new construction or minor exterior modification, and the threshold for application of design requirements as set forth in subsections (D)(1) and (2) of this section, if there is no current King County assessed value for a structure, a current appraisal of the structure, which shall be provided by the applicant and acceptable to the code official, shall be used as the value point of reference.
E. Shall/Should. When a standard uses the word “shall,” the standard is mandatory. When a standard uses the word “should,” the standard is mandatory unless the applicant can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the design commission or code official, an equal or better means of satisfying the standard and objective.
F. Development Agreements. An applicant may request modifications to any design and development standards set forth in this chapter by requesting a development agreement consistent with RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210. All development agreements shall be in form and content acceptable to the city attorney and will be reviewed and either approved or rejected by the city council after a public hearing pursuant to RCW 36.70B.200.
G. Changes of Use and Tenant Improvements. It is the property owners’ and tenants’ responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable development regulations when a change of use and/or a tenant improvement occurs. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.020 Site features and context.
A. Objectives. 
    1. To encourage design that respects natural landforms, mature trees, and sensitive areas and uses them to provide project identity.
    2. To ensure site design is approached in a systematic and unified manner that takes advantage of inherent opportunities and complies with specific standards for building location and orientation.
    3. To link open space and recreation areas, where feasible, with public open space, parks, and trails.
    4. To encourage building and site designs that use natural elements which link new or modified development to the neighborhood.
    5. To promote functional and visual compatibility and better transitions between different uses, adjacent neighborhoods, and between development and natural features.
B. Standards. 
    1. Site Features. 
        a. Landforms. Design and layout of the site should incorporate natural landforms such as trees, topography and water courses into proposed developments. Cut and fill should be minimized and preservation of mature trees should be maximized, particularly adjacent to project boundaries and steep slopes. Natural contours should be respected and retained where feasible.
    2. Sloped or Hillside Development. 
        a. Building development should generally occur on the least steep portions of the site in order to conserve the more fragile areas for landscaping or general open space.
        b. Structures built on substantial slopes or hillsides should be designed to minimize their visual impact on surrounding areas. Ridgelines of major slopes should not be broken by structures or loss of vegetative cover. Acceptable methods to integrate structures into the hillside include, but are not limited to, height control, stepped construction, muted earth tone colors, and tree preservation.
        c. Building Orientation. Buildings should respond in design to a prominent feature, such as a corner location, a street or the lake. Buildings and site design should provide inviting entry orientation. Buildings should not turn their backs to the street.
    3. Relationship of Buildings to Site. 
        a. Site Design. Site design and architectural style shall be pedestrian in scale and address interface with public rights-of-way, vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
        b. Architectural Context. New development should reflect important design elements of existing structures in the neighborhood, including but not limited to, roof forms, materials and colors.
        c. Multiple Structures. Variable siting of individual buildings, heights of buildings, and building modulation should be used in order to provide variety in site and specific building design.
        d. Transitions to Neighborhoods. Proposed developments should transition with and not overpower adjoining permitted land uses through modulation of building facades, use of established setbacks, and installation of landscape buffers. Building designs should step down to lower heights adjacent to surrounding buildings.
        e. Decorative Landmarks. Imaginative exterior features that complement and are integrated into the building design and create visual focal points that give identity to an area, such as special paving in pedestrian areas, art features, decorative clocks, or water features should be provided. (Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.030 Building design and visual interest.
A. Objectives. 
    1. To ensure high quality materials and finishes are used to bring a visually interesting experience to the streetscape.
    2. To ensure that building design is based on a strong, unified, coherent, and aesthetically pleasing architectural concept.
    3. To not restrict the design to a particular style.
    4. To ensure that new buildings are appropriately designed for the site, maintain human scale, and enhance the architectural character of the neighborhood.
    5. To ensure buildings are detailed, provide visual interest, do not have blank walls and that large buildings are modulated and articulated to reduce their apparent mass and scale.
    6. To ensure high quality and durable buildings which will help to maintain and protect property values.
B. Standards. 
    1. Scale, Form and Mass. Scale, form, massing, building proportions, spacing of windows and doorways, roof silhouette, facade orientations, and style of architecture shall have a unified character and, as to commercial, regulated residential and regulated public facilities, recognize pedestrian needs.
        a. Scale. Building scale should be proportional to other adjacent buildings, the street edge and, as to commercial, regulated residential and regulated public facilities, to the pedestrian environment.
        b. Form and Mass. Building forms should not present visual mass or bulk impacts that are out of proportion to adjacent structures, or that appear from the public way or surrounding properties as having unmodulated visual bulk.
    2. Building Facades – Visual Interest. 
        a. Facade Modulation. Building facade modulation shall break up the overall bulk and mass of the exterior of buildings and structures. Such modulation should always be addressed on the horizontal plane and the vertical plane. Large or massive buildings should integrate features along their facades that are visible from the public right-of-way, pedestrian routes and nearby structures to reduce the apparent building mass and achieve an architectural scale consonant with other nearby structures.
        b. Modulation Guidelines. 
            i. Horizontal building facade modulation should occur at no less than every 50 feet of wall length. Forms of both vertical and horizontal building modulation may include, but are not limited to: facade indentations and extrusions; actual building separation; connecting atriums, courtyards and plazas; variable roof forms and overhangs; and decks and balconies.
            ii. Building facades visible from public ways and public spaces should be stepped back or projected forward at intervals to provide a minimum of 40 percent overall facade modulation.
        c. Ground Level Facades. Blank walls at the ground level that may be visible from a public view should be avoided. Ground level facades should create visual interest by utilizing features such as windows, wall articulation, arcades, trellises or other plant features.
        d. Fenestration. Fenestration should be integrated in the overall building design and should provide variety in facade treatment.
        e. Horizontal Variation and Emphasis. Building facades should be made more visually interesting through the use of reveals, medallions, belt courses, decorative tile work, clerestory windows, or other design features. The scale of the detail should reflect the scale of the building.
        f. Signs. Building design should allow space for a wall sign, consistent with the provisions of MICC 19.12.080, Signs, if it is anticipated that a wall sign will be used.
    3. Building Articulation. Design shall articulate building facades by use of variations of color, materials or patterns, or arrangement of facade elements that are proportional to the scale of the building. Architectural details that are used to articulate the structure may include reveals, battens, and other three dimensional details that create shadow lines and break up the flat surfaces of the facade.
        a. Tripartite Articulation. Tripartite building articulation (building top, middle, and base) should be used to create human scale and architectural interest.
        b. Fenestration. Fenestration should be used in facades visible from public ways and public spaces visible from public ways for architectural interest and human scale. Windows should be articulated with treatments such as mullions or recesses and complementary articulation around doorways and balconies should be used.
        c. Architectural Elements. The mass of long or large scale buildings should be made more visually interesting by incorporating architectural elements, such as arcades, balconies, bay windows, dormers, and/or columns.
        d. Upper Story Setback. Upper stories should be set back to reduce the apparent bulk of a building and promote human scale. When buildings are adjacent to single-family residential dwellings, upper story setbacks shall be provided from property lines.
    4. Materials and Color. 
        a. Durable Building Exteriors. Building exteriors should be constructed from high quality and durable materials that will weather well and need minimal maintenance.
        b. Consistency and Continuity of Design. Materials and colors generally should be used with consistency on all sides of a building.
        c. Material and Color Variation. Color and materials should highlight architectural elements such as doors, windows, fascias, cornices, lintels, sills and changes in building planes. Variations in materials and colors should generally be limited to what is required for contrast or to accentuate architectural features.
        d. Concrete Walls. Concrete walls should be architecturally treated. The enhancement may include textured concrete such as exposed aggregate, sand blasting, stamping or color coating.
        e. Bright Colors. Bright colors should be used only for trim and accents. Bright colors may be approved if the use is consistent with the building design and other design requirements. Fluorescent colors are prohibited.
    5. Building Entrances. 
        a. Architectural Features and Design. Special design attention should be given to the primary building entrance(s). A primary entrance should be consistent with overall building design, but made visually distinct from the rest of the building facade through architectural features. Examples include recessed entrances, entrances which roof forms that protrude from the building facade, and decorative awnings, canopies, porte-cocheres, and covered walkways.
        b. Entrance Connections. The primary entrance to a building should be easy to recognize and should be visible from the public way and/or physically connected to the public way with walkways. Landscaping should reinforce the importance of the entrance as a gathering place and create visual and physical connections to other portions of the site and to vehicular and pedestrian access points.
    6. Rooflines. 
        a. Roofline Variation, Interest, and Detail. Roofline variation, interest, and detail shall be used to reduce perceived building height and mass and increase compatibility with smaller scale and/or residential development. Roofline variation, interest and detail may be achieved through use of roofline features such as dormers, stepped roofs, and gables that reinforce a modulation or articulation interval, incorporation of a variety of vertical dimensions, such as multiplaned and intersecting rooflines, or flat-roofed designs that include architectural details such as cornices and decorative facings.
        b. Roofline Variation, Numeric Standard. Roof line variation shall occur on all multifamily structures with roof lines which exceed 50 feet in length, and on all commercial, office or public structures which exceed 70 feet in length. Roof line variation shall be achieved using one or more of the following methods:
            i. Vertical off-set ridge or cornice line;
            ii. Horizontal off-set ridge or cornice line;
            iii. Variations of roof pitch between 5:12 and 12:12; or
            iv. Any other approved technique which achieves the intent of this section.
    7. Additional Standards for Buildings Containing Residential Units. Buildings containing residential units should incorporate the following additional design elements to make them residential in character:
        a. Bay windows, dormers, patios or decks;
        b. Base articulation such as plinths; or
        c. Other techniques approved by the design commission which make the building residential in character.
    8. Corporate Design. Building and site design for chain or franchise businesses should use customized components consistent with the objectives and standards of this chapter. Specific icons or trademarks of a company may be used, but the overall design of the building and site must represent a development compatible with the neighborhood including its colors, materials, textures and treatment of design.
    9. All-Weather Features. All-weather features at the sidewalk, courtyard or public gathering space areas of commercial and regulated public facilities, such as awnings, canopies, covered walkways, trellises, or covered patios, should be provided to make spending time outdoors feasible in all seasons.
    10. Public schools should respect privacy for adjacent residential properties by providing appropriate screening and placement of windows in buildings. Distance from residential property lines should also be considered when determining the appropriate amount of screening and the type and placement of windows. (Ord. 14C-06 § 5; Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.040 Landscape design and outdoor spaces.
A. Objectives. 
    1. To ensure that landscape design reinforces the natural and wooded character of Mercer Island, complements the site, the architecture of site structures and paved areas, while enhancing the visual appearance of the neighborhood.
    2. To ensure that landscape design is based on a strong, unified, coherent, and aesthetically pleasing landscape concept.
    3. To ensure that landscape plantings, earth forms, and outdoor spaces are designed to provide a transition between each other and between the built and natural environment.
    4. To ensure suitable natural vegetation and landforms, particularly mature trees and topography, are preserved where feasible and integrated into the overall landscape design. Significant trees and tree stands should be maintained in lieu of using new plantings.
    5. To provide a vegetated screen between dissimilar uses, to screen surface parking areas from adjacent uses and public rights-of-way.
    6. To ensure planting designs include a suitable combination of trees, shrubs, groundcovers, vines, and herbaceous material; include a combination of deciduous and evergreen plant material; emphasize native plant material; provide drought tolerant species; and exclude invasive species.
B. Standards. Any quantitative standards contained in MICC 19.12.040(B) that specify types of plant material, quantities, spacing, and planting area widths are not intended to dictate a rigid and formal landscape. The applicant should incorporate the quantitative standards into a quality landscape and planting design that meets the stated objectives and standards of this section.
    1. Landscape Area. Landscape design shall address all areas of a site not covered by structures or used by automobiles. Landscape areas include open space, plantings, patios, plazas, pedestrian ways, trails, and other outdoor spaces. Surface parking lot planting and screening are required as set forth in MICC 19.12.040(B)(7), (8) and (9). Design review, however, shall be primarily concerned with: (a) areas of a site that require landscaping in order to address the impact of development on adjoining properties or public ways; and (b) parts of the development that are visible from adjoining properties or public ways.
    2. Outdoor Spaces. Outdoor spaces should be designed at a human scale and include hardscape spaces, spaces created by plant materials and combinations of the two.
        a. Strategically placed and useable pedestrian areas such as courtyards, plazas, outdoor seating or other gathering places should be provided for commercial, regulated residential and public facilities.
        b. On-site recreation areas appropriate to the users should be provided for residential and public projects.
        c. The design of outdoor spaces should combine necessary site functions, such as storm water detention, with open space and visual interest areas.
    3. Architectural Features. The design of landscape architectural features should be in scale with and complement the architecture of site structures and the visual character of the neighborhood.
        a. Use of architectural screens, arbors, trelliswork, art features, fountains and paving treatments such as wood, brick, stone, gravel and/or other similar methods and materials should be used in conjunction with native plant materials or in place of plant materials where planting opportunities are limited.
        b. Fences should be made of ornamental metal or wood, masonry, or some combination of the three. The use of razor wire, barbed wire, chain link, plastic or wire fencing is prohibited if it will be visible from a public way or adjacent properties, unless there are security requirements which cannot feasibly be addressed by other means.
        c. Fences should not create the effect of walled compounds that are isolated from adjacent developments and public ways.
    4. Minimum Landscape Area Requirements. 
        a. Total Landscaped Area. The following minimum areas shall be landscaped:
            i. Single-Family Residential (SF). For nonresidential uses in single-family residential zones (SF), a minimum of 35 percent of the gross lot area of shall be landscaped.
            ii. Multifamily Residential (MF). In multifamily residential zones (MF-2, MF-2L, MF-3), a minimum of 40 percent of the gross lot area shall be landscaped.
            iii. Planned Business Zone (PBZ). In the planned business zone (PBZ) landscape area requirements shall be as set forth in MICC 19.04.010.
            iv. Commercial Office (CO). In commercial office (CO) zones, a minimum of 40 percent of the gross lot area shall be landscaped.
            v. Business (B). In business (B) zones, a minimum of 25 percent of the gross lot area shall be landscaped; provided, for fuel stations, a minimum of 10 percent of the gross lot area shall be landscaped.
        b. Impervious Surfaces. For all zones, area landscaped by impervious surfaces should constitute no more than 25 percent of the total required landscape area; provided, for multifamily residential zones, area landscaped by impervious surfaces should constitute no more than 10 percent of the total required landscape area.
    5. Entrance Landscaping. For commercial and regulated public facilities, landscaping at entrances should frame an outdoor space near the entrance and reinforce this important building feature as a gathering place.
    6. Planting Material, Types and Design. The following planting types should be used:
        a. Native or northwest-adapted plants should be used for all open space and buffer locations and drought tolerant plantings should be used in a majority of plantings.
        b. New plantings should complement existing species native to the Pacific Northwest.
        c. Ground cover should be used to ensure planting areas are attractive, minimize maintenance and the potential for encroachment of invasive plant material. Ground cover should be planted and spaced to achieve total coverage within three years after installation.
    7. Perimeter Screen Types and Widths by Use and Location.

        1Breaks in full or partial screen planting may be allowed for institutional and public facilities to create focal points, preserve views, and highlight the prominence of important buildings.
        2Perimeter landscape requirements may be modified if necessary to enable an existing public facility to make safety-related improvements to a legally nonconforming parking lot.
        3School bus and student loading and unloading and primary parking areas located 100 feet or less from an abutting single-family zoned property shall provide a 30-foot-wide full screen. The number of trees required in the 30-foot-wide full screen area shall be 1.25 times the number otherwise required for a full screen. The design commission may modify screening width, location, height and number of trees to avoid casting shadows on adjacent residential properties or to accommodate existing storm detention systems and utilities.
        4Owners of adjacent single-family zoned property shall be consulted on perimeter screen design and planting materials.
        b. Perimeter Width Averaging. Averaging of screen widths may be allowed, if the objectives of this section, the minimum landscape area requirements set forth in MICC 19.12.040(B)(4) and the following criteria are met:
            i. Plant material is clustered to more effectively screen parking areas and structures; and
            ii. Significant trees are retained.
    8. Perimeter Landscape Screens. Perimeter landscape screens should be consistent with the following definitions of screen types. Where existing undergrowth will be retained, the shrub and ground cover requirements for all screen types may be adjusted, provided the objectives of this section are met.
        a. Full Screen. A full screen provides a dense vegetated separation between dissimilar uses on adjacent properties. A full screen should block views from adjacent properties as seen at the pedestrian eye level in all seasons within three years of installation. The number of trees provided shall be proportionate to one tree for every 10 feet of landscape perimeter length.
        b. Partial Screen. A partial screen provides a moderate vegetated separation between uses on adjacent properties and intermittent views to adjacent properties. A partial screen shall provide the desired screening function as seen at the pedestrian eye level in all seasons within three years of installation. The number of trees provided shall be proportionate to one tree for every 20 feet of landscape perimeter length.
        c. Filtered Screen. A filtered screen should provide in all seasons and within three years of installation a lightly vegetated visual separation between uses on adjacent properties and allow visual access to adjacent properties. When compared to the other screen types, a filtered screen should be characterized by more open spaces, light filtration and transparency through the plant material forming the screen.
    9. Surface Parking Lot Planting. Surface parking lot planting is required in addition to required perimeter landscape screens. The requirements for surface parking lot planting for new parking lots with fewer than 20 spaces and for additions or remodels may be waived or modified if the applicant can demonstrate that these standards would reduce the amount of parking below the minimum required for the site.
        a. Standards by Location. Surface parking lots not located adjacent to public rights-of-way should provide one tree for every six parking stalls. Surface parking lots located in the front of buildings or adjacent to public rights-of-way should provide one tree for every four parking stalls. Trees should be at least six feet high at the time of planting. All lots should have planting areas at the end of parking aisles.
        b. Common Standards for Surface Parking Lot Planting. The following standards apply to all surface parking lot planting:
            i. Shrubs. Shrubs should be maintained at a maximum three feet height within surface parking lots so views between vehicles and pedestrians will not be blocked. Irregular spacing and clustering is encouraged; however, the minimum number of shrubs shall be determined by assuming shrubs are planted on three foot centers throughout the entire planting area. Where vehicle headlights may project onto neighboring properties, shrubs shall be spaced to provide a continuous planting buffer.
            ii. Planting Islands or Strips. Planting islands or strips should have an area of at least 80 square feet and a narrow dimension of not less than five feet if wheel stops are provided to prevent vehicle overhang. A narrow dimension of not less than eight feet may be provided if the vehicle overhang area is included in the planting area.
            iii. Tree Location. In parking lots, trees should be planted no closer than four feet from pavement edges where vehicles overhang planted areas. Curb stops may be used to proportionally decrease this distance.
            iv. Narrow Planting Strips and Parking Spaces. Narrow parking lot islands or peninsulas and planting strips shall not be planted in sod. Location of wider parking spaces adjacent to islands is suggested to reduce damage to plant materials.
            v. Clustering of New Plant Material. Clustering of new plant material within surface parking lots may be approved if the objectives of this section are met.
    10. Landscape Grading Standards. 
        a. Slopes in Planting Areas. Graded slopes in planting areas should not exceed a 3(Horizontal): 1(Vertical) slope, in order to decrease erosion potential and to facilitate maintenance. Graded slopes planted with grass should not exceed a 4(H): 1(V) slope.
        b. Erosion Control. On ungraded slopes equal to or greater than 2(H): 1(V), erosion control netting or alternative procedures shall be used to prevent erosion.
        c. Guidelines. The obligation to install plants, shrubs and ground cover includes the obligation to utilize soil, planting practices and irrigation equipment that maximize the likelihood of their long-term survival.
    11. General Planting, Irrigation and Maintenance Standards. The following standards apply to the planting requirements set forth above:
        a. Coverage. Planting areas should be completely covered with trees, shrubs, flowers, mulched areas, and/or ground covers.
        b. Berms and Landforms. Earth berms and landforms in combination with shrubs and trees may be used to achieve the initial planting height requirement.
        c. Minimum Width. All planting areas should be a minimum of five feet in width. Planting areas should be wider wherever possible.
        d. Sight Clearance. At intersections, plantings shall not create sight obstructions that may compromise pedestrian or traffic safety.
        e. Planting Coverage. All required planting areas should extend to the ditch slope, curb line, street edge, or area of sidewalk.
        f. Curbs Required. Permanent curbs or structural barriers/dividers should enclose planting areas in vehicle use areas except when draining runoff from pavement to planting areas functioning as rain gardens or other low impact development facilities. Wheel stops should also be used to protect planting areas from damage due to cars overhanging the curb.
        g. Plantings Near Utilities. Trees shall not be planted within eight feet of a water or sewer pipeline. Shrubs shall be at least four feet from hydrants. A full screen will be required to screen above-ground utilities from adjacent uses and public rights-of-way. Perimeter plantings shall be clustered in areas to screen structures, utility structures, loading areas, trash enclosures, storage areas and mechanical equipment. This subsection shall not apply to utilities, structures, loading areas, enclosures or equipment unless the utility, structure, loading area, enclosure or equipment is being added as part of the regulated improvement being reviewed.
        h. Drainage. Planting areas shall be provided with adequate drainage.
        i. Maintenance Requirements. All required landscaping shall be maintained in good condition. Plant material should be cared for in a way that allows their natural form to be maintained, even when the plant reaches maturity. Performance guarantees to ensure maintenance or required landscaping may be required pursuant to MICC 19.01.060. (Ord. 14C-06 § 6; Ord. 10C-06 § 4; Ord. 09C-17 § 6; Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.050 Vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
A. Objectives. 
    1. To create an attractive street edge and unified streetscape, to encourage pedestrian activity in commercial areas, stimulate business, maintain adequate public safety, and create a sense of community.
    2. To provide for safe and efficient parking and loading areas while minimizing their visual and noise impacts.
    3. To provide safe and efficient pedestrian connections within and between projects and the public way to enhance safety and circulation.
B. Standards. 
    1. Vehicular Circulation Characteristics. 
        a. Parking Lot Design. Parking areas should be designed for efficient and safe ingress and egress by vehicles and should not inhibit safe pedestrian movement or circulation. Parking lot design should be subordinate to the overall site design and should be located behind new buildings when appropriate and physically feasible. Below grade parking is also encouraged. Planting strips should be incorporated between parking aisles in new and expanded parking lots where space permits. Parking lot development standards, such as stall and aisle dimensions, are contained in Appendix A.
        b. Loading Docks. Proposed development of features such as loading docks, and other features designed to support activities with a substantial likelihood of generating significant noise should be designed with noise attenuation walls and sited in a manner to limit impacts to adjacent properties and pedestrian areas.
    2. Pedestrian Circulation Characteristics. 
        a. Pedestrian Improvements. All developments shall provide for pedestrian access including pedestrian walkways, sidewalks, and/or paths. Areas for sitting and gathering should be provided as an integral part of regulated public facilities, regulated residential and commercial building design. Pedestrian improvements should be separated from vehicular areas by physical barriers such as curbs or landscaping. This requirement for new parking lots with fewer than 20 spaces and for additions or remodels may be waived or modified where the applicant can demonstrate that these standards would reduce the amount of parking below what would be required for the site.
        b. On-Site Circulation for Regulated Public Facilities and Commercial Buildings. Proposed development should be linked to existing and planned walkways and trails. Entrances of all buildings should be linked to each other and to public ways and parking lots. Where possible and feasible, the pedestrian system shall connect to paths or sidewalks on neighboring properties. (Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.060 Screening of service and mechanical areas.
A. Objectives. 
    1. To ensure that building and site appurtenances are properly integrated into the design concept.
    2. To properly screen mechanical equipment to reduce visual impacts.
    3. To ensure service and truck loading areas, utility structures, and elevators are screened from public view in such a manner that they are not visible from public ways or residential areas.
B. Standards. 
    1. Accessory Buildings. Ground level outdoor storage buildings, mechanical equipment and utility vaults shall be screened from adjacent public ways.
    2. Rooftop Mechanical Equipment and Appurtenances. All rooftop mechanical equipment shall not be visible and shall be enclosed, hidden or screened from adjacent properties, public ways and parks. Rooftop appurtenances are allowed if there is a functional need for the appurtenance and that functional need cannot be met with an appurtenance of a lesser height. This provision shall not be construed to allow building height in excess of the maximum limit. Rooftop appurtenances should be located at least 10 feet from the exterior edge of any building, and shall not cover more than 20 percent of the rooftop area. Appurtenances shall not be located on the roof of a structure unless they are hidden or camouflaged by building elements that were designed for that purpose as an integral part of the building design. All appurtenances located on the roof should be grouped together and incorporated into the roof design and thoroughly screened. The screening should be sight-obscuring, located at least 10 feet from the exterior edge of any building; and effective in obscuring the view of the appurtenances from public streets or sidewalks or residential areas surrounding the building.
    3. Meters and Mechanical Units. Water meters, gas meters, electric meters, ground-mounted mechanical units and any other similar structures should be hidden from public view or screened.
    4. On-Site Service Areas. All on-site service areas, loading zones, outdoor storage areas, garbage collection and recycling areas and similar activities should be located in an area not visible from public ways. Service areas should accommodate loading, trash bins, recycling facilities, storage areas, utility cabinets, utility meters, transformers, etc. Service areas should be located and designed for easy access by service vehicles and for convenient access by all tenants. Loading activities should generally be concentrated and located where they will not create a nuisance for adjacent uses. Loading docks shall meet the standards identified in MICC 19.12.050(B)(1)(b).
    5. Garbage, Recycling Collection and Utility Areas. Garbage, recycling collection and utility areas shall be enclosed and screened around their perimeter by a wall or fence at least seven feet high, concealed on the top and must have self-closing doors. If the area is adjacent to a public way or pedestrian alley, a landscaped planting strip, minimum three feet wide, shall be located on three sides of such facility.
    6. Fence, Trellis and Arbor Standards. Fences, trelliswork and arbors shall meet the standards identified in MICC 19.12.040(B)(3).
    7. Noise, Vapor, Heat or Fumes. With respect to all aspects of the development referred to above in this section, emissions of noise, vapor, heat or fumes should be mitigated. (Ord. 08C-01 § 7; Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.070 Lighting.
A. Objectives. 
    1. To regulate exterior lighting in order to avoid unsafe and unpleasant conditions as the result of poorly designed or installed exterior lighting.
    2. To discourage excessive lighting that negatively impacts adjacent land uses.
    3. To protect low and moderate density residential zones from the negative impacts associated with institutional, mixed-use, and commercial exterior lighting.
    4. To create a safe environment during hours of darkness.
    5. To ensure lighting is an integral part of any new or existing development. Lighting shall contribute to the individuality, security and safety of the site design without having overpowering effects on the adjacent areas.
    6. To ensure lighting is viewed as an important feature for functional and security purposes and that the design of light fixtures and their structural support is integrated with the architectural theme and style of the main structures on the site.
B. Standards. 
    1. Architectural Elements. Lighting should be designed as an integral architectural element of the building and site.
    2. Function and Security. On-site lighting shall be sufficient for pedestrian, bicyclist, and vehicular safety. Building entrances should be well lit to provide inviting access and safety. Building-mounted lights and window lights should contribute to lighting of walkways in pedestrian areas.
    3. Lighting Height. Freestanding, parking area, and building-mounted light fixtures shall not exceed 16 feet in height, including any standard or base.
    4. Shielding. All exterior lighting fixtures shall be shielded or located to confine light spread within the site boundaries. Full cut-off fixtures should be used. The use of unshielded incandescent lighting fixtures less than 160 watts and any unshielded lighting less than 50 watts may be allowed. Parking area light fixtures shall be designed to confine emitted light to the parking area.
    5. Uplighting of Structures and Signs. 
        a. Residential Zones. Structures in residential zones shall not be illuminated by uplighting. Limited uplighting of signs and plantings in residential zones may be approved provided there is no glare or spillover lighting off the site boundaries.
        b. Nonresidential Zones. Structures, signs, and plantings in nonresidential zones may be illuminated by uplighting, provided there is no glare or spillover lighting off the site boundaries.
    6. Light Type. Lighting should use low wattage color-corrected sodium light sources, which give more “natural” light. Metal halide, quartz, neon and mercury vapor lighting are prohibited in residential zones. High pressure sodium lights may only be used as street lights and must be fully shielded. (Ord. 04C-08 § 1).

19.12.080 Signs.
A. Objectives. 
    1. Signs shall be distinctive in shape, of high quality and durable materials, designed to enhance the architectural character of the building and use the minimum wattage necessary to identify the facility or establishment. Channel or punch-through letters are preferred over a sign that contains the text and/or logo symbols within a single, enclosed cabinet.
    2. Signs shall be designed for the purpose of identifying the facility or establishment in an attractive and functional manner and to help customers find the specific establishment and location; signs in residential zones should not serve as general advertising.
    3. The size of signs shall be proportional to the size of the building and site.
    4. Signs shall be integrated into both the site design and building design, shall be compatible with their residential, office, or business, or public park or open space surroundings, and clearly inform viewers of building or activity use, but shall not detract from the architectural quality of individual buildings or park surroundings.
B. Standards. 
    1. Freestanding Ground Signs Outside Residential Zones. 
        a. Number. An individual building or a building complex outside residential zones may display one ground sign on each street frontage.
        b. Design. The sign shall be architecturally compatible with the style, materials, colors and details of the building or complex. Use of symbols is encouraged.
        c. Size. All signs shall be:
            i. Proportionate. Proportionate to the street frontage of the use they identify; and

19.15.010 Purpose, intent and roles.
A. Purpose. Administration of the development code is intended to be expedient and effective. The purpose of this chapter is to identify the processes, authorities and timing for administration of development permits. Public noticing and hearing procedures, decision criteria, appeal procedures, dispute resolution and code interpretation issues are also described.
B. Objectives. Guide customers confidently through the permit process; process permits equitably and expediently; balance the needs of permit applicants with neighbors; allow for an appropriate level of public notice and involvement; make decisions quickly and at the earliest possible time; allow for administrative decision-making, except for those decisions requiring the exercise of discretion which are reserved for appointed decision makers; ensure that decisions are made consistently and predictably; and resolve conflicts at the earliest possible time.
C. Roles and Responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities for carrying out the provisions of the development code are shared by appointed boards and commissions, elected officials and city staff. The authorities of each of these bodies are set forth below.
    1. City Council. The city council is responsible for establishing policy and legislation affecting land use within the city. The city council acts on recommendations of the planning commission and hearing examiner.
    2. Planning Commission. The role of the planning commission in administering the development code is governed by Chapter 3.46 MICC. In general, the planning commission is the designated planning agency for the city (see Chapter 35A.63 RCW). The planning commission makes recommendations to the city council on land use legislation, comprehensive plan amendments and quasi-judicial matters.
    3. Design Commission. The role of the design commission in administering the development code is governed by Chapter 3.34 MICC and MICC 19.15.220. In general, the design commission is responsible for maintaining the city’s design standards and acting on sign, commercial and multiple-family design applications.
    4. Community Planning and Development Department. The responsible officials in the community planning and development department act upon ministerial and administrative permits.
        a. The code official is responsible for administration, interpretation and enforcement of the development code.
        b. The building official is responsible for administration and interpretation of the building code, except for the International Fire Code.
        c. The city engineer is responsible for the administration and interpretation of engineering standards.
        d. The environmental official is responsible for the administration of the State Environmental Policy Act and the shoreline master program.
        e. The fire code official is responsible for administration and interpretation of the International Fire Code.
    5. Hearing Examiner. The role of the hearing examiner in administering the development code is governed by Chapter 3.40 MICC. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 17C-12 § 10; Ord. 13C-12 § 5; Ord. 11C-05 § 2; Ord. 11C-04 § 2; Ord. 10C-06 § 5; Ord. 10C-01 § 5; Ord. 08C-01 § 8; Ord. 06C-06 § 2; Ord. 06C-05 § 2; Ord. 05C-12 § 9; Ord. 04C-12 § 16; Ord. 04C-08 § 3; Ord. 03C-08 §§ 9, 10; Ord. 02C-04 § 5; Ord. 02C-01 § 6; Ord. 99C-13 § 1).

19.15.020 Legislative actions.
Legislative actions involve the creation, amendment or implementation of policy or law by ordinance. In contrast to the other types of actions, legislative actions apply to geographic areas and implement adopted city policy, promote the community interest, and are normally of interest to many property owners and citizens. Legislative actions are only adopted after an open record public hearing. Review procedures for legislative actions are located in MICC 19.15.260. Legislative actions include street vacations, comprehensive plan amendments, reclassification of property (rezones), and code amendments. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.15.030 Land use review types.
Code reviser’s note: This section has been amended by Ordinance No. 19C-02, an interim ordinance that is in effect until July 15, 2019. Ordinance No. 19-10 extended these provisions until January 14, 2020.
There are four categories of land use review that occur under the provisions of the development code.
A. Type I. Type I reviews are based on clear, objective and nondiscretionary standards or standards that require the application of professional expertise on technical issues.
B. Type II. Type II reviews are based on clear, objective and nondiscretionary standards or standards that require the application of professional expertise on technical issues. The difference between Type I and Type II review is that public notification shall be issued for Type II decisions.
C. Type III. Type III reviews require the exercise of discretion about nontechnical issues.
D. Type IV. Type IV reviews require discretion and may be actions of broad public interest. Decisions on Type IV reviews are only taken after an open record hearing.
E. The types of land use approvals are listed in Table A of this section. The required public process for each type of land use approval are listed in Table B of this section.
F. Consolidated Permit Processing. An application for a development proposal that involves the approval of two or more Type II, III and IV reviews may be processed and decided together, including any administrative appeals, using the highest numbered land use decision type applicable to the project application. The following permits and land use reviews are excluded from consolidated review and approval:
    1. Building permits associated with the construction of one or more new single-family dwellings on lots resulting from the final plat approval of a short subdivision or long subdivision.
    2. Building permits associated with shoreline conditional use permits and shoreline variance.
    3. Project SEPA reviews shall be processed as a Type III land use review.
    4. When a review is heard by multiple decision bodies, the higher decision body will make the final decision, and the lower decision body will review the project at a public meeting and issue a recommendation that will be reviewed by the higher decision body. The higher decision body will either adopt the recommendation as part of the permit conditions, will remand the recommendation back to the lower body for further consideration, will amend the recommendation, or will deny adoption of the recommendation and will adopt their own permit conditions. The hierarchy of decision bodies is as follows, from highest to lowest:
        a. City council;
        b. Hearing examiner;
        c. Design commission.

19.15.040 Review procedures.
The following are general requirements for processing a permit application under the development code. Additional or alternative requirements may exist for actions under specific code sections (see MICC 19.07.080, 19.07.110, 19.08.020, and 19.08.070). (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A). Formerly 19.15.020).

19.15.050 Preapplication.
A. Purpose. Meetings with the staff provide an opportunity to discuss the proposal in concept terms, identify the applicable city requirements and the project review process. Meetings or correspondence with the neighborhood to inform the neighborhood of the project proposal are encouraged prior to the formal notice provided by the city.
B. Optional Preapplication Meetings. Applicants for development proposals are encouraged to participate in informal meetings with city staff. Preapplication meetings may be held for any other development proposal at the request of the applicant.
C. Required Preapplication Meetings. Preapplication meetings are required for Type III and Type IV land use reviews. Preapplication meetings may be held for any other development proposal at the request of the applicant. This requirement may be waived by the code official.
D. Application. Applicants shall prepare a concept sketch of the development proposal for the preapplication meeting along with any other information specified by the code official in the preapplication meeting form.
E. Validity. Successful completion of a preapplication meeting does not constitute approval of any plan or design. Preapplication meetings shall occur within one year of application submittal, or after a code change affecting the application has occurred. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.15.060 Application.
A. The department shall not commence review of any application until the applicant has submitted the materials and fees specified for complete applications. An application shall contain all information deemed necessary by the code official to determine if the proposed permit or action will comply with the requirements of the applicable development regulations. The applicant for a development proposal shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed development complies with the applicable regulations and decision criteria. All land use applications shall include, at a minimum, the following:
    1. All applications for permits or land use reviews by the city shall be submitted on forms provided by the city;
    2. A site plan, prepared in a form prescribed by the code official;
    3. A completed SEPA environmental checklist, if required;
    4. Any studies or reports required for the processing of the application;
    5. A list of any permits or land use review types necessary for approval of the development proposal that have been obtained prior to filing the application or that are pending before the city or any other governmental entity;
    6. Drainage plans and documentation required by the Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington as adopted by Chapter 15.09 MICC, if applicable;
    7. Legal description of the site;
    8. Verification that the property affected by the application is in the exclusive ownership of the applicant, or that the applicant has a right to develop the site and that the application has been submitted with the consent of all owners of the affected property; provided, that compliance with subsection (A)(9) of this section shall satisfy the requirements of this subsection; 
    9. For Type II, III, and IV reviews, a title report from a reputable title company indicating that the applicant has either sole marketable title to the development site or has a publicly recorded right to develop the site (such as an easement). If the title report does not clearly indicate that the applicant has such rights, then the applicant shall include the written consent of the record holder(s) of the development site. The code official may waive this requirement if the title report will not substantively inform the review of the development proposal; and
    10. All applications for preliminary design review shall contain all information and materials deemed necessary by the code official to determine if the proposal complies with this chapter. Such materials may include a site survey; site plans; elevations; sections; architectural plans; roof plans; renderings and/or models; landscaping plan; parking plan; color and materials board; vicinity maps; site photographs; SEPA checklist; traffic study; pedestrian and vehicle circulation plans; and written narrative describing the project proposal and detailing how the project is meeting the applicable design objectives and standards established in Chapter 19.11 or 19.12 MICC. For new construction, submittal of lighting and sign master plans may be deferred to the public hearing if applicable.
B. A determination of completeness shall not preclude the code official from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of determination of completeness or subsequently if new or additional information is required or substantial changes in the proposed action occur, as determined by the code official.
C. All applications for permits or land use review by the city shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount established by city ordinance. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.15.070 Determination of completeness and letter of completion.

B. Determination of Completeness. Within 28 days after receiving an application for a Type III and Type IV land use review, the city shall mail, email, or provide in person a written letter of completion or letter of incompletion to the applicant, stating either that the application is complete or that the application is incomplete. If an application is incomplete, the letter of incompletion shall identify what additional documentation is necessary to result in a complete application. An application shall be deemed complete if the city does not provide a written determination to the applicant stating that the application is incomplete within 28 days after receiving an application.
C. Response to Letter of Incompletion. Within 14 days after an applicant has submitted all additional information identified as being necessary for a complete application, the city shall notify the applicant that the application is complete, or indicate that the application is incomplete and specify additional documentation as specified in subsection B of this section that is necessary to result in a complete application.
D. Completion Date. The date an application is determined complete is the date of receipt by the department of all of the information necessary to make the application complete as provided in this chapter. The department’s issuance of a letter of complete application, or the failure of the department to provide such a letter as directed by this section, shall cause an application to be conclusively deemed to be complete as provided in this section.
E. If the applicant fails to provide the required information within 90 days of the letter of incompletion, the application shall lapse. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A)).

Except as stated below, or as otherwise conditioned in the approval process, land use review approvals shall expire three years from the date of notice of decision if the development proposal authorized by the land use review is not commenced. For the purposes of this section, the development proposal shall be considered established if construction or substantial progress toward construction of a development proposal for which a land use review approval has been granted must be undertaken within two years of the date of notice of decision of the land use review. Where no construction activities are involved, the use or activity shall be commenced within three years of the date of notice of decision of the land use review.
B. Renewal. Renewal of expired land use approvals shall require a new application.
C. Long and Short Subdivisions. A final plat application meeting all requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the code official and recorded within five years of the date of preliminary plat approval.
D. Shoreline Land Use Reviews. The following time limits shall apply to all substantial development permits, shoreline conditional use permits and shoreline variance permits:
    1. Construction or substantial progress toward construction of a development for which a permit has been granted must be undertaken within two years of the effective date of a shoreline permit.

The effective date of a shoreline permit shall be the date of the last action required on the shoreline permit and all other government permits and approvals that authorize the development to proceed, including all administrative and legal actions on any such permit or approval.
    2. A single extension before the end of the time limit, with prior notice to parties of record, for up to one year, based on reasonable factors may be granted if a request for extension has been filed before the expiration date and notice of the proposed extension is given to parties of record and to the Department of Ecology.
E. Design Review.

    8. Previous implementation of the regulatory requirements governing the situation.
B. The code official may also bring any issue of interpretation before the planning commission for determination. Anyone in disagreement with an interpretation by the code official may also appeal the code official’s interpretation to the hearing examiner. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A)).

19.15.170 Vesting.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify certain points in the land use approval process at which an applicant’s rights become “vested.” “Vested rights” is defined as the guarantee that an application will be reviewed and a development proposal can be developed (if a permit is issued) under regulations and procedures existing at one moment in time and regardless of changes that may have been made later and prior to final completion of a project or use.
B. Vesting for Land Use Reviews. Complete applications for land use review of Type I land use reviews, building permits, conditional use permits, design review, short subdivisions and long subdivisions, shall vest on the date a complete application is filed. The department’s issuance of a letter of completion for Type III and IV land use decisions, as provided in this chapter, or the failure of the department to provide such a letter as provided in this chapter, shall cause an application to be conclusively deemed to be vested as provided herein.
C. Scope of Vested Rights. 
    1. Land use reviews that are subject to the provisions of this section shall be considered under the zoning and land use control ordinances (MICC Titles 15 and 19) in effect on the date of complete application. Supplemental information and revisions to a development proposal design required by the city after vesting of a complete application shall not affect the validity of the vesting for such application.
    2. An applicant must specifically identify a proposed land use or uses in the land use review application as the intended use of the development proposal site in order to vest the right to engage in a specific land use against an ordinance implementing a change in permitted land uses.
    3. An application for a land use review may be denied or approved with conditions under the authority of the city to protect and enhance the public safety, health and welfare, and under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and the city of Mercer Island’s SEPA regulations and policies as of the date of vesting, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has attained a vested right against enforcement of an ordinance implementing changes in regulations, codes or procedures affecting that land use review application.
D. Termination of Vested Rights. 
    1. Termination of vested rights associated with a land use review for a development proposal shall occur at the time of expiration of land use review approval, as established in MICC 19.15.150, or when an applicant withdraws the land use application.
    2. Applicant-generated modifications or requests for revision(s) to building permits, short subdivision, or long subdivisions which are not made in response to staff review, public process, appeal, or conditions of approval, and which result in substantial changes to a development proposal design, which includes but is not limited to the creation of additional lots, substantial change in access, substantial changes in project design, or additional impacts to critical areas shall be treated as new applications for purposes of vesting.

19.15.230 Comprehensive plan amendments.
A. Purpose. The Growth Management Act (GMA), Chapter 36.70A RCW, requires that the city include within its development regulations a procedure for any interested person to suggest plan amendments. The suggested amendments will be docketed for consideration. The purpose of this section is to establish a procedure for amending the city’s comprehensive plan text and maps. Amendments to the comprehensive plan are the means by which the city may modify its 20-year plan for land use, development or growth policies in response to changing city needs or circumstances. All plan amendments will be reviewed in accordance with the GMA and other applicable state laws, the countywide planning policies, the adopted city of Mercer Island comprehensive plan, and applicable capital facilities plans.
B. Application Requirements. Proposed amendment requests may be submitted by the public, city manager, city department directors or by majority vote of the city council, planning commission or other city board or commission. Proposed amendments submitted by the public shall be accompanied by application forms required by this title and by the code official and the filing fees established by resolution. All application forms for amendments to the comprehensive plan shall include a detailed description of the proposed amendment in nontechnical terms.
C. Frequency of Amendments. 
    1. Periodic Review. The comprehensive plan shall be subject to continuing review and evaluation by the city (“periodic review”). The city shall take legislative action to review and, if needed, revise its comprehensive plan to ensure the plan complies with the requirements of the GMA according to the deadlines established in RCW 36.70A.130.
    2. Annual Amendment Cycle. Updates, proposed amendments, or revisions to the comprehensive plan may be considered by the city council no more frequently than once every calendar year as established in this section (the “annual amendment cycle”). During a year when periodic review of the comprehensive plan is required under RCW 36.70A.130, the annual amendment cycle and the periodic review shall be combined.
    3. More frequent amendments may be allowed under the circumstances set forth within RCW 36.70A.130(2). Amendments processed outside of the annual amendment cycle under RCW 36.70A.130(2) may be initiated by action of the city council. The city council shall specify the scope of the amendment, identify the projected completion date, and identify and, if necessary, fund resources necessary to accomplish the work. Amendments allowed to be processed outside of the annual amendment cycle are not subject to the docketing process outlined within subsection D of this section.
D. Docketing of Proposed Amendments. For purpose of this section, docketing refers to compiling and maintaining a list of suggested changes to the comprehensive plan in a manner that will ensure such suggested changes will be considered by the city and will be available for review by the public. The following process will be used to create the docket:
    1. Preliminary Docket Review. By September 1, the city will issue notice of the annual comprehensive plan amendment cycle for the following calendar year. The amendment request deadline is October 1. Proposed amendment requests received after October 1 will not be considered for the following year’s comprehensive plan amendment process but will be held for the next eligible comprehensive plan amendment process.
        a. The code official shall compile and maintain for public review a list of suggested amendments and identified deficiencies as received throughout the year.
        b. The code official shall review all complete and timely filed applications proposing amendments to the comprehensive plan and place these applications on the preliminary docket along with other city-initiated amendments to the comprehensive plan.
        c. The planning commission shall review the preliminary docket at a public meeting and make a recommendation on the preliminary docket to the city council each year.
        d. The city council shall review the preliminary docket at a public meeting. By December 31, the city council shall establish the final docket based on the criteria in subsection E of this section. Once approved, the final docket defines the work plan and resource needs for the following year’s comprehensive plan amendments.
    2. Final Docket Review. 
        a. Placement on the final docket does not mean a proposed amendment will be approved. The purpose of the final docket is to allow for further analysis and consideration by the city.
        b. All items on the final docket shall be considered concurrently so that the cumulative effect of the various proposals can be ascertained. Proposed amendments may be considered at separate meetings or hearings, so long as the final action taken considers the cumulative effect of all proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan.
        c. The code official shall review and assess the items placed on the final docket and prepare recommendations for each proposed amendment. The code official shall be responsible for developing an environmental review of the combined impacts of all proposed amendments on the final docket, except that applicants seeking a site-specific amendment shall be responsible for submittal of a SEPA environmental checklist and supporting information. The applicant will need to submit SEPA and any other accompanying legislative actions such as a rezone or a code amendment at this time. The code official may require an applicant to pay for peer review and/or additional resources needed to review the proposal. The code official shall set a date for consideration of the final docket by the planning commission and timely transmit the staff recommendation prior to the scheduled date.
        d. The planning commission shall review the proposed amendments contained in the final docket based on the criteria set forth in subsection (F)(1) of this section. The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed amendments. The planning commission shall make a recommendation on the proposed amendments and transmit the recommendation to the city council.
        e. After issuance of the planning commission’s recommendation, the code official shall set a date for consideration of the final docket by the city council. The city council shall review the proposed amendments taking into consideration the recommendations of the planning commission and code official. The city council may deny, approve, or modify the planning commission’s recommendations consistent with the criteria set forth in subsection (F)(1) of this section. The city council’s establishment of a final docket of proposed amendments is not appealable.
        f. The planning commission and the city council may hold additional public hearings, meetings, or workshops as warranted by the proposed amendments.
E. Docketing Criteria. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether a proposed amendment is added to the final docket in subsection D of this section:
    1. The request has been filed in a timely manner, and either:
        a. State law requires, or a decision of a court or administrative agency has directed, such a change; or
        b. All of the following criteria are met:
            i. The proposed amendment presents a matter appropriately addressed through the comprehensive plan;
            ii. The city can provide the resources, including staff and budget, necessary to review the proposal, or resources can be provided by an applicant for an amendment;
            iii. The proposal does not raise policy or land use issues that are more appropriately addressed by an ongoing work program item approved by the city council;
            iv. The proposal will serve the public interest by implementing specifically identified goals of the comprehensive plan or a new approach supporting the city’s vision; and
            v. The essential elements of the proposal and proposed outcome have not been considered by the city council in the last three years. This time limit may be waived by the city council if the proponent establishes that there exists a change in circumstances that justifies the need for the amendment.
F. Decision Criteria. Decisions to amend the comprehensive plan shall be based on the criteria specified below. An applicant for a comprehensive plan amendment proposal shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed amendment complies with the applicable regulations and decision criteria.
    1. The amendment is consistent with the Growth Management Act, the countywide planning policies, and the other provisions of the comprehensive plan and city policies; and:
        a. There exists obvious technical error in the information contained in the comprehensive plan; or
        b. The amendment addresses changing circumstances of the city as a whole.
    2. If the amendment is directed at a specific property, the following additional findings shall be determined:
        a. The amendment is compatible with the adjacent land use and development pattern;
        b. The property is suitable for development in conformance with the standards under the potential zoning; and
        c. The amendment will benefit the community as a whole and will not adversely affect community facilities or the public health, safety, and general welfare.

H. Expansion of Land Use Map Amendment. The city may propose to expand the geographic scope of an amendment to the comprehensive plan land use map to allow for consideration of adjacent property, similarly situated property, or area-wide impacts. The following criteria shall be used in determining whether to expand the geographic scope of a proposed land use map amendment:
    1. The effect of the proposed amendment on the surrounding area or city;
    2. The effect of the proposed amendment on the land use and circulation pattern of the surrounding area or city; and
    3. The effect of the proposed amendment on the future development of the surrounding area or city.
I. Implementation of Comprehensive Plan Amendments. It is the city’s intent to comply with the Growth Management Act (Chapter 36.70A RCW) and the guidelines for implementation of comprehensive plan goals and policies contained in Chapter 365-196 WAC. It is also the city’s intent to allow sufficient time for review of regulations or programs that are intended to implement new or significantly amended policy direction within the comprehensive plan.
    1. Where amendments to existing comprehensive plan goals and policies represent an adjustment to an existing policy direction, the city should generally prepare, review, and adopt implementing development regulations or programs concurrently with the adoption of the amendments to the comprehensive plan.
    2. Where amendments to existing comprehensive plan goals and policies represent a new policy direction, or a significant amendment to the current policy direction within the comprehensive plan, the city should prepare, review, and adopt implementing development regulations or programs as soon as reasonably practicable following the adoption of the amendments to the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 18C-08 § 1 (Att. A); Ord. 16C-13 § 2. Formerly 19.15.050).

The elevation in the R-8.4, R-9.6, R-12, and R-15 zoning designations is established by averaging the elevation at existing grade or finished grade, whichever is lower (MICC 19.02.020(E)(4)). The elevation in the PI zoning designation is established by averaging the elevation at existing grade. The elevation points to be averaged shall be located at the center of all exterior walls of the completed building; provided:
    1. Roof overhangs and eaves, chimneys and fireplaces, unenclosed projecting wall elements (columns and fin walls), unenclosed and unroofed stairs, and porches, decks and terraces may project outside exterior walls and are not to be considered as walls.
    2. If the building is circular in shape, four points, 90 degrees apart, at the exterior walls, shall be used to calculate the average building elevation.
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Formula: | Average Building Elevation = (Weighted Sum of the Mid-point        |
    |          | Elevations) ÷ (Total Length of Wall Segments)                      |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Where:   | Weighted Sum of the Mid-point Elevations = The sum of: ((Mid-point |
    |          | Elevation of Each Individual Wall Segment) x (Length of Each       |
    |          | Individual Wall Segment))                                          |
    +----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
For example for a house with 10 wall segments:
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (Axa) + (Bxb) + (Cxc) + (Dxd) + (Exe) + (Fxf) + (Gxg) + (Hxh) + (Ixi) + (Jxj) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Where: | A, B, C, D… = The existing or finished ground elevation, whichever |
|        | is lower, at midpoint of wall segment.                             |
+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| And:   | a, b, c, d… = The length of wall segment measured on outside       |
|        | of wall.                                                           |

For all other lots, lot depth is determined by the mean average distance measured from the front lot line to the rear lot line. To calculate mean average distance, draw lines perpendicular to the front property line at two-foot intervals. The lengths of the perpendicular lines, which extend through the building pad to the rear lot line, shall be added together and the sum of the lengths shall be divided by the total number of perpendicular lines.

Lot, Nonconforming: See Nonconforming Lot.
Lot Width: For lots with exactly one front lot line, one rear lot line, and two side lot lines, lot width is the distance between the two midpoints of side lot lines. For all other lots, lot width is determined by a lot width circle within the boundaries of the lot; provided, that no access easements are included within the lot width circle.
Lots, Contiguous: Contiguous lots are two or more lots that share a common property line; provided, the existence of a public or private roadway, utility and/or similar easement shall not be deemed to divide or make land noncontiguous if land on both sides of such roadway, utility and/or similar easement is commonly owned or controlled.

R
Reasonable Best Efforts: In cases where the code requires “reasonable best efforts” to comply with standards, the burden of proving that reasonable best efforts have been taken, and compliance is infeasible, is on the applicant. In determining whether reasonable best efforts have been taken the code official may weigh the applicant’s actions to comply with the applicable standard and the action’s relative costs to the applicant and public benefits, considered in the short- and long-term time frames. The code official may also evaluate whether an applicant’s prior actions have contributed to the applicant’s inability to comply with the applicable standard.
Reasonable Use: A legal concept that has been and will be articulated by federal and state courts in regulatory takings and substantive due process cases. The decisionmaker must balance the public’s interests against the owner’s interests by considering the nature of the harm the regulation is intended to prevent, the availability and effectiveness of alternative measures, the reasonable use of the property remaining to the owner and the economic loss borne by the owner. Public interest factors include the seriousness of the public problem, the extent to which the land involved contributes to the problem, the degree to which the regulation solves the problem, and the feasibility of less oppressive solutions. A reasonable use exception set forth in MICC 19.07.030(B) balances the public interests against the regulation being unduly oppressive to the property owner.

Security shall be made to and held by the District, which will be responsible for tracking and documenting the security interest.
C. The fee amount established in the schedule shall be reduced by the amount of any payment previously made for the lot or development activity in question, either as a condition of approval or pursuant to a voluntary agreement.
D. Whenever a developer is granted approval subject to a condition that the developer provide a school facility acceptable to the District, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for the actual cost of providing the facility, against the fee that would be chargeable under the formula provided by this chapter. The cost of construction shall be estimated at the time of approval, but must be documented, and the documentation confirmed after the construction is completed to assure that an accurate credit amount is provided. If construction costs are less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as a school impact fee.
E. The standard impact fees may be adjusted, if one of the following circumstances exist, provided that any discount set forth in the fee formula fails to adjust for the error in the calculation or fails to ameliorate for the unfairness of the fee:
    1. The developer demonstrates that an impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or
    2. Unusual circumstances identified by the developer demonstrate that if the standard impact fee amount was applied to the development, it would be unfair or unjust.
F. In cases where a developer requests an independent fee calculation, adjustment exception or a credit pursuant to RCW 82.02.060(3), the city shall consult with the District and the District shall advise the city prior to the city making the final impact fee determination.
G. A developer may provide studies and data to demonstrate that any particular factor used by the District may not be appropriately applied to the development proposal.
H. Any appeal of the decision of the city with regard to fee amounts shall follow the process for the appeal of the underlying development application, as set forth in the Mercer Island City Code. Any errors in the formula identified as a result of the appeal should be referred to the council for possible modification.
I. Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a permit or other approval of development activity. (Ord. 15C-15 § 1).

19.17.110 Impact fee accounts and refunds.
A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the District solely for the District’s school impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the District shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees. The District shall submit a copy of this report to the city.
B. Impact fees for the District’s system improvements shall be expended by the District for capital improvements including but not limited to school planning, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, relocatable facilities, capital equipment pertaining to educational facilities, and any other expenses which could be capitalized, and which are consistent with the District’s capital facilities plan.
C. Impact fees may be used to recoup costs for system improvements previously incurred by the District to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed system improvements.
D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.
E. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the District for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the District, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified to the city by the District in a written report. The city council shall identify the District’s extraordinary and compelling reasons for the fees to be held longer than 10 years in the council’s own written findings.
F. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt of the funds by the District on school facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The District shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records.
G. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the District in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the District in conformance with the capital facilities plan within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.
H. Should the city seek to terminate any or all school impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a school impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the District, but must be expended by the District, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.
I. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:
    1. The developer has not received final plat approval, the building permit, the mobile home permit, the site plan approval, nor final approval for the development activity as required by statute or city code including the International Building Code; and
    2. No impact on the District has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the District has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the District has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the District and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The District shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in MICC 19.17.100.
J. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the District on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 15C-15 § 1).

19.18.020 Definitions.
A. “Affordable housing unit” means (1) an owner-occupied housing unit affordable to households whose household income is less than 80 percent of the King County median income, adjusted for household size, as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and no more than 30 percent of the household income is paid for housing expenses (e.g., mortgage, property taxes, hazard and mortgage insurance and homeowners dues (if applicable), or (2) a renter-occupied housing unit affordable to households whose income is less than 60 percent of the King County median income, adjusted for household size, as determined by HUD, and no more than 30 percent of the household income is paid for housing expenses (rent and appropriate utility allowance). In the event that HUD no longer publishes median income figures for King County, the city may use another method as it may choose to determine the King County median income, adjusted for household size. The code official will make a determination of sales prices or rents that meet the affordability requirements of this chapter.
B. “Capital facilities plan” means the capital facilities element of the city of Mercer Island’s comprehensive plan.
C. “City” means the city of Mercer Island.
D. “Developer” means the person or entity that owns or holds purchase options or other development control over property for which development activity is proposed.
E. “Development activity” means having any residential construction or expansion of a residential building, structure or use, any change in use of a residential building or structure, or any change in the use of residential land that creates additional demand for park facilities.
F. “Dwelling unit” means a dwelling as defined in MICC 19.16.010. For purposes of this chapter, an accessory dwelling unit as regulated in MICC 19.02.030 is considered an adjunct to the associated primary structure and is not charged a separate impact fee.

A. The fee shall be calculated based on the methodology set forth in the parks impact fee rate study.
B. Any impact fee imposed shall be reasonably related to the impact caused by the development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the costs of system improvements that are reasonably related to the new development. The impact fee formula shall take into account the future revenues the city will receive from the development, along with system costs related to serving the new development.
C. For the purpose of this chapter, mobile homes shall be treated as single-family dwellings and duplexes shall be treated as multifamily dwellings.
D. The methodology shall provide for a credit for park facilities or sites actually provided by a developer which the city finds acceptable. (Ord. 15C-22 § 1).

19.18.050 Assessment and collection of impact fees.
A. The city shall collect impact fees, based on the city’s permit and impact fee schedule, from any applicant seeking a residential building permit from the city.
B. All impact fees shall be collected from the applicant prior to issuance of the building permit unless the use of an independent fee calculation has been approved or unless the applicant applies for deferred payment of impact fees pursuant to MICC 19.18.060.

The credit shall apply to the first complete building permit application submitted to the city subsequent to demolition of the existing dwelling unit, unless otherwise allocated by the applicant of the subdivision as part of approval of the subdivision.
E. The city shall not issue the required building permit unless and until the impact fees set forth in the impact fee schedule have been paid.
F. The city may impose an application fee, as provided for in the city’s adopted permit and impact fee schedule, to cover the reasonable cost of administration of the impact fee program.

19.18.060 Option for deferred payment of impact fees.
An applicant may request, at any time prior to building permit issuance, and consistent with the requirements of this section, to defer to final inspection the payment of an impact fee for a residential development unit. The following shall apply to any request to defer payment of an impact fee:
A. The applicant shall submit to the city a written request to defer the payment of an impact fee for a specifically identified building permit. The applicant’s request shall identify, as applicable, the applicant’s corporate identity and contractor registration number, the full names of all legal owners of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur, the legal description of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur, the tax parcel identification number of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur, and the address of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur. All applications shall be accompanied by an administrative fee as provided for in the city’s adopted permit and impact fee schedule.
B. The impact fee amount due under any request to defer payment of impact fees shall be based on the schedule in effect at the time the applicant provides the city with the information required in subsection A of this section.

The deferred impact fee payment lien shall be recorded against the property subject to the building permit and be granted in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee. Any such lien shall be junior and subordinate only to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property subject to the building permit. In addition to the administrative fee required in subsection A of this section, the applicant shall pay to the city the fees necessary for recording the lien agreement with the King County recorder.

19.18.070 Exemptions.
The following development activities are exempt or partially exempt from the payment of park impact fees:
A. Reconstruction, remodeling or construction of any form of affordable (low-income) housing units, as defined in this chapter, may request an exemption of 80 percent of the required impact fee. Any claim for an exemption for affordable housing units must be made prior to payment of the impact fee, and any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.

B. Rebuilding of legally established building(s) destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, act of God or other accident or catastrophe, or remodeling of existing legally established building(s), or replacing demolished legally established building(s); provided, that a complete building permit for construction or reconstruction is submitted to the city within 12 months of the date of the loss or demolition, as the case may be, and so long as no additional dwelling units are created.
C. Condominium projects in which existing dwelling units are converted into condominium ownership and where no new dwelling units are created.
D. Any development activity that is exempt from the payment of an impact fee pursuant to RCW 82.02.100, due to mitigation of the same system improvement under the State Environmental Policy Act.
E. Any development activity for which park impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a condition of plat approval to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve park facilities, unless the condition of the plat approval provides otherwise; and further provided, that the condition of the plat approval predates the effective date of fee imposition.
F. Any development activity for which park impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a voluntary agreement entered into with the city to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve park facilities, unless the terms of the voluntary agreement provide otherwise; and further provided, that the agreement predates the effective date of fee imposition. (Ord. 15C-22 § 1).

19.18.080 Determination of the fee, adjustments, exceptions and appeals.
A. The city shall determine a developer’s impact fee, according to the impact fee schedule.
B. The fee amount established in the schedule shall be reduced by the amount of any payment previously made for the lot or development activity in question, either as a condition of approval or pursuant to a voluntary agreement.
C. Whenever a developer is granted approval subject to a condition that the developer provide a park facility acceptable to the city, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for the actual cost of providing the facility, against the fee that would be chargeable under the formula provided by this chapter. The cost of construction shall be estimated at the time of approval, but must be documented, and the documentation confirmed after the construction is completed to assure that an accurate credit amount is provided. If construction costs are less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as a park impact fee.
D. The standard impact fees may be adjusted, if one of the following circumstances exist; provided, that any discount set forth in the fee formula fails to adjust for the error in the calculation or fails to ameliorate for the unfairness of the fee:
    1. The developer demonstrates that an impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or
    2. Unusual circumstances identified by the developer demonstrate that if the standard impact fee amount was applied to the development, it would be unfair or unjust.

19.18.090 Impact fee accounts and refunds.
A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest bearing account established by the city solely for the city’s park impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the city shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.
B. Impact fees for park system improvements shall be expended by the city for capital improvements including but not limited to park planning, land surveys, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, capital equipment pertaining to recreational facilities, and any other expenses which could be capitalized, and which are consistent with the city’s capital facilities element of its comprehensive plan or the city’s comprehensive parks and recreation plan.
C. Impact fees may be used to recoup costs for system improvements previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed system improvements.
D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.
E. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the city for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the city, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years.
F. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt of the funds by the city on park facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The city shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records.
G. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the city in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the city in conformance with the capital facilities element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.
H. Should the city seek to terminate any or all park impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a park impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended by the city, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.
I. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:
    1. The developer has not received final plat approval, the building permit, the mobile home permit, the site plan approval, nor final approval for the development activity as required by statute or city code including the International Building Code; and
    2. No impact on the city has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the city has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the city has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the city and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The city shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in MICC 19.18.080.
J. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the city on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 15C-22 § 1).

19.18.100 Fee schedule and updates.

    1. Single-family dwelling unit: $2,054 per dwelling unit.
    2. Multifamily: $1,320 per dwelling unit.
B. Park impact fee rates shall be updated annually using the following procedures:
    1. The code official shall use the Construction Cost Index for Seattle (June-June) published by the Engineering News-Record to calculate annual inflation adjustments in the impact fee rates. The park impact fees shall not be adjusted for inflation should the index remain unchanged.
    2. The indexed impact fee rates shall be effective January 1. A copy of the indexed impact fee rates shall be provided to the city council but the indexed rates shall become effective without further council review.
C. The code official shall review the park impact fee rates annually to determine when a new park impact fee rate study should be prepared and recommend to the city council when a new study should be prepared. (Ord. 15C-22 § 1).

B. Any impact fee imposed shall be reasonably related to the impact caused by the development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements that are reasonably related to the new development. The impact fee formula shall take into account the future revenues the city will receive from the development, along with system costs related to serving the new development.
C. For the purpose of this chapter, mobile homes shall be treated as single-family dwellings and duplexes shall be treated as multifamily dwellings.
D. The methodology shall provide for a credit for transportation facilities or sites actually provided by a developer which the city finds acceptable. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.19.050 Assessment and collection of impact fees.
A. The city shall collect impact fees, based on the city’s permit and impact fee schedule, from any applicant seeking a building permit from the city.
B. All impact fees shall be collected from the applicant prior to issuance of the building permit unless the use of an independent fee calculation has been approved or unless the applicant applies for deferred payment of impact fees pursuant to MICC 19.19.060. The fee shall be calculated based on the impact fee schedule in effect at the time the building permit is issued unless otherwise required pursuant to MICC 19.19.060.
C. For building permits within new subdivisions approved under Chapter 19.08 MICC (Subdivisions), a credit shall be applied for any dwelling unit that exists on the land within the subdivision prior to the subdivision if the dwelling unit is demolished. The credit shall apply to the first complete building permit application submitted to the city subsequent to demolition of the existing dwelling unit, unless otherwise allocated by the applicant of the subdivision as part of approval of the subdivision.
D. The city shall not issue the required building permit unless and until the impact fees set forth in the impact fee schedule have been paid.
E. The city may impose an application fee, as provided for in the city’s adopted permit and impact fee schedule, to cover the reasonable cost of administration of the impact fee program. The fee is not refundable and is collected from the applicant of the development activity permit at the time of permit issuance. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.19.060 Option for deferred payment of impact fees.
An applicant may request, at any time prior to building permit issuance, and consistent with the requirements of this section, to defer to final inspection the payment of an impact fee for a residential development unit. The following shall apply to any request to defer payment of an impact fee:
A. The applicant shall submit to the city a written request to defer the payment of an impact fee for a specifically identified building permit. The applicant’s request shall identify, as applicable, the applicant’s corporate identity and contractor registration number, the full names of all legal owners of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur, the legal description of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur, the tax parcel identification number of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur, and the address of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur. All applications shall be accompanied by an administrative fee as provided for in the city’s adopted permit and impact fee schedule.
B. The impact fee amount due under any request to defer payment of impact fees shall be based on the schedule in effect at the time the applicant provides the city with the information required in subsection A of this section.
C. Prior to the issuance of a building permit that is the subject of a request for a deferred payment of impact fee, all applicants and/or legal owners of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the building permit is to occur must sign a deferred impact fee payment lien in a form acceptable to the city attorney. The deferred impact fee payment lien shall be recorded against the property subject to the building permit and be granted in favor of the city in the amount of the deferred impact fee. Any such lien shall be junior and subordinate only to one mortgage for the purpose of construction upon the same real property subject to the building permit. In addition to the administrative fee required in subsection A of this section, the applicant shall pay to the city the fees necessary for recording the lien agreement with the King County recorder.
D. The city shall not approve a final inspection until the transportation impact fees identified in the deferred impact fee payment lien are paid in full.
E. In no case shall payment of the impact fee be deferred for a period of more than 18 months from the date of building permit issuance.
F. Upon receipt of final payment of the deferred impact fee as identified in the deferred impact fee payment lien, the city shall execute a release of lien for the property. The property owner may, at his or her own expense, record the lien release.
G. In the event that the deferred impact fee is not paid within the time provided in this subsection, the city shall institute foreclosure proceedings under the process set forth in Chapter 61.12 RCW.
H. An applicant is entitled to defer impact fees pursuant to this section for no more than 20 single-family dwelling unit building permits per year in the city. For purposes of this section, an “applicant” includes an entity that controls the applicant, is controlled by the applicant, or is under common control with the applicant. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.19.070 Exemptions.
The following development activity is exempt or partially exempt from the payment of transportation impact fees:
A. Reconstruction, remodeling or construction of any form of affordable (low-income) housing units, as defined in this chapter, may request an exemption of 80 percent of the required impact fee. Any claim for an exemption for affordable housing units must be made prior to payment of the impact fee, and any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. Prior to any development approval, the owner shall execute and record against the property in the King County real property title records a city-prepared covenant that shall guarantee that the affordable housing shall continue, which covenant shall run with the land, address annual reporting requirements to the city, price restrictions and household income limits and be consistent with the provisions of RCW 82.02.060(3) as now adopted or hereafter amended. In the event that the exempt housing unit is no longer used for affordable (low-income) housing as defined in this chapter, the current owner shall pay the applicable impact fees in effect at the time of conversion.
B. Rebuilding of legally established building(s) destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, act of God or other accident or catastrophe, or remodeling of existing legally established building(s), or replacing demolished legally established building(s); provided, that a complete building permit for construction or reconstruction is submitted to the city within 12 months of the date of the loss or demolition, as the case may be, and so long as no additional dwelling units are created or change of use from one category on the impact fee schedule to another category on the impact fee schedule occurs. If such change of use occurs, the impact fee will be calculated based on the impact fee of the new use minus the impact fee of the prior use, based on the rates in the impact fee schedule pursuant to MICC 19.19.050.
C. Condominium projects in which existing dwelling units are converted into condominium ownership and where no new dwelling units are created.
D. Any development activity that is exempt from the payment of an impact fee pursuant to RCW 82.02.100, due to mitigation of the same system improvement under the State Environmental Policy Act.
E. Any development activity for which transportation impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a condition of plat approval to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve transportation facilities, unless the condition of the plat approval provides otherwise; and further provided, that the condition of the plat approval predates the effective date of fee imposition.
F. Any development activity for which transportation impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a voluntary agreement entered into with the city to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve transportation facilities, unless the terms of the voluntary agreement provide otherwise; and further provided, that the agreement predates the effective date of fee imposition.
G. Retail and restaurant uses as defined in Chapter 19.16 MICC. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.19.080 Determination of the fee, adjustments, exceptions and appeals.
A. The city shall determine a developer’s impact fee, according to the impact fee schedule.
B. The fee amount established in the schedule shall be reduced by the amount of any payment previously made for the lot or development activity in question, either as a condition of approval or pursuant to a voluntary agreement.
C. Whenever a developer is granted approval subject to a condition that the developer provide a transportation facility acceptable to the city, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for the actual cost of providing the facility, against the fee that would be chargeable under the formula provided by this chapter. The cost of construction shall be estimated at the time of approval, but must be documented, and the documentation confirmed after the construction is completed to assure that an accurate credit amount is provided. If construction costs are less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as a transportation impact fee.
D. The standard impact fees may be adjusted, if one of the following circumstances exist; provided, that any discount set forth in the fee formula fails to adjust for the error in the calculation or fails to ameliorate for the unfairness of the fee:
    1. The developer demonstrates that an impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or
    2. Unusual circumstances identified by the developer demonstrate that if the standard impact fee amount was applied to the development, it would be unfair or unjust.
E. A developer may provide studies and data to demonstrate that any particular factor used by the city may not be appropriately applied to the development proposal.
F. Any appeal of the decision of the city with regard to fee amounts shall follow the process for the appeal of the underlying development application, as set forth in the Mercer Island City Code. Any errors in the formula identified as a result of the appeal should be referred to the council for possible modification.
G. Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a permit or other approval of development activity. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.19.090 Impact fee accounts and refunds.
A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the city solely for the city’s transportation impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the city shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.
B. Impact fees for transportation system improvements shall be expended by the city for capital improvements including but not limited to transportation planning, land surveys, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, and any other expenses which could be capitalized, and which are consistent with the city’s capital facilities element of its comprehensive plan or the city’s six-year transportation improvement program.
C. Impact fees may be used to recoup costs for system improvements previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed system improvements.
D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended and where consistent with the bond covenants, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section.
E. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the city for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the city, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than 10 years.
F. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within 10 years of receipt of the funds by the city on transportation facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. In determining whether impact fees have been encumbered, impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis. The city shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records.
G. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the city in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the city in conformance with the capital facilities element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.
H. Should the city seek to terminate any or all transportation impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a transportation impact fee was paid. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended by the city, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.
I. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:
    1. The developer has not received final plat approval, the building permit, the mobile home permit, the site plan approval, nor final approval for the development activity as required by statute or city code including the International Building Code; and
    2. No impact on the city has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the city has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the city has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if, within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the city and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The city shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in MICC 19.19.080.
J. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the city on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.19.100 Fee schedule, review of schedule and updates.
A. The impact fees on Exhibit A to the ordinance codified in this chapter are based on the city’s 2015 rate study.
B. Transportation impact fee rates shall be updated annually using the following procedures:
    1. The code official shall use the Construction Cost Index for Seattle (June-June) published by the Engineering News Record to calculate annual inflation adjustments in the impact fee rates. The transportation impact fees shall not be adjusted for inflation should the index remain unchanged.
    2. The indexed impact fee rates shall be effective January 1. A copy of the indexed impact fee rates shall be provided to the city council but the indexed rates shall become effective without further council review.
C. The code official shall review the transportation impact fee rates annually to determine when a new transportation impact fee rate study should be prepared and recommend to the city council when a new study should be prepared. (Ord. 16C-01 § 1).

19.20.010 Purpose and authority.
A. This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city’s police powers, the State Growth Management Act (GMA) as codified in Chapter 36.70A RCW and the concurrency regulations as codified in WAC 365-196-840.
B. The purpose of this chapter is to:
    1. Comply with the GMA by prohibiting approval of development proposals if the development causes the level of service on a transportation facility to decline below the standards adopted in the transportation element of the Mercer Island comprehensive plan, unless transportation improvements or strategies to accommodate the impacts of development are made concurrent with the development. For the purposes of the city’s concurrency requirement, “concurrent with the development” shall mean that improvements or strategies are in place at the time of development, or that a financial commitment is in place to complete the improvements or strategies within six years.
    2. Establish a system to evaluate development proposals to ensure that adequate transportation facilities are provided concurrently with development, as defined by the GMA. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.020 Transportation concurrency application and certificate required.
A transportation concurrency application and transportation concurrency certificate are required for any development proposal specified in MICC 19.20.030 or any development that will otherwise result in the creation of one or more net new trips in the morning peak hour or evening peak hour. No development shall be required to obtain more than one transportation concurrency certificate, unless the applicant or subsequent owners propose changes or modifications that require a new development permit application or result in increased net new trips, a future phase of the project requires a transportation concurrency application, or the original transportation concurrency certificate has expired. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.030 Transportation concurrency review.
The following describes the steps in obtaining a transportation concurrency certificate:
A. Application. A transportation concurrency application and traffic impact analysis (if required) shall be submitted prior to, or concurrent with, an application for the following development proposals:
    1. Preliminary long plat or preliminary short plat and revisions or alterations thereof which will increase the number of dwelling units or net new trips;
    2. Development agreements;
    3. Design review or conditional use permit; or
    4. Any other land use approval or building permit that will result in net new trips, unless a certificate has been issued for the same development proposal in conjunction with subsection (A)(1), (A)(2), or (A)(3) of this section.
B. Contents of Application. Transportation concurrency applications shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the code official. Applicants for a certificate of concurrency shall designate the density and intensity of development to be tested for concurrency, provided such density and intensity shall not exceed the maximum allowed for the development proposal site. The concurrency test and resulting concurrency certificate will be based on and applicable to only the applicant’s designated density and intensity, and the resulting net new trips, calculated pursuant to subsection E of this section.
C. The transportation concurrency application shall accompany the first application for land use approval or building permit. Transportation concurrency applications, once determined complete and following receipt of any required fees, shall be reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis.
D. Traffic Impact Analysis. A traffic impact analysis complying with the city’s traffic impact analysis guidelines is required for any development proposal that generates 10 or more net new vehicle trips during the morning or evening peak hour.
E. Determine Number of Net New Trips. The code official shall review the transportation concurrency application to determine the number of net new trips generated by the development proposal using the most current edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. Applicants may be required to provide supplemental information regarding the number of vehicle trips created by the prior use and/or for their specific development if the number of vehicle trips created is not clearly addressed in the most current edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual. In determining the net new trips, no credit shall be given for vehicle trip ends from sites/structures that have been vacant for more than one year or for trips from any unpermitted or illegal development. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.040 Transportation concurrency certificate – Approval.
A. Approval. A transportation concurrency certificate shall be approved if net new trips from the development proposal do not cause the level of service at a concurrency intersection to decline below the standards adopted in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan. The level of service analysis shall include the net new trips for all developments that have been previously approved for concurrency.
B. Contents. A transportation concurrency certificate shall include, as a minimum:
    1. The location or other description of the development proposal site.
    2. The type of development proposal for which the transportation concurrency certificate is issued.
    3. The specific use, densities, and intensities that were tested for transportation concurrency and which are authorized for development of the property.
    4. The net new trips assigned to the development as described in the certificate.
    5. Conditions of approval, if applicable.
    6. An effective date.
    7. An expiration date.
C. Reservation of Capacity. The city shall reserve capacity to accommodate the net new trips from any development proposal receiving a concurrency certificate. Reserved capacity shall not be returned to the system unless and until an associated development permit application is denied, rejected, invalidated or abandoned, or the transportation concurrency certificate is no longer valid or expires.
D. Validity. A transportation concurrency certificate is valid only for the specified uses, densities, intensity and development proposal site(s) for which it was issued and shall not be transferred to a different project or parcel. A transportation concurrency certificate shall remain valid for the longer of:
    1. One year from the date of issuance;
    2. During the period of time the development proposal associated with the certificate is under review by the city;
    3. For the same period of time as the development approval. If the development does not have an expiration date or an approved phasing schedule that allows a longer build-out, the concurrency certificate shall be valid for one year from the date of the last permit approval associated with the development proposal;
    4. For a period of time specified in an approved development agreement.
E. Expiration. A transportation concurrency certificate shall expire if any of the following occur:
    1. The time frame established in subsection D of this section is exceeded.
    2. The related development permit application is denied or revoked by the city.
    3. The related development permit expires prior to issuance of a building permit.
F. Extension. A transportation concurrency certificate shall not be extended. A new transportation concurrency application, review and certificate are required if the previous transportation concurrency certificate has expired. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.050 Transportation concurrency certificate – Denial.
A. Denial. A transportation concurrency certificate shall be denied if the number of net new trips resulting from the development proposal causes the level of service at a concurrency intersection to decline below the standards adopted in the transportation element of the comprehensive plan, unless transportation improvements or strategies to accommodate the net new trips are made concurrent with the development, subject to the provisions of subsection C of this section. The applicant shall be notified in writing that the development proposal has failed concurrency.
B. Options for Development Failing Concurrency. The applicant for a development proposal failing concurrency may:
    1. Abandon the proposed development. A project shall be deemed abandoned by the city if an applicant does not proceed under subsection (B)(2) or (B)(3) of this section.
    2. Agree in writing within 60 days of the notification of concurrency failure to:
        a. Build or provide a mitigation strategy, and provide a financial commitment, for the transportation facility improvements necessary to achieve concurrency;
        b. Phase the development to reduce the number of net new trips to a level that will achieve concurrency; and/or
        c. Modify the transportation concurrency application and the associated development proposal applications to reduce the number of net new trips to a level that will allow for concurrency approval pursuant to MICC 19.20.040.
    3. Appeal the denial to the hearing examiner in accordance with MICC 19.20.120.
C. Mitigation Criteria. The mitigation options established in subsection (B)(2) of this section shall be consistent with the following criteria:
    1. Transportation Facility Improvements or Strategies. 
        a. Administrative Approval. The code official shall approve transportation facility improvements or strategies that will achieve transportation concurrency at a concurrency intersection when the following criteria are met:
            i. The proposed improvement or strategy is consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan and is in the city’s adopted six-year transportation improvement program (TIP); and
            ii. The proposed improvement is completed, or the proposed strategy is implemented within six years of the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
        b. City Council Approval. The city council may approve a transportation facility improvement not included in the six-year TIP as transportation concurrency mitigation by amending the TIP to include the proposed improvement.
        c. Funding Commitment and Conditions. The approval of any development proposal requiring one or more transportation facility improvements to achieve concurrency shall establish conditions requiring a financial commitment by the applicant, binding on subsequent owners, for the completion of the improvement(s). The cost of the transportation improvement(s) required for concurrency may be credited towards the developer’s transportation impact fee obligation in accordance with MICC 19.19.040(D).
        d. Latecomer Agreements. The city may authorize latecomer agreements, or other reimbursement from owners of property benefited by the transportation concurrency improvements, as allowed by state law.
    2. Transportation Demand Management (TDM)/Phasing.  Transportation demand management shall include strategies designed to increase the efficiency of the transportation facilities, including, but not limited to, transit and ridesharing incentives, flexible working hours, parking management, and pedestrian and bicycle enhancements to decrease single occupancy vehicle trips. The code official shall approve a TDM strategy or phasing plan that achieves transportation concurrency when the TDM strategy or phasing plan includes:
        a. An implementation plan and schedule that is satisfactory to the code official;
        b. Methods to monitor and enforce TDM/phasing performance that is satisfactory to the code official; and
        c. A contingency plan to achieve transportation concurrency if the TDM goals are not achieved within two years of issuance of the certificate of occupancy and all necessary permit approvals. The TDM strategy/phasing plan shall be a condition of development approval and shall apply to all future property owners. The code official shall determine, consistent with accepted engineering practice, the appropriate trip reduction resulting from the proposed TDM strategy. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.060 Performance guarantee.
The code official may require a performance guarantee, as applicable, to ensure compliance with any aspect of transportation concurrency for the development proposal or construction permit approval. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.070 Intergovernmental coordination.
A. The city may enter into agreements with other local, regional, state and federal governments, to coordinate mitigation for transportation concurrency.
B. The city may apply standards and mitigation to development in the city that results in transportation impact to other local governments in the state of Washington. Approvals or permits issued by the city may include conditions and mitigation that will be imposed on behalf of and implemented by other local governments in the state of Washington. The city may agree to accept and implement conditions and mitigation that are imposed by other jurisdictions on development in their jurisdictions that impact the city. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.080 Updating level of service.
A. The code official shall determine the current level of service at concurrency intersections as of December 3, 2018. The code official shall use traffic counts and traffic modeling information produced in 2017 and 2018 as the baseline for determining current levels of service.
B. The city should update the existing levels of service at concurrency intersections at least every five years.
C. Each level of service update shall carry forward the vehicle trips for any approved development proposal that has not been completed and occupied prior to the level of service update. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.090 Administration.
A. All final decisions regarding the administration of this chapter shall be the responsibility of the code official.
B. The code official shall be authorized to establish administrative rules and procedures for administering the transportation concurrency management system. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.100 Relationship to the State Environmental Policy Act.
A. A transportation concurrency application and transportation concurrency certificate are categorically exempt from the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA).
B. This chapter establishes the minimum transportation concurrency requirements applicable to all development and is not intended to limit the city’s authority under SEPA or to evaluate all transportation impacts resulting from new development, particularly safety and operational impacts. SEPA mitigation regarding intersection operation and/or safety may be included as conditions of the transportation concurrency certificate at the discretion of the code official. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.110 Fees.
The city shall charge a processing fee to any individual or entity that applies for a transportation concurrency certificate. Such fees shall be determined by resolution of the city council. An additional fee will be required if, in the sole judgment of the code official, use of the city’s transportation model is necessary for making a transportation concurrency determination. All transportation concurrency processing fees shall be paid in full upon application for a transportation concurrency certificate. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

19.20.120 Appeals.
A decision on a transportation concurrency certificate may be appealed pursuant to Chapter 19.15 MICC. (Ord. 18C-12 § 1).

J. Perform any other function assigned to the lead agency or responsible official by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in MICC 19.21.040. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.080 Lead agency determination and responsibilities.
A. The city department receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall ask the responsible official to determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050 and  197-11-922 through 197-11-940  unless the lead agency has been previously determined.
B. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the responsible official shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements and, if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS.
C. When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all city departments shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.
D. If the city or any city department receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC  197-11-922 through 197-11-940 , it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the Department of Ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period. Any such petition on behalf of the city must be initiated by the responsible official.
E.  City departments are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided, the responsible official and any city department that will incur responsibilities as the result of any such agreement approve the agreement. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.090 Timing of the environmental review process.
A. The timing of the environmental review process shall be determined based on the criteria in the SEPA rules and this section.
B. If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications as part of a complete application for such permit or license, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of such detailed plans and specifications. A decision as to whether or not to do early environmental review, prior to receiving a complete application, shall be at the discretion of the responsible official.
C. The responsible official may elect to do early environmental review if adequate information is available to determine the size and scope of the proposed action, including dimensions and use of all proposed structures, project timing, and the extent of clearing and grading.
D. The city may initiate preliminary environmental review and have informal conferences with applicants prior to receipt of a complete application. However, this review shall not be binding on the city or the applicant.
E. For city-initiated proposals, the initiating city department should contact the responsible official as soon as a proposal is formulated to integrate environmental concerns into the decision-making process as soon as possible.
F. The procedural requirements of SEPA and this chapter shall be completed prior to the issuance of a permit or final decision on a nonexempt proposal. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.100 Determination of categorical exemption.
A. Upon the receipt of an application for a proposal, the receiving city department shall, and for city proposals, the initiating city department shall, determine whether the proposal is an action potentially subject to SEPA and, if so, whether it is categorically exempt. This determination shall be made based on the definition of action (WAC 197-11-704), and the process for determining categorical exemption (WAC 197-11-305). As required, city departments shall ensure that the total proposal is considered. If there is any question whether or not a proposal is exempt, then the responsible official shall be consulted.
B. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal. The determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final and not subject to administrative review.
C. If the proposal is not categorically exempt, the city department making this determination (if different from proponent) shall notify the proponent of the proposal that it must submit an environmental checklist (or copies thereof) to the responsible official.
D. If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that:
    1. The city shall not give authorization for:
        a. Any nonexempt action;
        b. Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or
        c. Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives;
    2. A city department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and
    3. A city department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt actions were not approved.
E. The following types of construction shall be categorically exempt, except when undertaken wholly or partly on lands covered by water, or a rezone or any license governing emissions to the air or discharges to water is required:
    1. The construction or location of any residential structures of four or fewer dwelling units;
    2. The construction of an office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage building with 4,000 square feet or less of gross floor area and with associated parking facilities designed for 20 or fewer automobiles;
    3. The construction of a parking lot designed for 20 or fewer automobiles;
    4. Any landfill or excavation of 500 cubic yards or less throughout the total lifetime of the fill or excavation; and any fill or excavation classified as a Class I, II, or III forest practice under RCW 76.09.050 or regulations thereunder. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.110 Environmental checklist.
A. A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency.
B. For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the city department initiating the proposal shall complete the checklist for that proposal.
C. The city may complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if either of the following occurs:
    1. The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant; or
    2. The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.120 Threshold determination.
The responsible official shall make the threshold determination and issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) or significance (DS). The responsible official shall make such threshold determination in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 197-11 WAC, Part 3, as adopted by this chapter. The responsible official shall notify the applicant, the lead city department, and (where a permit is involved) the permit-issuing city department of the threshold determination. The decision of the responsible official to issue a determination of significance shall not be appealable. The decision of the responsible official to issue a determination of nonsignificance shall be appealable pursuant to MICC 19.21.200. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.130 Early notice of threshold determination and mitigated DNS.
A. As provided in this chapter and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant.
B. An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:
    1. Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the city department is lead agency; and
    2. Precede the city’s actual threshold determination for the proposal.
C. The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 10 working days. The response shall:
    1. Be written;
    2. State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and
    3. State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.
D. The city’s written response under subsection B of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination.
E. As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures.
F. When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 15 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal:
    1. If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2).
    2. If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate.
    3. The applicant’s proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific and feasible. For example, proposals to “control noise” or “prevent storm water runoff” are inadequate, whereas proposals to “muffle machinery to X decibel” or “construct 200-foot storm water detention pond at Y location” are adequate.
    4.  Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other documents.
G. A proposal shall not be considered changed or clarified to permit the issuance of a mitigated DNS under WAC 197-11-350 unless all license applications for the proposal are revised to conform to the changes or other binding commitments made.
H. If a mitigated DNS is issued, the aspects of the proposal that allowed a mitigated DNS to be issued shall be included in any decision or recommendation of approval of the action. Mitigation measures incorporated into the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city.
I. A mitigated DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice.
J. If at any time the proposal (including associated mitigating measures) is substantially changed, the responsible official shall reevaluate the threshold determination and, if necessary, withdraw the mitigated DNS and issue a DS. Any questions regarding whether or not a change is substantial shall be resolved by the responsible official. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.140 Environmental impact statements.
A. An environmental impact statement shall be required on any proposal determined to be a major action having a probable significant, adverse environmental impact. If it is determined that an environmental impact statement is required, the responsible official shall notify the applicant or proposal sponsor, the lead city department and (where a permit is involved) the department responsible for issuing the permit. The responsible official shall arrange for a meeting with the applicant or proposal sponsor to schedule necessary events and give any guidance necessary in the preparation of the EIS.
B. For private proposals, an EIS shall be prepared by a private applicant or agent thereof or by the city. For city proposals, the EIS shall be prepared by a consultant or by city staff. In all cases, the method of preparation and the selection of the consultant shall be subject to the approval of the responsible official. The responsible official shall ensure that the EIS is prepared in a responsible and professional manner and with appropriate methodology and consistent with SEPA rules. The responsible official shall also direct the areas of research and examination to be undertaken as a result of the scoping process, as well as the organization of the resulting document. The responsible official may retain the services of a consultant to review all or portions of EIS prepared by an applicant, the applicant’s agent, or the city, at the applicant’s expense. Services rendered by the responsible official and other city staff shall be subject to collection of fees as described in the city’s officially adopted land use and planning fee schedule.
C. The responsible official will coordinate any predraft consultation procedures and scoping procedures so that the consultant preparing the EIS immediately receives all substantive information submitted by consulted agencies or through the scoping process. The responsible official shall also attempt to obtain any information needed by the consultant preparing the EIS which is on file with another agency or federal agency.
D. An environmental impact statement is required to analyze those probable adverse environmental impacts which are significant. Beneficial environmental impacts may be discussed. The responsible official shall consult with agencies, affected tribes and the public to identify such impacts and limit the scope of an environmental impact statement in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection E of this section. The purpose of the scoping process is to narrow the scope of every EIS to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures.
E. Procedures for Scoping. 
    1. The responsible official shall consult with agencies and the public to limit the scope of an environmental impact statement by any or all of the following means. The specific method to be followed shall be determined on a proposal-by-proposal basis by the responsible official, but at a minimum shall include the following:
        a. The responsible official shall give notice that an EIS is to be prepared, which notice shall provide that agencies, affected tribes and the public may submit written comments to identify significant impacts and reasonable alternatives and limit the scope of the EIS. Comments must be submitted not later than 21 days from the date of issuance of the declaration of significance. Additionally, notice may be sent to any community groups known by the responsible official to have a possible interest in the proposal. Notice of the intent to prepare an EIS and the opportunity for commenting on the scope thereof may be sent with other public notices concerning the project.
        b. Additionally, the responsible official may conduct a meeting to provide the opportunity for oral comment on the scope of the EIS. Notice of such meeting shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation at least five days prior to the date of the meeting. The scoping meeting may be combined with other meetings or hearings concerning the proposal.
    2. The appendix to the EIS shall include an identification of the issues raised during the scoping process and whether those issues have or have not been determined significant for analysis in the EIS. All written comments regarding the scope of the EIS shall be included in the proposal file.
    3. The public and agency consulting process regarding the scope of the EIS shall normally occur within 30 days after the declaration of significance is issued, unless the responsible official and the applicant agree on a later date.
    4. EIS preparation may begin during scoping.
F. The following additional elements may, at the option of the responsible official, be considered part of the environment for the purpose of EIS content, but do not add to the criteria for the threshold determinations or perform any other function or purpose under these rules:
    1. Economy;
    2. Social policy analysis;
    3. Cost-benefit analysis.
G. When a public hearing is held under WAC 197-11-535(2), such hearing shall be held before the responsible official. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.150 Internal circulation of environmental documents.
Environmental documents shall be transmitted to decisionmakers and advisory bodies prior to their taking official action on proposals subject to SEPA. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.160 Emergencies.
The responsible official shall designate when an action constitutes an emergency under WAC 197-11-880. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.170 Public notice.
A. Whenever the city issues a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2) or a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), the city shall give public notice of the DNS or DS by publishing notice in the city’s permit information bulletin.
B. Whenever the city issues a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), the city shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in the DS as required in WAC 197-11-408 and in the public notice.
C. Whenever the city issues a DEIS under WAC 197-11-455(5) or a SEIS under WAC 197-11-620, notice of the availability of those documents shall be given by:
    1. Indicating the availability of the DEIS in any public notice required for a nonexempt license; and
    2. Publishing notice in the city’s permit information bulletin.
D. Whenever an EIS hearing is required, the hearing shall be combined with the hearing on the underlying action and notice shall be provided in the manner specified in MICC 19.15.020.
E. The city shall integrate the public notice required under this chapter with existing notice procedures for the city’s nonexempt permit(s) or approval(s) required for the proposal.
F. The responsible official may also elect to give notice by one or more of the other methods specified in WAC 197-11-510.
G. The city may require an applicant to complete the public notice requirements for the applicant’s proposal at his or her expense. (Ord. 19C-07 § 1 (Exh. A)).

19.21.180 Fees.
Environmental ChecklistThe city shall establish a fee for review of an environmental checklist performed by the city when the city is the lead agency. The fee shall be identified in the city’s officially adopted land use and planning fee schedule, and collected prior to undertaking a threshold determination.
Environmental Impact StatementsFor all proposals when the city is the lead agency and the responsible official determines that an EIS is required, the applicant shall be charged a fee for the administrative costs of supervision and preparation of the draft and final EISs. This fee shall be identified in the city’s officially adopted land use and planning fee schedule, and collected prior to the initiation of work on the draft EIS. 
A. For private proposals, the cost of retaining consultants for assistance in EIS preparation shall be borne by the applicant whether the consultant is retained directly by the applicant or by the city.
B. Consultant Agency Fees. No fees shall be collected by the city for performing its duty as a consultant agency.
C. Document Fees.

Appendix B BASEMENT FLOOR AREA CALCULATION
The Mercer Island Development Code excludes that portion of the basement floor area from the Gross Floor Area which is below the existing or finished grade, whichever is lower. That portion of the basement which will be excluded is calculated as shown.
Portion of Excluded Basement Floor Area =
Total Basement Area x     Σ(Wall Segment Coverage x Wall Segment Length)
    Total of all Wall Segment lengths
Where the terms are defined as follows:
TOTAL BASEMENT AREA is the total amount of all basement floor area.
WALL SEGMENT COVERAGE is the portion of an exterior wall below existing or finished grade, whichever is lower. It is expressed as a percentage. (Refer to example.)
WALL SEGMENT LENGTH is the horizontal length of each exterior wall in feet.
[IMAGE: <19AppxB_001.jpg>]
EXAMPLE OF BASEMENT FLOOR AREA CALCULATION
This example illustrates how a portion of the basement floor area may be excluded from the Gross Floor Area. In order to complete this example, the following information is needed.
AA topographic map of the existing grades and the proposed finished grades.
BBuilding plans showing dimensions of all exterior wall segments and floor areas.
CBuilding elevations showing the location of existing and proposed finished grades in relation to basement level.
Step One
[IMAGE: <19AppxB_002.jpg>]
Determine the number and lengths of the Wall Segments.
Step Two
Determine the Wall Segment Coverage (in %) for each Wall Segment. In most cases this will be readily apparent, for example a downhill elevation which is entirely above existing grade or will be entirely above finished grade. In other cases where the existing or finished grade contours are complex, an averaging system shall be used. (Refer to illustration.)
[IMAGE: <19AppxB_003.jpg>]
Step Three
Multiply each Wall Segment Length by the percentage of each Wall Segment Coverage and add these results together. Divide that number by the sum of all Wall Segment Lengths. This calculation will result in a percentage of basement wall which is below grade. (This calculation is most easily completed by compiling a table of the information as illustrated below.)
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| Wall Segment | Length x | Coverage = | Result |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| A            | 25′      | 56%        | 14′    |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| B            | 10′      | 0%         | 0′     |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| C            | 8′       | 0%         | 0′     |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| D            | 25′      | 0%         | 0′     |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| E            | 8′       | 0%         | 0′     |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| F            | 13′      | 0%         | 0′     |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| G            | 25′      | 60%        | 15′    |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| H            | 48′      | 100%       | 48′    |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
| Totals       | 162′     | NA         | 77′    |
+--------------+----------+------------+--------+
Step Four
Multiply the Total Basement Floor Area by the above percentage to determine the Excluded Basement Floor Area.
Portion of Excluded Basement Floor Area =
=1,400 Sq. Ft. x    (25′ x 56% + 10′ x 0% . . . 25′ x 60% + 48′ x 100%)
162'
=1,400 Sq. Ft. x 47.53%
=665.42 Sq. Ft. Excluded from the Gross Floor Area (Ord. 17C-15 § 1 (Att. A)).

Appendix C DESIGN GUIDELINES OF THE MERCER ISLAND DESIGN COMMISSION ADOPTED MAY 14, 1973

SIGN GUIDELINES.
(Repealed by Ord. 04C-08)

ARTERIAL RIGHT-OF-WAY GUIDELINES.
CONCEPTS:
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_001.png>]
The intent of the guidelines is to develop further goals and objectives synthesized from previous Mercer Island planning studies, the community and the Design Commission in order to provide a framework within which right-of-way improvements may be implemented that will result in a coherent, continuous right-of-way system representative of the island environment and complementary to its natural character.
The following GOALS, INTENTIONS and CRITERIA constitute a basis for evaluating improvements and development as they may contribute to the overall intended right-of-way system.
CLASSIFICATION:
In consideration of the general environmental characteristics of the Island, the arterial right-of-ways have been grouped into three general classifications which are applicable to Mercer Island: rural, suburban and urban. Several of the arterials may have more than a single classification depending on their basic character. For the purpose of developing guidelines, only the major distinct segments of an arterial have been differentiated.
Because there is general community consensus that the rural characteristics of the Island should be retained, right-of-way development must be evaluated, not only on the basis of the prevalent classification for any one arterial, but also on the basis of retaining and reinforcing the much-sought-after rural image. For this reason the suburban segments of any one right-of-way should be subordinated to the rural segments and development “downgraded” accordingly.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_002.png>]
These arterials have also been assigned route and section numbers by the Public Works Department which are recognized by the Urban Arterial Board, as well as an arterial designation of major, secondary, and collector. However, since the guidelines deal chiefly with visual characteristics of the right-of-way, the arterial section designations have been introduced primarily as a means of reference. Diagrams keying the classification are found with the corresponding guidelines under rural, suburban, and urban right-of-way headings.
The rural right-of-ways are generally characterized by continuous vegetation belts, ravines, hillsides, winding roadways, group access drives, and relative freedom from infringing housing. These are the right-of-ways most highly characteristic of the Island environment and provide a unique exposure to Mercer Island for both visitors and residents. This category includes the majority of the Mercer Ways, Island Crest from SE 53rd Pl. to SE 68th, the majority of SE 53rd Pl., SE 68th east of Island Crest, and Gallagher Hill Rd.
The suburban right-of-ways pass through fairly dense residential communities d are characterized by closely adjoining housing, uniform front yard setbacks, individual driveways, and a lack of continuous vegetation buffers. This category includes SE 40th, SE 24th, 72nd SE, 78th SE, Island Crest from SE 40th to SE 53rd Pl., a portion of SE 53rd Pl., 84th SE, SE 68th and SE 72nd, SE 70th Pl., Merrimount Dr., and portions of the Mercer Ways.
The urban right-of-ways are the arterials within and adjoining the Business District. Island Crest north of SE 40th is the only right-of-way covered in this section.
TRAILS
A.BICYCLE FACILITIES
Different needs exist for bicycles in urban right-of-ways than in rural. The volume, composition and speed of vehicular traffic as well as topography generally dictate the type of system that should be provided. There are three basic types of bicycle facilities:
Shared Right-Of-Way (Class III Bikeway): a mixture of motorized vehicle and bicycle traffic in the same roadway; low vehicular volumes and speeds are a prerequisite.
Bicycle Lane (Class II Bikeway): a separately designated facility for bicycle traffic following the alignment of the roadway. The separation may be made by curbing, striping or buttons as required to insure bicycle safety.
Bicycle Path (Class I Bikeway): a facility that is separated from motorized vehicles and may or may not parallel the alignment of the roadway.
B.PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Pedestrian facilities exist for purposes of commuting, recreation, exercise, health and pleasure, and must accommodate a variety of uses. For example, a facility chiefly in use by children capable of quick, erratic movements needs special safety consideration. This is particularly applicable in areas where schools, parks, playgrounds, etc., are the predominant pedestrian traffic generators.
Likewise, surfacing materials must be compatible with the right-of-way, surrounding landscape, topography, and drainage conditions. Pathways may be paved, covered with gravel or wood chips, or simply left in their natural state (e.g. the pathway network along Island Crest Park owes much of its charm to its meandering, unpaved state).
There are two types of pedestrian facilities that may be implemented within the right-of-ways:
Sidewalk or Lane: adjacent to roadway, either paved (sidewalk) or unsurfaced (lane).
Path: independently aligned and generally landscaped to enhance the walkers’ experience.
C.JOINT BICYCLE/PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
In areas where right-of-way widths, road conditions, or grades restrict separate bicycle/pedestrian routes, a joint facility may be implemented. It is particularly appropriate in situations where pedestrian traffic is minimal or grades are such to preclude excessive bicycle speeds. A joint facility, particularly one designed to accommodate two way bicycle traffic, may also be advantageous where excessive pavement widening may not be a desirable right-of-way improvement.
Joint Bicycle/Pedestrian Lane: following the alignment of the roadway, either directly adjacent or separated from the roadway.
Joint Bicycle/Pedestrian Path: independently aligned and separated from the roadway.
GENERAL GOALS
In order to enable a more specific consideration of the design criteria of individual right-of-ways, the general overriding considerations that are applicable to all right-of-ways are given here as reference for the more specific considerations that follow.
1.Develop right-of-ways consistent with the overall natural Island character and scale, with particular consideration given to any UAB and highway standards that may diminish the rural quality of the Island.
2.Emphasize key intersections and gateways that serve as an introduction to the Island by treating them in a manner that is representative of the best of the Island environment.
3.Develop views and vistas from the road as a means of locating and orienting the user to the Island.
4.Establish a safe and efficient system for all modes of acceptable traffic and encourage public transportation and pedestrian/bicycle facilities in appropriate locations, particularly in situations where they may serve schools and other public facilities.
5.Accommodate pedestrian/bicycle facilities by joint-use such as shared right-of-ways and joint bicycle/pedestrian facilities, with minimum widening of the paved surface.
6.Restore the Island environment and enhance the “street scene” by eventual undergrounding of utilities.
7.Provide direct and easy access to major Island “destination points”.
8.Link communities, neighborhoods and facilities.
9.Provide adequate information regarding speed, location, and public destination points.
10.Discourage on-street parking except as provided by emergency regulation.
GUIDELINES
RURAL RIGHT-OF-WAYS: majority of Mercer Ways, Island Crest from SE 53rd Pl., to SE 68th, most of SE 53rd Pl., SE 68th east of Island Crest, a portion of SE 70th Pl., and Gallagher Hill Rd. For route section locations see the adjoining map.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_003.png>]
GOAL:
Retain, restore and enhance the natural Island environment as perceived from the right-of-way.
INTENT:
1.Treat the full length of the right-of-ways as a continuous road/Island experience.
2.Emphasize and enhance views to ravines and occasional views to the Lake, Seattle and the East Shore.
3.Retain the “rural road” atmosphere and minimize further disruption of the right-of-way within the “Critical Environment Zone” as previously identified, within which the majority of these right-of-ways lie.
4.Strengthen vistas and important axes.
5.Reinforce the image of the roadway as a continuum of the landscape elements adjoining the right-of-way.
6.Prevent further infringement of buildings, fencing and street furniture elements through the use of adequate vegetation buffers, building and street furniture setbacks as well as height and size restrictions.
7.Provide adequate lighting to delineate the roadway in keeping with its intrinsic appearance.
CRITERIA:
1a.Buildings should be sited to preserve the maximum natural vegetation buffer along the right-of-way.
1b.Use of predominant Island plant materials is suggested to buffer structures and reinforce the vegetation belts within the right-of-way, with special attention given to the reforesting of those areas that are in need of reinforcement or are an obvious break to the continuous vegetation enclosure of the right-of way. Private easements should be considered wherever buffers within the right-of-ways are not sufficient to provide the desired roadway enclosure. The easements should be planted and maintained by the City for a period of one year.
2a.Preserve existing views and vistas at locations designated as viewpoints by limiting building sites, restricting building heights, and encouraging selective clearing and/or planting of vegetation both within the right-of-way and outside it if possible. See arterial landscape master plan.

2b.Automobile turnouts should be developed at designated viewpoints to enhance the driving experience, provide for safe passing, accommodate school bus loading and emergency snow storm parking. Turnouts should be surfaced with pervious materials and, where location permits, should be left as much as possible in their natural state. Turnouts should be delineated by wood or log tire stops to prevent damage to groundcovers and low planting adjoining the roadway.
3a.Eliminate individual driveways in favor of group access drives in order to minimize disruption of roadways and vegetation.
3b.Limit the width of the road to two lanes, with additional pavement width permitted in curved sections where extra width may be required for safety purposes. Wherever possible, extend the plant materials to the pavement edge to further contain the width of the roadway.
4a.Strengthen vistas and important axes by selective clearing, elimination of conflicting street furniture elements such as utility poles, wiring, and fencing, and selection and planting of plant materials within the right-of-way that will heighten and emphasize the view.
5a.Repair all bank cuts and restore to near natural state cut and fill areas by replanting with indigenous plant material, with particular attention given to groundcovers that will help re-establish and retain slopes. Particular attention is directed to the planting and stabilization of banks along East Mercer Way. See arterial landscape master plan.
5b.On-street parking should be discouraged except at turnouts for designated viewpoints, trailheads, and during emergencies as stipulated by Resolution 504.
5c-6a. Buildings should be sited to preserve views of ravines and hillsides that are integral to the overall image and character of the right-of-way.
6b.Screen out all private fencing by planting buffers within the right-of-way if the fencing detracts from or is not in keeping with the overall roadway appearance.
6c.Screen all public utility installations visible from the right-of-way with adequate planting, and consider the use of ivy or similar vines along all chain link fencing except in specific instances where such planting may obstruct a view that contributes to the overall roadway experience and character.
7a.Lighting should be of a low level, more for the purposes of indicating the configuration of the roadway than for general illumination. The lighting standards should preferably be of wood and of a natural and unobtrusive finish, at a height of 12-16 feet. Lighting should occur at all intersections, at pathway/road crossings, and at private driveways wherever this is feasible without disrupting the overall spacing and sequence of the lighting. (Also see Public Signing, Lighting and Other Street Furniture.)
7b.Security lighting, gateway or driveway lighting should be used so as not to infringe upon the right-of-way where it may be a danger to the motorist and a hazard or nuisance to the pedestrian or bicyclist.
GOAL:
Encourage use of the right-of-way as a means of providing access to the Island’s ravine/open space system for recreational purposes.
INTENT:
1.Provide for bicycle and pedestrian use of the right-of-way.
2.Consider the open space trail system as an extension of the right-of-way and make it more readily accessible for public use.
CRITERIA:
1a.Maintain roadway to minimum widths as provided in 3b. above.
1b.Consider a number of bicycle turnouts along the Mercer Ways, removed from the vehicular traffic and developed in conjunction with a bicycle path system that could thus provide rest-stops for the round-Island cyclist.
1c.Insure safe pedestrian/bicycle crossings of the roadway at all intersections, and wherever topography dictates, allow for the relocation of the path from one side to the other, by signing and locating crossing within relatively straight road sections with maximum two-way visibility.
2a.Provide 1-2 car turnouts at all trailheads.
2b.Private easements should be evaluated in order to accommodate both bicyclists and pedestrians as an alternate to right-of-way use, particularly in locations where safety considerations demand segregation of traffic.
Easements should be secured on all new developments with connecting links through previously developed land obtained as opportunity arises. Easements should be obtained in keeping with the Island wide trail system.
1d-2b. Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities:
a.Mercer Ways: Route 2 except for northern portion of section 2/10; route 5 except for northern portion of section 5/10; portions of section 6/20 and 6/40.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_004.png>]
It is recommended that bicycle travel be accommodated along the Mercer Ways through a separation of the bicycle facility by a minimum setback of 5 feet from the roadway wherever topography permits. In considering the facility, extra care should be given to potential disruption of the right-of-way and its adjoining landscape. In some instances a continuous separately designated bicycle facility may be extremely difficult to implement.
Pedestrian lanes or pedestrian use of the separated bicycle facility should be considered, particularly along those portions of the Mercer Ways where school traffic or access to public open space trails must be accommodated.
b.Island Crest: Section 1/30.
A bicycle path could readily be implemented along the east side of Island Crest where a sufficient width of cleared right-of-way now exists to easily accommodate a two-way bicycle path. The setback from the roadway to the path should be planted with native trees and groundcovers similar to those that exist on the west side of the right-of-way.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_005.png>]
The pedestrian path that now exists along Island Crest Park should be maintained because it is of a scale that is appropriate to the natural setting of the island. Special care should be taken in maintaining and reinforcing the existing trees and groundcovers within this portion of the right-of-way to insure that the character of the path, which is largely dependent upon its narrow and meandering nature, is maintained.
Pedestrian paths south of SE 63rd are recommended for the east side of the right-of-way adjoining the proposed bicycle path, with the Pioneer Park edge left undisturbed.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_006.png>]
If portions of this section of Island Crest are widened to accommodate a turning lane to cross streets, extreme care should be taken to preserve the character of the right-of-way by retaining the existing vegetation edge along Island Crest and Pioneer Parks. The roadway pavement should be kept at a minimum width and medians resulting from the turning lanes should be planted with groundcovers and perhaps occasional trees that are in keeping with the existing native materials along the western edge of the right-of-way.
c.SE 53rd Place: Route 9 except for the western portion of section 9/20.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_007.png>]
That portion of SE 53rd Pl. east of Island Crest, section 9/10 could easily accommodate downhill bicycle traffic by means of a shared right-of-way or a bicycle lane. To insure user safety due to the relatively steep grades, a separate bicycle facility to accommodate uphill traffic should be implemented. A unique opportunity exists for such a facility along the south side of the right-of-way which adjoins one of the major Island ravines and is uninterrupted by private driveways. The uphill bicycle facility could be implemented as a joint bicycle/pedestrian path, particularly appropriate for joint use due to the slow uphill bicycle speeds.
A bicycle facility along SE 53rd Pl. due west of Island Crest, section 9/20 should be implemented to facilitate cross Island travel when this arterial is completed. Every effort should be made to retain the rural character of the upper portion of section 9/20. This should be the major consideration and for this reason a shared right-of-way along this portion of the roadway is recommended.
A minimal pedestrian lane or path is recommended along this portion of SE 53rd Pl. as a means of accommodating pedestrian school traffic to the adjoining elementary school.
Informal clusters of native trees are recommended along this right-of-way, particularly along section 9/10 which should receive substantial tree planting in order to reduce the excessive width of the right-of-way and extend the adjoining ravine vegetation within closer proximity of the roadway. Clusters of trees should also be utilized to separate the roadway from the bicycle/pedestrian path. Groundcovers should be extended to the road and pathway edge.
With substantial planting, SE 53rd Pl. could visually become an integral part of the ravine, instead of merely skirting its edge.
d.SE 68th and SE 70th Place: The western two-thirds of section 0/10, route 10.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_008.png>]
In order to keep the paved roadway to a minimum through this section of SE 68th adjoining Pioneer Park, a minimal bicycle path and a shared right-of-way should be adequate to serve both uphill and downhill traffic. The potential use of the easement along 92nd SE should be considered as a bicycle connection to East Mercer Way, by-passing the lower portion of SE 70th P1.
A combination of a pedestrian lane and path along one side of the roadway or a joint use of the bicycle path should be adequate to handle pedestrian traffic, since the network of trails within Pioneer Park can be expected to carry a substantial number of trail users along this section of SE 68th. The existing forest edge of Pioneer Park should be maintained. Groundcovers or grass should be extended to the road and pathway edge.
e.Gallagher Hill Rd.: Route 3 sections 3/30 and 3/40.
Due to the fairly high volume of vehicular traffic anticipated for Gallagher Hill Rd. as a collector/distributor to the I-90 interchange, special consideration is recommended for this right-of-way in order to maintain its present rural character.
It would appear that the extension of the bicycle facility along SE 40th would be better accommodated along Mercerwood Dr., for to safely implement a facility along Gallagher Hill Rd. would mean a substantial widening of the roadway pavement, particularly in view of its steep grades.
A pedestrian pathway could easily be implemented along the western side of the right-of-way, either along its full length or only the upper portions, as a means of providing pedestrian access to potential future public easements within the adjoining ravine.
GOAL:
Minimize disruption of the natural processes within the right-of-way.
INTENT:
1.Maintain and preserve natural drainage patterns that contribute to the ravine system and its vegetation.
2.Maintain and restore the visual continuity of the ravine physiography.
3.Control runoff, siltation and erosion.
CRITERIA:
1a.Within a period of one year, restore all scarred, retained and severely cut and/or filled areas that interfere with the natural drainage patterns.
1b.Daylight culverts with extra attention given to area to be drained, groundcover type, rainfall intensity, and slope.
1c-2. Plant native groundcovers on all cuts and slopes and secure with hemp matting as necessary to establish growth. Particular attention is directed to East Mercer Way. (See arterial landscape master plan.)
3a.Limit expansion and extent of paved surfaces by maintaining minimum road widths and using pervious surfacing materials for all turnouts and viewpoints or preferably leaving these unsurfaced wherever possible.
SUBURBAN RIGHT-OF-WAYS: (a) SE 40th, (b) SE 24th, (c) 72nd SE, (d) 78th SE, (e) Island Crest from SE 53rd Pl. to SE 40th, (f) SE 53rd Pl., (g) 84th SE, SE 68th and SE 72nd, (h) SE 70th Pl., (i) Merrimount Dr., (j) portions of Mercer Ways.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_009.png>]
GOAL:
Enhance and develop the roadway as an extension of the adjoining properties within the context of the overall Island character.
INTENT:
1.Minimize disruption of adjoining residential community.
2.Provide for pedestrian and bicycle safety.
3.Delineate tile right-of-way corridor to enhance the roadway and adjoining community.
4.Reduce the apparent width of the roadway.
5.Maintain continuity with adjoining landforms and topography.
CRITERIA:
1a.Maintain minimum safe road widths. With the exception of Island Crest and portions of SE 40th and 24th SE, the two lane arterial should be maintained as the standard for all suburban right-of-ways.
1b.Wherever possible sufficient planting should separate the roadway from the adjoining residential community to maintain the continuity of the road and provide a degree of privacy to the adjoining housing.
1c-3a. Lighting should be of an intensity to provide general illumination to the right-of-way corridor in order to delineate the roadway, enhance its landscape treatment, and provide for user safety without disrupting the adjoining community or causing an excessive area-wide lighting effect.
Lighting standards should preferably be of wood or other materials with an unobtrusive finish. Standards should not exceed 22 feet in height. Additional lighting may be mounted at intersections, preferably by doubling the source on a single standard. (Also see Public Signing, Lighting and Other Street Furniture).
2a.Open drainage ditches should be converted to storm drains due to the need for bicycle and pedestrian provisions, particularly in light of the dense, single family communities adjoining the majority of these right-of-ways.
2b-3b. Obtain easements as necessary to allow for pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular separation as well as planting buffers.
3c.Private path or slope easements should be developed by the City, planted and maintained for a period of one year.
3d-4. Consider the use of street trees to delineate the roadway and reduce its apparent width, to shield the utility poles and wiring until eventual undergrounding, and to integrate the right-of-way with the adjoining community, with attention given to road visibility, particularly at intersections.
5.Repair all bank cuts and restore to near natural state, cut and fill areas by replanting with materials that will help establish and retain slopes, are in keeping with the adjoining residential community and the natural landscape character of the Island.
RIGHT-OF-WAY DEVELOPMENT:
a.SE 40th Street: Route 3, from West Mercer Way to Gallagher Hill Rd., including sections 3/10 and 3/20.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_010.png>]
A combination of a bicycle lane and a joint bicycle/pedestrian path or lane with maximum separation from the roadway as permitted within the existing right-of-way should be adequate to accommodate two-way bicycle travel along SE 40th from 92nd SE to 70th or 76th SE, depending upon which route is used as an access to the Business District. Private easements should be considered as a means to provide more generous facility separation and planting buffers. The unimproved portion of SE 40th should be developed in a similar manner if and when the arterial connection is extended to West Mercer Way.
Wherever right-of-way conditions or easements permit the implementation of a pedestrian path, such a facility should be considered. Where a path is not feasible a lane or a joint bicycle/pedestrian path may be implemented, with special attention given to the separation of pedestrian and downhill bicycle traffic where high bicycle speeds may be a danger to the pedestrian.
There is an opportunity along SE 40th to introduce occasional street medians which should be planted as a further means of dividing the roadway. Occasional street trees in informal cluster patterns are suggested for this right-of-way both within the median and the planting buffers between the roadway, the pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and the adjoining property. Plant materials should be of a type common to the Island, but may be contrasted with occasional groupings of flowering or ornamental trees. Special recognition should be given to the plant materials of the adjoining properties and a pleasing transition achieved from the private to the public sector wherever this is appropriate.
b.SE 24th Street: Route 12 from West Mercer Way to 76th SE.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_011.png>]
Due to steep grades and relatively high traffic volumes, bicycle facilities are not recommended for this arterial. Pedestrian sidewalks which are suggested for both sides of the arterial may accommodate uphill bicycle traffic. An alternate bicycle route bypassing SE 24th may be implemented along 72nd SE as a means of tying into North Mercer Way.
Street trees are recommended at approximately 30 feet on center along both sides of SE 24th. Plant material should be of the standard street tree variety, such as red maple, sycamore, oak, linden, etc.
The pavement width from 71st SE to West Mercer Way is excessive for a two lane arterial. It is recommended that the current width is maintained only to accommodate a left turn lane onto West Mercer Way with the remainder of the right-of-way devoted to planting and pedestrian facilities.
c.72nd Ave. SE: Route 7, section 7/10.
Since closely adjoining residential properties make a separated bicycle facility along this arterial unrealistic, a shared right-of-way is recommended.
When the remaining open drainage ditches are covered, the pedestrian lanes that now adjoin the roadway are suggested for conversion to paths that are setback from the roadway by a planting buffer wherever feasible.
Informal cluster planting should be implemented within the right-of-way or easements secured for planting purposes, particularly along sections where the cover has been removed, in order to delineate the roadway and provide a measure of screening for the adjoining housing. Wherever possible cluster planting should be introduced between the roadway and the path to further enhance the walkers’ experience.
Special attention should be given to the use of informal cluster planting as a means of breaking up the extensive gravelled shoulders that extend from the right-of-way onto private property and are used for parking purposes by adjoining residents. Private easements should be obtained wherever additional planting would aid the streetscape, and planted by the City in conjunction with the overall right-of-way development.
d.78th Ave. SE: Route 4, section 4/10 and that portion of section 4/20 south of SE 32nd.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_012.png>]
Separate bicycle provision may not be necessary for 78th SE since 76th SE and SE 34th may easily be utilized as a designated shared right-of-way from SE 40th to the Business District. That portion of 78th SE from SE 34th to the Business District could be designated as a shared right-of-way or a bicycle facility could be implemented as part of the development of the Mercerdale site to provide access to the Business District from SE 34th.
If bicycle traffic is to be routed along 78th SE, it is recommended that a joint two-way bicycle/pedestrian path be implemented along the east side of the right-of-way. A separated sidewalk and bicycle lane could easily be implemented along the 80 foot portion of the right-of-way by limiting the adjoining local access drive to one-way traffic. This joint bicycle/pedestrian facility could also be implemented to accommodate a one-way bicycle route north, with use of 77th Pl. SE as a shared right-of-way to accommodate a bicycle route south.
Sidewalks along both sides of the arterial are the recommended pedestrian facilities.
That portion of SE 78th south of SE 40th could easily be utilized as a shared right-of-way to accommodate bicycle traffic from West Mercer Way to the Business District. Pedestrian lanes and planting are recommended as in c. above. An alternate facility may be a joint bicycle/pedestrian path along one side of the right-of-way.
SE 78th north of SE 40th is recommended for street trees and median trees at approximately 30 feet on center. Plant materials should be an extension of the sycamores, red maples and ivy used on SE 78th within the Business District.
e.Island Crest Way: Route 1, section 1/20.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_013.png>]
Due to the high traffic volume and speeds along Island Crest, a bicycle lane or path, or a joint bicycle/pedestrian lane or path is recommended. In both cases, these facilities are recommended for consolidated two-way traffic in order to minimize the pavement expanse and provide optimum right-of-way landscaping.
Present use patterns suggest that a sidewalk along the west side in combination with a two-way joint bicycle/pedestrian lane or path along the east side of the right-of-way may be sufficient to accommodate the traffic along this portion of Island Crest. This joint bicycle/pedestrian facility may not be possible north of approximately SE 42nd unless additional easements are obtained due to the existing 60 foot right-of-way. By routing the bicycle traffic along 86th SE where a joint two-way bicycle lane can be quite easily accommodated, this northern portion of the Island Crest right-of-way could be generously landscaped. The joint two-way bicycle/pedestrian facility along the east side could be developed into an informal meandering lane to accommodate not only bicycle/pedestrian traffic, but also bus stops, seating and occasional turnouts for bicycle rest stops with generous planting buffers from the roadway.
Uninterrupted median street trees are recommended along Island Crest at approximately 30 feet on center from SE 40th to approximately SE 42nd of a type mentioned in b. above, providing left turn traffic can be accommodated.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_014.png>]
Occasional medians to allow left turns to cross-streets are feasible from Merrimount Dr. south to SE 53rd Pl. Planting is recommended to be informal clusters of trees common to the Island and complementary to the natural forest edge on the west side of the arterial.
Informal cluster planting in the planting strips is recommended for both sides of the right-of-way, with occasional groupings of ornamental or flowering trees. Plant material should be located so as to best delineate the roadway, buffer adjoining housing, and reinforce the existing vegetation.
An alternate of street trees at approximately 30 feet on center should be considered from SE 40th to Merrimount Dr., in order to define the roadway along this stretch which is significantly devoid of trees, particularly along the east side. In this case, the informal cluster median planting would commence just south of Merrimount Dr.
Particular attention should be given to the selection of plant material along the west edge of the right-of-way, for it should reinforce the remaining natural forest edge, i.e., big leaf maple, Douglas fir, western red cedar, and bitter cherry.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_015.png>]
Groundcovers should be native to the Island and relatively maintenance free, such as ivy, salal, and red fescue field grass. Wherever right-of-way groundcover areas adjoin private property, effort should be made to achieve a pleasing transition by the use of compatible materials or if appropriate, by the extension of the adjoining groundcover areas within the right-of-way.
f.SE 53rd Place: Route 9, western portion of section 9/20 only.
This western portion of SE 53rd Pl. should be developed in keeping with upper 53rd Pl. as a shared right-of-way or it may be developed to accommodate a bicycle path or lane. Pedestrian lanes or paths should be extended to West Mercer Way.
Particular care should be taken to insure that vegetation cover is restored along this right-of-way and all bank cuts properly replanted. It is recommended that informal cluster planting be utilized within the right-of-way as well as any easements obtained for planting purposes. Attention should be given to maximum screening of residential driveways in order to maintain continuity with the rural portions of 53rd Pl. to the east. Natural groundcovers in keeping with adjoining properties should be extended to the edge of the pavement and pedestrian pathway or lane.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_016.png>]
g.SE 68th Street, 84th Ave. SE and SE 72nd Street: Route 10, sections 10/20 and 10/30.
A joint bicycle /pedestrian path or separated bicycle and pedestrian paths are recommended for the south side of SE 68th, adjoining the shopping center. The former could very easily be accommodated within the right-of-way without relocation of existing roadway, whereas an easement would be necessary to implement the latter under the same conditions. The separate pathway system is recommended for consideration since it would leave the natural edge of Pioneer Park undisturbed which may in time develop into a pedestrian pathway network similar to that now existing along Island Crest Park, and it would concentrate the pedestrian/bicycle activity adjacent to the shopping center.
A joint bicycle/pedestrian lane is recommended along the east side of 84th SE, to facilitate access to the shopping center and to serve the Junior High School. This may be extended as a path or lane along the south side of SE 72nd to West Mercer Way, or an alternate may be used of an uphill bicycle/pedestrian lane with shared use of the right-of-way for downhill bicycle traffic.
Street trees are recommended for the south side of SE 68th. Trees may be at approximately 30 feet on center and of the standard street tree types as mentioned in b. above, or may be informally planted in the planting strips separating the roadway and the bicycle and pedestrian facilities in keeping with Pioneer Park. Special care should be taken to maintain and reinforce the tree cover along Pioneer Park.
Median street trees and planter strip trees are suggested along both sides of 84th SE at approximately 30 feet on center from the eastern driveway of the school to SE 68th, with ivy or native grass suggested for use as groundcover. Street trees may be planted an the property line bordering the sidewalk along the west side of 84th SE without disrupting the existing sidewalk.
SE 72nd is suggested for informal cluster planting along the strip separating the roadway and the pedestrian or bicycle/pedestrian lane along the south side. Groundcovers should be in keeping with adjoining properties as in e. above.
h.SE 70th Place: Route 10, eastern portion of section 10/10.
Along SE 70th Pl. the bicycle/pedestrian facilities should be treated as an extension of upper SE 68th, that is a shared right-of-way or a minimal bicycle path along the south side, or the alternate use of the right-of-way along 92nd SE as a means of connecting to East Mercer Way.
Pedestrian paths or lanes are suggested for lower SE 70th Pl.
Special attention is directed to lower SE 70th Pl. where much of the tree cover has been recently lost. Informal cluster planting of native trees is suggested along this portion as a means of partially screening the adjoining housing and delineating the roadway. Native groundcovers should be extended to the edge of the roadway and adjoining pedestrian paths and lanes.
i.Merrimount Drive: Route 8
A shared right-of-way, or an alternate of a bicycle lane, to accommodate downhill traffic is recommended for Merrimount Dr. A combination of pedestrian paths or lanes could be implemented along one side of the right-of-way.
Use of native materials such as big leaf maple, western red cedar, bitter cherry, etc., is recommended along this right-of-way as a means of extending the natural forest edge which now dominates at the northwest intersection with Island Crest.
Planting of native groundcovers within the right-of-way is suggested as a means of further delineating the road and pathways. These should be planted to the roadway edge.
j.Portions of Mercer Ways: Route 2, northern half of section 2/10; portions of route 6, sections 6/20 and 6/40; route 5 segment of section 5/10.
Bicycle/pedestrian facilities should be developed in keeping with the adjoining rural portions of the right-of-way with particular attention given to the need for pedestrian and bicycle paths in areas where school traffic must be accommodated.
The segments of Mercer Ways classified as suburban are lacking tree cover enclosure and are very apparent disruptions to the continuity of the rural roadway experience. Planting is of particular necessity along these segments. It should reinforce the remaining forest edge where this is appropriate and in the more developed areas such as section 2/10, informal cluster planting of native materials is recommended as in c. above.
Of particular concern is the lack of landscaping in that portion of the East Mercer right-of-way directly adjoining the Mercerwood Shore Club, which is currently entirely paved and in need of a generous planting buffer in order to screen the pavement expanse of the Club’s tennis courts directly below the right-of-way.
URBAN RIGHT-OF-WAYS: Island Crest from SE 40th to I-90, route 1, section 1/10. All other urban arterials are covered in the Business Section.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_017.png>]
GOAL:
Soften and breakdown the apparent scale of the roadway in order to make it more compatible with the natural Island environment.
INTENT:
1.Retain and reinforce the natural wooded hillside perimeter as part of the bowl-like enclosure for the Business District.
2.Treat Island Crest as the major gateway to the Island.
3.Facilitate pedestrian movement to the Business District from the surrounding apartment community.
CRITERIA:
1a.Consider the use of median and planter strip trees along Island Crest at approximately 30 feet on center from SE 40th to the I-90 interchange with particular care given to the appearance of the roadway from the adjoining apartment community as well as the preservation of the existing views to Lake Washington both from the roadway and the adjoining apartments.
2a.Consider screening the existing guardrail along the western edge of Island Crest by plant material hedging such as laurel, holly, yew, etc.
2b.Generous plant material buffers are recommended along the I-90/Island Crest interchange just north of SE 34th, as a means of buffering the adjoining Business District and apartment community and providing a greenbelt transition zone to the street through planting proposed above.
2c-3a. Maintain a narrow planter strip east of the existing sidewalk along the east side of Island Crest in order to provide a uniform planting buffer of ivy or similar vines along the rockery and retaining walls adjoining the sidewalk. Consider increasing the width of this sidewalk to 6 feet to facilitate pedestrian access to the Business District.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_018.png>]
3b.Encourage a pedestrian crossing at SE 30th or SE 32nd as a means of providing pedestrian access to the Business District in keeping with the sidewalk-street tree concepts outlined in that section.
3c.Lighting should provide general illumination to the right-of-way corridor, be pleasing to the pedestrian, and of such intensity as to prevent area-wide lighting or disruption of the general view from the adjoining apartment community. Lighting standards should not exceed 24 feet in height and should be the same type of standard used in the Business District or compatible with it. (Also see Public Signing, Lighting and Other Street Furniture).

PUBLIC SIGNING, LIGHTING AND OTHER STREET FURNITURE.
CONCEPTS
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_020.png>]
Public signing, street furniture and lighting elements should reinforce and clarify the predominantly natural, informal, residential character of the Island instead of dominating or detracting from it. Appropriate street furnishings can do much to make the Island environment more legible, expressive, pleasant and engaging as well as establish a “sense of place” about the Island as a whole or a particular area within it. Public signing can more effectively and uniformly reveal the function, form and activities of the Island and clarify its overall environment. “Out-of-control” signing, lighting and furnishings – ones that are in conflict with the surroundings – obscure the meaning of the environment as often as they clarify it.
Public signing, street furniture and lighting should be evaluated on the basis of 1) does it detract from the overall environment and 2) does it provide the type of information which clarifies and reinforces the environment of Mercer Island and provides the necessary guidance and orientation to the user.
GUIDELINES
Public Signing
Shape and color are the primary means of distinguishing the type of message for the driver in motion. The basic shapes are 1) the circle: mandatory rules; 2) the rectangle: guidance, speed regulations, and curb usage; and 3) the diamond: warning. Two nonconforming signs are the octagonal “stop” sign and the triangular “yield” sign.
Shape combined with color indicate a specific class of message. The red circle is used for prohibiting signs, i.e., no entry, no parking, etc. The green circle is used for permitted turning rules. The yellow diamond indicates warning. Blue rectangles give local guidance and green rectangles are used for distant guidance.
The use of symbolic signs as patterned after the international traffic symbols is gaining acceptance in this country. The 1971 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices shows increased reliance on symbols with minimal word use as a transition toward a more uniform and better understood system of symbolic signing. There is no doubt that symbols, once accepted by the general public, offer greater clarity and legibility than the current, lengthy verbal directives in use. Because properly designed symbolic signing is more readily perceived and comprehended than its verbal counterpart, the number of necessary signs may be significantly reduced.
Mercer Island is, in a sense, a fairly remote community that does not receive a great deal of outside traffic, and for this reason has the need for relatively few public signs as compared to a community such as Burien or Renton which cater to a great number of outside visitors. This has a distinct advantage not only in keeping signs to a minimum, but also in introducing changes to an existing signing system.
Curb Usage Signs
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_021.png>]
Curb usage signs (no parking, bus stop, loading, etc.) although classified as Regulatory Signs, are not as important to traffic safety as other regulatory and warning signs, and thus offer a chance to introduce purely symbolic signing without compromising user safety.
The diagonally slashed red circle is an internationally accepted prohibitive symbol and is included in the Manual as acceptable signing for prohibiting truck and bicycle entry. The slashed circle, in conjunction with perhaps limited wording, may be used as the basis for most of the curb usage signing needed, within the Business District. (See diagrams.)
Warning Signs
Warning signs are primarily placed for the protection of the driver who may not be acquainted with the road conditions which may be potentially dangerous. Warning signs indicate crossings, curves, impending signals, slippery conditions etc. The majority of warning signs are diamond shaped with a black legend and yellow background. They are often used in conjunction with a rectangular verbal guidance sign.
Other Regulatory Signs
Other than the curb usage signs previously discussed, the major regulatory signs applicable to the Island are the stop, yield, speed limit, and turning signs. (See diagrams.) The signing for I-90 is not addressed by these guidelines.
Guide Signs
Guide signs are used to inform the motorist of interesting routes, destination, parks, trails, historic sites, etc. Because of the great familiarity of most users with the Island and its facilities, most standard guide signs are not needed on the Island and their use should be discouraged in order to maintain roadside signs to a minimum.
GUIDELINES
GOAL:
Encourage the development and use of an overall, uniform signing system in keeping with national safety standards and representative of the Island Community that will:
INTENT:
1.Emphasize symbols as opposed to the worded message.
2.Lend itself to combined or joint mounting so that the overall numbers of separate parts and separate signs may be reduced.
3.Lend itself to a uniform system of mounting.
4.Utilize light standards as supports for signing and light signalization where appropriate.
5.Be legible at the speed and distance at which it is placed to be seen.
6.Employ minimum sizes as determined by safety requirements.
CRITERIA:
Curb Usage Signs: Curb usage signs pertain mostly to the Business District. There are various other locations on the Island where “no parking” signs are used, but they are relatively few. Bus zone symbols may be used Island wide. Stopping or standing regulations may be particularly applicable at schools and other public facilities.
The spacing of “no parking” signs should not exceed 150 feet, and should in all cases be governed by what is a reasonable sight distance in each particular situation. “No parking” signs should be placed so that they are readily apparent from cross streets that enter in mid-block. Signs may occur at random spacing as determined by visibility and available mounting. Within the Business District, two signs per block may suffice.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_022.png>]
Parking and other curb usage signs should be incorporated as part of the signing mounted on light standards within the Business District and in all other locations where possible in order to keep the number of upright posts at a minimum. The “no parking” sign/symbol may be the dominant element on all curb usage signs, with other uses such as truck load, bus zone, taxis only, etc., indicated by word message as part of the “no parking” sign. Symbols may be used to specifically indicate the permitted usage for a bus zone, taxi zone, etc., that are based on the open green circle which is the standard symbol signifying permitted use.
An alternative approach to posting “no parking” areas within the Business District would be to post only those limited areas where parking is allowed, providing a general “no on-street parking” sign/symbol is adequately displayed or incorporated as part of the gateway signing at key entry points to the Business District. In this case the positive green circle would be the basic symbol employed.
“No parking” designations within the Business District may also be incorporated by means of curb markings, striping, or by the use of the slashed red circle symbol as part of the curb shoulder. In this case the “no parking” designation should be used at approximately 40-50 foot intervals.
Reflector buttons for medians should be made a part of the curb. Use of upright reflector mounts should be discouraged.
Warning Signs: The use of warning signs should be kept to a minimum because their unnecessary use tends to lessen their impact. This is particularly true in the case of Mercer Island where the majority of motorists are very familiar with existing conditions. Low speeds, as well as a uniform, consistent, uncomplicated backdrop, such as that along the majority of the right-of-ways, present additional reasons for further reducing warning sign usage and sign size.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_023.png>]
The color coding and diamond outline are of particular importance for easy identification of these signs, while the image in this case is of secondary importance.
Wherever safety considerations permit, the size of all signs and accompanying verbal guidance should be reduced in size as permitted by the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control. Use of symbols that offer greater legibility along with smaller size should be employed. Warning signs for trail crossings should be combined with actual trail signs wherever possible, particularly along the rural right-of-ways. The incorporation of the diamond warning symbol and verbal guidance message as a part of a rectangular background should be considered for it has distinct advantages for establishing a uniform mounting system and for the incorporation of additional signs.
Regulatory Signs: The majority of regulatory signs are rectangular with the long axis being vertical. Two notable exceptions are the octagonal “stop” sign and the triangular “yield” sign. Minimum size standards have been established for both “stop” and “yield” signs which are permitted on low volume local streets and secondary roads. These should be employed throughout the Island.
Where their use is necessary, turning signs should employ the green circle with arrow symbol as opposed to the purely verbal black and white signs. Turn prohibition signs should employ the red circle.
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_024.png>]
Speed limit signs should be kept at minimum permitted sizes, and where permissible they should be combined with other roadside signing.
Guide Signs: The only guide sign currently in use is the bicycle route sign marking an officially designated bicycle trail. The use of these signs will most likely increase as new bicycle trails and types of facilities are developed. New symbolic signing may be developed for bicycle route markers as well as designated viewpoints or trailheads. Signing should be kept at minimum sizes, used only where essential to differentiate the facility or identify its location, and mounted jointly with other signing wherever possible.
Mounting: All signing should be uniformly mounted. Signs should be mounted in conjunction with lighting standards and should be integrated with other signing wherever possible. Signs should be mounted in conformity with height and setback requirements. Upright posts should be of wood, stained in dark or neutral colors. The back sides of all one-face reading signs and metal mounting frames should be anodized or painted to closely match the color of the wood.
Street Name Signs: A distinct, well designed system of street name signing could do much to give Mercer Island special identity. The mounting and upright post should be compatible with that used for other public signing. The letter type should be picked for legibility and clarity. Value contrast as opposed to color should be emphasized to facilitate readability. Another alternative would be to incorporate the message “dead end” or an appropriate symbol as part of the street name sign with no change in color. A graphic symbol that is representative of the Island could be incorporated into all street name signs and used consistently to graphically convey “Mercer Island” in other locations, such as the gateway signing to the Business District.
An alternate to the use of the diamond “dead end” signs could be the color coding of street name signs for those streets that terminate as dead ends. For example, all through street name signs could be dark brown with white lettering; all “dead end” name signs could be signal yellow with black lettering.
Crosswalks: The major pedestrian crosswalks within the Business District should be indicated by a differentiation of pavement as opposed to striping. The pavement should be complementary to that used for adjoining sidewalks as well as pavement within the future town square which the majority of these crossings adjoin. It is the intent that paving within the town square as well as other pedestrian precincts, be of a unit type material such as concrete pavers, brick, tile, etc.
Lighting
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_025.png>]
GOAL:
Provide safety for vehicular traffic and pedestrians.
INTENT:
Provide the amount and quality of light as recommended by recognized standards while satisfying the other goals included here. Within the Business District an average of 1.2 f.c. may be used, which is the IES Handbook recommendation for “major” roadways in business districts not classified as downtowns. An average rating is not significant. The minimum level and contrast between minimum and maximum as perceived over time is more important, particularly along the rural right-of-ways. Incident light along commercial streets is a significant contributor to the amount of light perceived by the driver or pedestrian and should be considered as part of the overall light level.
CRITERIA:
[IMAGE: <19AppxC_026.png>]
a.Light Levels: The minimum light level provided by street lights within the Business District at a point furthest away from the light source should not be less than .2 f.c. and the maximum should not exceed about 5 f.c., the average level.of light should be approximately 1.2 f.c. to 2 f.c. including a maintenance factor of 60 percent.
b.Increase lighting levels at intersections, crosswalks and driveways to 2 times minimum, that of the remainder of the street or about 4 f.c. average at intersections within the Business District. Light should be uniform at intersections and of a contrasting color to mid-block areas.
GOAL:
Enhance the directional quality of the street.
INTENT:
1.Give character and scale to the street and emphasize the street corridor’s directional quality through lighting pattern, scale of the light standards, and increased light levels at points of increased decision making for the driver.
2.Reduce area wide lighting and restrict it to the corridor.
3.Focus on the enhancement of the landscape and reinforce one’s perception of the streetscape as a continuum of related elements building a total image.
CRITERIA:
1a.Emphasize the street as a corridor by focusing the lighting totally on the street and pedestrian ways. Minimize spilling-over light onto adjacent properties, except at driveways.
1b.At intersections and along major pedestrian routes in the Business District add pedestrian lighting integrated with the street lighting system. Light fixtures should be at a comfortable height to the pedestrian, approximately 10-15 feet high.
1c.Emphasize the lighting at intersections by changing the color of the light to warmer tones either by changing the type of lamp or the color of the lens.
2.Lighting standards should be not more than 20-24 feet high between intersections and 28-33 feet high at intersections in the Business District and along urban right-of-ways. Rural right-of-way standards should not exceed 16 feet; suburban right-of-ways should not exceed 22 feet. The lighting fixtures and standards are elements of a continuum of parts constituting the streetscape including trees, signs, roadway, automobile and people, which together form a spatial territory. Subjectively, not measurably, if the lights are raised above their critical heights they go beyond the bounds of the territory, break the tension formed between parts, and dis-associate themselves from the other elements. The road user at this point no longer perceives the lights as a cooperative part of the total streetscape.
3a.Placement of lights should complement street tree spacing.
3b.Light underneath portions of the trees with approximately 10 percent up-light of the street lighting system. (This portion may be increased as the trees mature).
GOAL:
Relate lighting to other public elements of the street.
INTENT:
Reduce the number of competing elements in the streetscape and through integrated design, relate, in terms of common or complementary materials, systems and scale, the lighting system to traffic signals, signing and street furniture.
CRITERIA:
a.Combine the traffic signals on the same standard or standard system as the general intersection lighting.
b.Integrate signing, street signing and directional signals with the lighting standards throughout the Business District, at major intersections and at other locations if appropriate.
c.All light standards should be of the same material, preferably wood.
d.Overhead traffic signalization should be kept at a minimum.
Street Furniture
GOAL:
Develop furnishings that are compatible and consistent with the surrounding “streetscape” and the overall Island environment.
INTENT:
1.Provide appropriate street furnishings where needed.
2.Encourage pedestrian use of the right-of-way.
3.Enhance the street scene.
CRITERIA:
The street furniture elements addressed by these guidelines are bus shelters, seating, guardrails, bollards, fire hydrants, signal control boxes, and trash receptacles.
Bus Shelters: Bus shelters should be installed at major collecting points where sufficient use justifies their location or at locations that are served by several transit routes. Joint use between public and school transit stops should be encouraged. Bus shelters should not occur on highly developed residential streets or restricted right-of-ways where they may infringe on adjoining private development. Shelters should be sited to give easy access and visibility of the right-of-way, protection from prevailing weather, rain, and sun. Seating should be incorporated as part of the shelter. For the Business District or at other major locations, appropriate trash receptacles should be provided.
The existing bus shelter in the 4800 Block of East Mercer Way is an excellent example of a rural shelter in terms of materials, scale, color, and orientation. It is of a sufficient size to provide adequate protection from the weather. It incorporates seating. Its roof form is pleasing and in keeping with residential housing, and it has a sense of overhead structure that implies “shelter”. The scale and color of the structure are good due to the use of natural unit materials. The above criteria should be applied to the development of future bus shelters or a prototype shelter for the Island.
Bus stop locations within the Business District should be located to take advantage of the existing shelter and seating provided by adjoining buildings, such as the National Bank of Commerce. This particular type of pedestrian oriented street frontage development should be encouraged throughout the District, in which case the bus shelters would not be a necessity. The location of separate shelters within the Business District, as it exists, may only reinforce the preponderance of very small structures and very large parking lots.
Seating: Seating may be incorporated into the proposed joint pedestrian/bicycle paths proposed along arterials such as Island Crest Way to serve transit and school bus patrons, or as resting stops for bicyclists, pedestrians, etc. Care should be taken to locate seating sufficiently set back from the roadway and in areas where it does not conflict with adjoining development. Materials should be of wood, either natural or stained in dark or neutral colors.
Guardrails: Guardrails that are used for street ends, undeveloped right-of-ways, and other similar locations where their use is more symbolic than safety-oriented should be of wood, either natural or stained in dark or neutral colors. Reflector buttons may be incorporated as part of the guardrail for night-time visibility.
In locations where wood guardrails do not suffice because of safety requirements, a planting hedge may be employed as a visual screening device. Where screening is not feasible corten may be employed as the rail. If existing speed limits are maintained on the Island, the use of such guardrails should be limited to Island Crest Way and I-90.
Bollards: Bollards may be used for marking street ends, roadways, and undeveloped right-of-ways particularly where unimpeded pedestrian traffic is desirable. Bollards may be used as a means of separating bicycle and vehicular traffic where curbing is not appropriate, and may be employed at intersections that are crossed by bicycle paths/lanes as a means of preventing vehicle entry. Bollards should be of wood, either natural or stained in dark or neutral colors.
Bollards used for the protection of fire hydrants should be left as natural concrete with the use of reflector buttons for night-time visibility. The use of bollards to protect stop signs or other signage posts should be kept to a minimum; where bollards are absolutely essential for safety purposes, they should be treated as above.
Fire Hydrant: Hydrants should be uniformly painted. Hydrants within the Business District should be undergrounded.
Signal Control Boxes: Control boxes should be located to allow screening by planting buffers.
Trash Receptacles: Trash receptacles should be incorporated as part of the overall streetscape elements. Their main use would be in the Business District, at bus stops and shelters, and other public facilities. Receptacles should be of a size that does not dominate the streetscape elements, and should conform to the State Litter Control Law. They should be attached to existing light standards or other appropriate elements, and should be free of the ground. Metal, perforated metal, or wire mesh may be used. Color may be chosen to blend with existing street elements or used as a contrast to them,
