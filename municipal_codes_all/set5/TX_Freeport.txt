PREAMBLE



   We, the citizens of Freeport, Texas, in order to provide for the future

self-government, do hereby adopt this Home Rule Charter in accordance with
the statutes of the State of Texas; do hereby declare the residents of the
City of Freeport in Brazoria County, Texas, living within the legally
established boundaries of the said City, to be a political subdivision of the
State of Texas incorporated forever under the name and style of the “City
of Freeport” with such powers, rights, and duties as are herein provided.



ARTICLE 1.  FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND BOUNDARIES



SECTION 1.01.  FORM OF GOVERNMENT.



   The municipal government provided by this Charter shall be known as the
“Council-Manager Government.” Pursuant to its provisions and subject only
to the limitations imposed by the State Constitution, the statutes of this
State and by this Charter, all powers of the City shall be vested in an
elective Council, hereinafter referred to as the “City Council,” which
shall enact local legislation, adopt budgets, determine policies and appoint
the City Manager, who in turn shall be held responsible to the City Council
for the execution of the laws and the administration of the government of the
City. All powers of the City shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by

State.



SECTION 1.02.  BOUNDARIES.



   The boundaries of the City of Freeport shall be the same as have
heretofore been established and as they existed on the 25th day of April,

lying adjacent to the City, with or without the consent of the territory and
the inhabitants annexed, any such annexation being in accordance with the
provisions of the Municipal Annexation Act codified as Chapter 43 of the

Council may, upon a petition signed by a majority of the qualified voters
residing in such territory if the same be inhabited, or without any such
petition if the same be uninhabited, by ordinance duly passed, discontinue
said territory as part of said City; said petition and ordinance shall
specify accurately the metes and bounds of the territory sought to be
eliminated from the City and shall contain a plat designating such territory
so that the same can be definitely ascertained; and when said ordinance has
been duly passed  the  same  shall be  entered  upon the minutes and
records of said City, and from and after the entry of such ordinance said
territory shall cease to be a part of said City, but said territory shall
still be liable for its pro rata share of any debts incurred while said area
was a part of said City, and the City shall continue to levy, assess and
collect taxes on the property within said territory to pay the indebtedness
incurred while said area was a part of the City as though the same had not
been excluded from the boundaries of the City.

SECTION 10.07.  CONSENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS.



   The consent of abutting and adjacent property owners shall not be
required for the construction, extension, maintenance or operation of any
public utility; but such abutting and adjacent property shall thereafter be
restored to its previous condition and nothing in this Charter or in any
franchise granted hereunder shall ever be construed to deprive any such
property owner of any right of action for damage or injury to his or her
property as now or hereafter provided by law.

in imposing terms and conditions as may be reasonable in connection with any
franchise grant.



SECTION 10.10.  ACCOUNTS OF MUNICIPALLY-OWNED UTILITIES.

such City ownership and operation, including all assets and all liabilities,
appropriately subdivided by classes, depreciation reserve, other reserves and
surplus; also revenues, operating expenses including depreciation, interest
payments, rental, and other disposition of annual income. The accounts shall
show actual capital cost to the City of each public utility owned, also the

therefor the person or persons claiming such damages shall within thirty (30)
days after the death of the injured person give notice as above required in
case of personal injury. Provided, however, that nothing therein contained

SECTION 11.13.  CHARTER REVIEW COMMISSION.



   The City Council shall appoint at its first regular meeting in June in
each odd numbered year, a Charter Review Commission of five citizens of the
City of Freeport.



   (a)   Duties of the Commission: It shall be the duty of such Charter
review Commission to:



      (1)   Inquire into the operation of the City Government under
the Charter provisions and determine whether any such provisions require
revision. To this end public hearings may be held; and the Commission shall
have the power to compel the attendance of any officer or employee of the
City and to require the submission of any of the City records which it may
deem necessary to the conduct of such hearing;



      (2)   Propose any recommendations it may deem desirable to
insure compliance with the provisions of the Charter by the several
departments of the City Government;



      (3)   Propose, if it deems desirable, amendments to this
Charter to improve the effective application of said Charter to current
conditions;



      (4)   Report its finding and present its proposed amendments,
if any, to the City Council.



   (b)   Action by the City Council: The City Council shall receive and
have published in the official newspaper of the City any report presented by
the Charter Review Commission, shall consider any recommendations made, and

order such amendment or amendments to be submitted to the voters of the City
in the manner provided by Chapter 9 of the Local Government Code, as now or
hereafter amended.



(Amendment adopted by electorate 5-2-98)



   (c)   Term of Office: The term of office of such Charter Review
Commission shall be six months, and, if during such term no report is
presented to the City Council, then all records of the proceedings of such
Commission shall be filed with the person performing the duties of City
Secretary and shall become a public record.



(Election of 4-3-82)



SECTION 11.14.  SUBMISSION OF CHARTER TO VOTERS.



   The Charter Commission in preparing this Charter finds and decides that
it is impracticable to segregate each subject so as to permit a vote of
“yes” or “no” on the same, for the reason that the Charter is so
constructed that in order to enable it to work and function, it is necessary
that it should be adopted in its entirety. For these reasons, the Charter
Commission directs that the said Charter be voted upon as a whole and that it
shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Freeport at an
election to be held for that purpose on the 18th day of June, 1960. Not less
than thirty (30) days prior to such election, the City Council shall cause
the City Secretary to mail a copy of this Charter to each qualified voter of
the City of Freeport as appears from the latest tax collector's roll. If a
majority of the qualified voters voting in such election shall vote in favor
of the adoption of this Charter, it shall become the Charter of the City of
Freeport, and after the returns have been canvassed, the same shall be
declared adopted and the City Secretary shall file an official copy of the
Charter with the records of the City. The Secretary shall furnish the Mayor a
copy of said Charter, which copy of the Charter so adopted, authenticated and
certified by his signature and the seal of the City, shall be forwarded by
the Mayor to the Secretary of State of the State of Texas and shall show the
approval of such Charter by majority vote of the qualified voters voting at
such election.



SECTION 11.15.  GENDER NEUTRAL PROVISION.



   Whenever in this Charter the pronouns he, him or his standing alone are
used, such pronouns shall be construed to mean he or she, him or her and his
or hers.



(Amendment adopted by electorate 5-15-18)



    We, the undersigned members of the Freeport Charter Commission,
heretofore duly elected to prepare a Charter for the City of Freeport, Texas,
do hereby certify that this publication constitutes a true copy of the
proposed Charter for the City of Freeport, Texas, as adopted unanimously by
the members hereof.

ordinance, the officer may prepare in triplicate a written notice directing
that person to appear before the municipal court of the city, containing the
name and address of the person, the provision alleged to have been violated,
the date and location of such violation, the time and place when and where
the person so notified shall appear in such court, and such other matters as
the officer may deem appropriate. The time within which a person shall be
directed to so appear specified in the notice must be at least ten days after
the date of the issuance of the notice unless the person shall request an
earlier hearing. In order to prevent an arrest for the violation specified in

in such court by signing in triplicate the written notice. A copy of the
notice shall be delivered to the person, a copy shall be retained by the

the judge of such court or the clerk thereof. When the person has appeared as
directed in the notice, all proceedings in such court shall be the same as if
a warrant for the person's arrest had been duly issued and returned executed.
The notice to appear may serve as the written complaint as provided in Tex.
Crim. Proc. Code Art. 27.14(d), to which the person may plead 'guilty' or
'nolo contendere'; but if the person pleads 'not guilty' to the violation, a
complaint shall be filed that conforms to the requirements of Tex. Crim.
Proc. Code Ch. 45, unless the person waives the filing of a sworn complaint
and elects that the prosecution proceed on the notice alone by agreeing
thereto in writing with the prosecution, signing such agreement and filing it
with the court.

discharge of pollutants at an existing source; or



         (c)   The production or wastewater generating processes
of the building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially
independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether
these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the
new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which
the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the
existing source, should be considered.



      (2)   Construction on a site at which an existing source is
located results in a modification rather than a new source if the
construction does not create a new building, structure, facility, or
installa- tion meeting the criteria of divisions (1)(b) or (1)(c) above but
otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or production
equipment.



      (3)   Construction of a new source as defined under this
division has commenced if the owner or operator has:



         (a)   Begun, or caused to begin as part of a continuous

            1.   Any placement, assembly, or installation of
facilities or equipment;



            2.   Significant site preparation work including
clearing, excavation, or removal of existing buildings, structures, or
facilities which is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of
new source facilities or equipment; or



         (b)   Entered into a binding contractual obligation for
the purchase of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its
operation within a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which
can be terminated or modified without substantial loss, and contracts for
feasibility, engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual
obligation under this division.

POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or
any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.



   (B)   Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:



      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in
the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup
flashpoint of less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40
CFR 261.21;

solids greater than ½ in any dimension;



      (4)   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD,
etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration
which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause
interference with the POTW;



      (5)   Wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit
biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in
no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the
treatment plant to exceed 104°F (40°C) unless the approval authority, upon
the request of the POTW, approves alternate temperature limits;



      (6)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or
products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or

(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.011  FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.



   The national categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter
I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated.



   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater,
the city may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.6(c).



   (B)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard
is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city shall
impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR
403.6(e).



   (C)   A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive
provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are
fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing
the categorical pretreatment standard.



   (D)   A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.012  STATE REQUIREMENTS.



   State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be
met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which
they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those
in this chapter or other applicable ordinance or provision of this code.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.013  LOCAL NUMERICAL SPECIFIC POLLUTANT LIMITS.



   (A)   The following pollutant limits are estab- lished to protect
against pass through and interference of the city's wastewater treatment
plant. No person shall discharge wastewater containing pollutants in excess
of the following instantaneous maximum pollutant concentrations listed in
division (D) of this section unless authorized by wastewater discharge
permits issued by the city. These limits apply at the point where the
wastewater enters the city's sewer collection system (end-of-pipe). All
concentrations for metallic substances are for “Total Metals” unless
indicated otherwise.



   (B)   Users required to obtain wastewater discharge permits shall
receive mass allocations of the maximum allowable headworks loading for each
known or suspected pollutants in the treated or untreated wastestream based
on the treatment capacity of the city's wastewater treatment plant. The city
shall reserve sufficient treatment capacity for residential and commercial
users of the city's sewer system and shall allocate a proportion of the
remaining treatment capacity to the industrial users of the system. The city
shall make pollutant allocations based on mass. The Pretreatment Coordinator
shall determine the mass allocation for permitted industrial users in
accordance with the Industrial Pretreatment Implementation Procedures.



   (C)   Conventional pollutants, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and
total suspended solids (TSS), and non-conventional pollutants (organic
compounds and unlisted metals) may be regulated by wastewater discharge
permit if the user has the potential, either by volume and/or concentration,
to cause pass through or inhibition at the city wastewater treatment plant,
reduction in biosolids quality, or creates a heath or safety risk. Permit
limits for these pollutants may be based on concentration or mass.



   (D)   Maximum pollutant concentrations.

applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.014  CITY'S RIGHT OF REVISION.



   The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to
the POTW.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.015  SPECIAL AGREEMENT.



   The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users
setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no
case will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical
pretreatment standard or federal pretreat- ment requirement. However, the
user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the
categorical pretreatment standard from the Approval Authority in accordance
with 403.13.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.016  DILUTION.



   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable
pretreatment standard or require- ment. The city may impose mass limitations
on users which he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.017  PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.



   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treat- ment as required to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within the
time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the city, whichever is
more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be
acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of
such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.018  DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   Existing users.  Compliance by existing users covered by
categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date
the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in
the appropriate standard. The city shall establish a final compliance
deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment
standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are
more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment standards.



   (B)   New users.  New source dischargers and “new users” are
required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest
feasible time (not to exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge). New
sources and “new users” shall install and have in operating condition,
and shall “start-up” all pollution control equipment required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.



   (C)   Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user
shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in
EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a
categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is
in non-compliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance
schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit to insure compliance
within the shortest time feasible.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.019  ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.



   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.



   (B)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in
the opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed,
by the user at his expense.



   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may
be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.020  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE; SLUG CONTROL PLANS.



   (A)   The city may require any user to develop and implement an
accidental discharge/slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the city,
facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants
shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An
accidental spill prevention plan/slug control plan showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
city for review and approval before implementation.



   (B)   The city shall determine which user is required to develop a
plan and require said plan to be submitted within 90 days after notification
by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified
after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve
the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet
the requirements of this section.



   (C)   Any user required to develop and implement an accidental
discharge/control slug plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a
minimum, the following:



      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including
non-routine batch discharges;



      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;



      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any
accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any
discharge; which would violate any of the standards in §§ 51.010 through
51.013; and



      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental
or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading opera- tions, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures
and equipment for emergency response.



   (D)   Users shall notify the city wastewater treatment plant
immediately upon the occurrence of a “slug” or “accidental discharge”
of substances regulated by this chapter. The notification shall include
location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration
and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any
expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines
imposed on the city on account thereof under state or federal law.



   (E)   Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user

without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the city. Any
violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall
be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge
permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater
discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply
with all federal and state pretreatment standards or require- ments or with
any other requirements of federal, state, and local law. The city may require
other users, including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge
permits (as necessary) to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.072  PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORT.



   (A)   Any user that is required to have an industrial waste
discharge permit and performs self-monitoring shall submit to the city during
the months of June and December, unless required on other dates or more
frequently by the city, a report indicating the nature of the effluent over
the previous reporting period. The frequency of monitoring shall be as
prescribed within the industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users
shall sample their industrial waste discharge permit. At a minimum, users
shall sample their discharge at least twice per year.



   (B)   The report shall include a record of the concentrations (and
mass if specified in the waste- water discharge permit) of the pollutants
listed in the wastewater discharge permit that were measured and a record of
all flow measurements (average and maximum) taken at the designated sampling
locations, and shall also include any additional information required by this
chapter or the wastewater discharge permit. Production data shall be reported
if required by the wastewater discharge permit. Both daily maximum and
average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. If a user
sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required by the city or by
this chapter, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all
results of sampling and analysis of the discharge during the reporting period.



   (C)   Any user subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the city or by unit production limits specified in the
applicable categorical standards, shall report production data as outlined in
§ 51.071(B).



   (D)   If the city calculated limits to factor out dilution flows or
non-regulated flows, the user will be responsible for providing flows from
the regulated process flows, dilution flows and non-regulated flows.



   (E)   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement;
provided, however, that the city may accept reports of average and maximum
flows estimated by verifiable techniques if the city determines that an
actual measurement is not feasible.



   (F)   Sampling shall be representative of the user's daily
operations and shall be taken in accordance with the requirements specified
in §§ 51.100 through 51.102.



   (G)   The city may require reporting by users that are not required
to have an industrial wastewater discharge permit if information or data is
needed to establish a sewer charge, determine the treatability of the
effluent or determine any other factor which is related to the operation and
maintenance of the sewer system.



   (H)   The city may require self-monitoring by the user or, if
requested by the user, may agree to perform the periodic compliance
monitoring needed to prepare the periodic compliance report required under
this section. If the city agrees to perform such periodic compliance
monitoring, it may charge the user for such monitoring, based upon the costs
incurred by the city for the sampling and analyses. Any such charges shall be
added to the normal sewer charge and shall be payable as part of the sewer
bills. The city is under no obligation to perform periodic compliance
monitoring for a user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.073  COMPLIANCE, SCHEDULES FOR MEETING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT
STANDARDS.



   (A)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
con- struction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user
to meet the applicable pre- treatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for
major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.).



   (B)   No increment referred to in division (A) of this section shall
exceed nine months.



   (C)   Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the
city including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects
to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the
steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.074  NOTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION CHANGES.



   Any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating
equivalent mass or concentration limits shall notify the city within two
business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the
production level will significantly change within the next calendar month.
Any user not providing a notice of such anticipated change will be required
to comply with the existing limits contained in its wastewater discharge
permit.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.075  HAZARDOUS WASTE NOTIFICATION.



   (A)   Any user that is discharging 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes
as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar
month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required provide a one time
notification in writing to the city, EPA Regional Waste Manage- ment Division
Director, and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC)
Hazardous Waste Division. Any existing user exempt from this notification,
shall comply with the requirements contained herein within 30 days of
becoming aware of a discharge of 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes in a
calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous wastes to the city sewer
system. Such notification shall include:



      (1)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR
Part 261;



      (2)   The EPA Hazardous waste number;



      (3)   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other);



      (4)   If an industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms
of such waste per calendar per month to the sewer system, the notification
shall also contain the following information to the extent it is known or
readily available to the industrial user:



         (a)   An identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes;



         (b)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of
such constituents in the wastestreams discharged during that calendar month;
and



         (c)   An estimation of the mass of con- stituents in the
wastestreams expected to be dis- charged during the following 12 months.



   (B)   These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants
already reported under the self- monitoring requirements. Whenever the EPA
publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes or new
characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of the
discharge of such a substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations. In the case of any notification made under this division, an
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.076  NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS; ACCIDENTAL SPILLS AND SLUG
DISCHARGES.



   Any user shall notify the city immediately of all discharges that could
cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined in §
51.002. The notification shall include the concentration and volume and
corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact should also
be noted during the notification. Any user who discharges a “slug” (or
slugs) of pollutants shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the
POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city under state
or federal law.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.077  NON-COMPLIANCE REPORTING.



   (A)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.



   (B)   The user shall also repeat the sampling within five days and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation, except the user is not required to re-sample
if:



      (1)   The city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of
at least once per month; or



      (2)   The city performs sampling at the user between the time
when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.078  NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE.



   All users shall promptly notify the city in advance of any substantial
change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including
significant manufacturing process changes, pre-treatment modifications, and
the listed or charac- teristic hazardous wastes for which the user has
submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.079  TOXIC ORGANIC COMPOUND REPORTING.



   (A)   Categorical users which are required by EPA to eliminate
and/or reduce the levels of total toxic organics (TTO's) discharged into the
sewer system must follow the categorical pretreatment Standards for that
industry. Those users must also meet the following requirements:



      (1)   Must sample, as part of the application requirements,
for all the organics listed under the TTO limit (no exceptions);



      (2)   No TTO's used at the facility or the user elects to
develop a solvent management plan in lieu of continuously monitoring for TTO.



   (B)   The user must routinely submit a certifica- tion statement as
part of its self-monitoring report that there has been no dumping of
concentrated toxic organic into the wastewater and that it is imple- menting
a solvent management plan as approved by the city. Facilities who have
sampled initially and can verify that there are no toxic organics utilized
should not have to develop a solvent management plan, but must make the
certification statement of no use of toxic organic compounds during the
reporting period.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.080  REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED USERS.



   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall
provide appropriate reports to the city as may be requested by the city.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.081  RECORD KEEPING.



   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
ordinance and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time
of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period
shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or POTW, or where the user has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the city.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS



§ 51.100  SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS.



   (A)   A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. The city will
determine on a case-by-case whether the user will be able to composite the
individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples
must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques
where feasible. The city may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for
any user that demonstrates that flow-proportional is infeasible. In such
cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent
being discharged.



   (B)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined
by the city and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For
categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of
40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable
categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has
adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with
the adjusted pretreatment standard(s).



   (C)   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than
what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using metho- dologies
in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.101  ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.



   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.102  CITY-MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER.



   The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in §§ 51.100 and
51.101.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



COMPLIANCE MONITORING



§ 51.110  INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.



   (A)   The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user
is complying with all requirements thereof.



   (B)   Users shall allow the city representative ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.



      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the city representative will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purpose of performing specific
responsibilities.



      (2)   The city shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.



      (3)   Any temporary or permanent obstruc- tion to safe and
easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user.



      (4)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.111  MONITORING FACILITIES.



   (A)   Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a
monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of
each sewer discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated
on the user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the
facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles. The city, whenever applicable, may required the construction
and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (for example, at
the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system).



   (B)   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. All
monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with
all applicable local construction standards and specifications.



   (C)   The city may require the user to install monitoring equipment
as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be main-
tained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at
its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.112  SEARCH WARRANTS.



   If the city has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a
need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed
to verify compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, then the city shall seek issuance of a search
and/or seizure warrant from the Municipal Court Judge. Such warrant shall be
served at reasonable hours by the city in the company of a uniformed police
officer of the city.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.113  VANDALISM.



   No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy,
uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure,
appurtenance or equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in
violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in
this chapter.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)  Penalty, see § 51.999



ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES



§ 51.130  NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.



   When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate)
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may
serve upon that user a written notice of violation (via certified letter).
Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation
and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.131  CONSENT ORDERS.



   The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific
action to be taken by the user to correct the non-compliance within a time
period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§ 51.133 and
51.134 and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not
be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.132  SHOW CAUSE HEARING.



   The city may order (via a certified letter) a user which has violated
or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, to appear before the city and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 30 days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.133  COMPLIANCE ORDERS.



   When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user
does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders may also contain other requirements to address the non-compliance,
including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any, other action against the user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.134  CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.



   (A)   When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:



      (1)   Immediately comply with all require- ments; and



      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.



   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.135  ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.



   (A)   When the city finds that a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city
may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,000. Such fines shall be
assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.



   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar
days, be assessed additional penalty as per § 52.18. A lien against the
user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.



   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the city shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of
receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall
be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.



   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.136  EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.



   (A)   The city may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after
informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and
opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.



      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of
the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its
receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall allow
the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless
the termination proceedings in § 51.137 are initiated against the user.



      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under §§ 51.132 and 51.137.



   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspen- sion under this section.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.137  TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE; NON-EMERGENCY.



   (A)   In addition to the provisions in § 51.052, any user that
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:



      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;



      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;



      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;



      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for
the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or



      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 51.010
through 51.021.



   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 51.132 why the
proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city
shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.

§ 51.151  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall
be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under
applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing
a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the
NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will
not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.

§ 51.152  PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPLIANCE.



   (A)   The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily
newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of
the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.



   (B)   The term significant non-compliance shall mean:



      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits,
defined here as those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for
the same pollutant parameter by any amount;



      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here
as those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);



      (3)   Any other discharge violation that the city believes has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through (including endangering the health of city personnel or the general
public);



      (4)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;



      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;



      (6)   Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date,
any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic
self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;



      (7)   Failure to accurately report non- compliance; or



      (8)   Any other violation(s) which the city determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.153  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.



   When the city finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate)
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may
petition the District Court of the county through the City's Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of
the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.154  REMEDIES NON-EXCLUSIVE.



   The provisions in §§ 51.130 through 51.137, 51.150, 51.152, 51.155,
51.156, and 51.999 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a non-compliant
user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance
with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the
right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any non-compliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.155  SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.



   (A)   Performance bonds.  The city may declare to issue or reissue
a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any
provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not
to exceed a value determined by the city to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.



   (B)   Liability insurance.  The city may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply
with any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.



   (C)   Water supply severance.  Whenever a user has violated or
continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only
recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated
its ability to comply.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.156  AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.



   (A)   Upset.



      (1)   For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
non-compliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.



      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards if
the requirements of division (A)(3) are met.



      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:



         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset;



         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and main- tenance procedures; and



         (c)   The user has submitted the following information
to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must
be provided within five days):



            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and
cause of non-compliance;



            2.   The period on non- compliance, including
exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
non-compliance is expected to continue; and



            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.



      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards.



      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.



   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards.  A user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
non-compliance with the prohibitions in § 51.010(A) and (B)(3) through
(B)(7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists
for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit
directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or (b) no
local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature
or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly
in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in
compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.



   (C)   Bypass.



      (1)   For the purposes of this section:



         (a)   “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of
wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.



         (b)   “Severe property damage” means substantial
physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a
bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused delays in
production.



      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of divisions (C)(3) and
(C)(4) of this section.



      (3)   Advanced notice.



         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.



         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of
the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass
and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on
a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.



      (4)   Bypass approval.



         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:



            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage;



            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



            3.   The user submitted notices as required under
division (C)(3) of this section.



         (b)   The POTW may approve an antici- pated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) of this section.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.157  PRETREATMENT CHARGES AND FEES.



   The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of
setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program which may include:



   (A)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including
the cost of processing such applications;



   (B)   Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;



   (C)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge
procedures and construction;



   (D)   Fees for filing appeals; and



   (E)   Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the
requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters
covered by this chapter and are separate from all other fees, fines, and
penalties chargeable by the city.



(Ord. 1796, passed 2-26-96)



§ 51.158  INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER SURCHARGE.



   (A)   Surcharges for biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended
solids surcharge.



      (1)   The industrial wastewater surcharge is an assessment to
industrial users for exceptional treatment costs incurred by the city in the
treatment of high strength wastes above those concentrations on which the
sewer use fees are based. Sewer use fees are based on the design criteria for
the city wastewater treatment plant which is designed for domestic strength,
wastewater concentrations. Assessment of surcharges does not alleviate the
industrial user of the responsibility to comply with treatment requirements.
Consistent non-compliance by an industrial user will result in enforcement
actions as defined by this chapter. Surcharges shall be calculated as follows:



S   = unit cost of treating suspended solids $/lb



S1   = TSS level in monthly sample (in mg/L)



B   = unit cost of treating BOD $/lb



B1   = BOD level in monthly sample (in mg/L)



Bd   = BOD level in plant design criteria for domestic wastewater



   = 250 mg/L (Base value from which the surcharge is calculated)



Sd   = TSS level in plant design criteria for domestic wastewater



   = 250 mg/L (Base value from which the surcharge is calculated)



F   = Discharged flow measured in millions of gallons per day (MGD)



      (2)   The costs of treating TSS and BOD shall be adjusted
annually to reflect increases or decreases in wastewater treatment costs
based on the previous year's experience.



      (3)   The Pretreatment Coordinator shall bill the industrial
user by the month and shall invoice industrial waste charges separate from
the regular bill for water and sewer service fees. The user shall pay monthly
in accordance with practices existing for payment of sewer service fees.



   (B)   Surcharges for all other pollutants.  Industrial users shall
be assessed a surcharge of $25 per contaminant per day for all other
violations of this article. Monthly surcharges are not penalty payments for
violation of the industrial users discharge permit but a reimbursement for
exceptional treatment costs. Assessment of surcharges does not alleviate the
industrial user of the responsibility to comply with pretreatment
requirements. Consistent non-compliance by an industrial user will result in
enforcement actions as defined by this chapter.

      (2)   FSEs or FPEs that conduct operations for less than 120
days in a calendar year may submit a written request to the city to be
permitted to evacuate interceptors as required by division (B)(1) of this
section  at a frequency less often than every 90 days. The FSE or FPE
submitting the request shall comply with division (B)(1) unless the city
provides written approval of a different frequency for the evacuation of the
interceptors that are the subject of the request. Any revised frequency
approved by the city for the evacuation of an interceptor shall not affect
the requirement that an FSE or FPE shall evacuate an interceptor within two
working days whenever 25% or more of an interceptor contains materials as
required by division (B)(1) of this chapter.



   (C)   Interceptor pumping and evacuation.



      (1)   For each interceptor that has a capacity greater than
100 gallons, FSEs and FPEs shall use a liquid waste hauler that is permitted
by the TCEQ to collect, transport and dispose of liquid waste to evacuate an
interceptor. FSEs and FPEs shall cause the wastes in an interceptor to be
completely evacuated by a waste hauler at the time of each interceptor
evacuation that is required by this chapter. Interceptor waste shall be
disposed of only at a facility that is authorized and permitted by applicable
law to receive such waste for disposal.



      (2)   For each interceptor that has a capacity less than or
equal to 100 gallons, FSEs and FPEs may use a liquid waste hauler that is
permitted by the TCEQ to collect, transport and dispose of liquid waste
pursuant to evacuate an interceptor. FSEs and FPEs shall cause the wastes in
an interceptor to be completely evacuated at the time of each interceptor
evacuation that is required by this chapter. Interceptor waste shall be
disposed of only at a facility that is authorized and permitted by applicable
law to receive such waste for disposal.



   (D)   Interceptor inspection. Not less frequently than once per
calendar year, each FSE and FPE shall cause a licensed plumber or other
qualified professional approved by the city to inspect each interceptor.
After evacuation of the interceptor, the licensed plumber or other qualified
professional approved by the city shall make a visual observation of and
shall photograph all inlet and outlet fittings, internal baffles, walls,
floor and all other internal structures. Each FSE and FPE shall cause the
licensed plumber or other qualified professional approved by The city
conducting the inspection to provide a written report of the inspection to
the FSE or FPE that includes the photographs that are required by this
section and that provides the name, address and telephone number of the
licensed plumber or other qualified professional approved by the city
conducting the inspection, the date of the inspection, and a description of
any defects observed during the inspection. All defects shall be corrected by

(Ord. 2016-2107, passed 3-21-16)



§ 51.173  RECORD KEEPING.



   (A)   For each interceptor that has a capacity greater than 100
gallons, each FSE and FPE shall maintain all records that document each
inspection,  repair, cleaning, evacuation, service, or pumping of each
interceptor as required in § 51.172(B) of this chapter.



   (B)   For each interceptor that has a capacity less than or equal to
100 gallons, each FSE and FPE shall maintain all records that document each
inspection, repair, cleaning, evacuation, service, or pumping of each
interceptor as required in § 51.172(B) of this chapter, if a liquid waste
hauler that is permitted by the TCEQ to collect, transport and dispose of
liquid waste is used to evacuate an interceptor. If a permitted liquid waste
hauler is not used to evacuate an interceptor, then each FSE and FPE shall
maintain a cleaning log that lists the location and type of each interceptor,
the date and time of each interceptor evacuation, the quantity of material
removed from the interceptor, the location where the material removed from
the interceptor was disposed of, and the signature of the employee performing
the evacuation of the interceptor.



   (C)   All records required by this chapter shall be maintained by
each FSE and FPE for a period of five years after the date of the event that
is the subject of the record. All such records shall be available for
inspection on the premises of the FSE or FPE where the interceptor that is
the subject of the record is located, unless a written request to store the
records at a different location is submitted to the city and the city
approves the request.



(Ord. 2016-2107, passed 3-21-16)



§ 51.174  PROHIBITIONS.



   (A)   Prohibited discharge to an interceptor. Discharge into an
interceptor of sanitary waste, solvents, emulsifiers, enzymes, chemicals,
products, or bacteria that digest, liquefy, dissolve, or emulsify fats, 
oils,  or grease is prohibited.



   (B)   Removed interceptor waste. Grease, solids, liquids, or any
other matter removed from an interceptor shall not be returned to any
interceptor, or disposed of in any private sanitary sewer line, any portion
of the POTW, or any location other than a facility that is authorized by law
to receive such wastes.



   (C)   No bypass. No liquid or solid waste that contains fats, oils,
or grease may be discharged directly into the POTW. All liquids and solids
that contain fats, oils, or grease that may be discharged by a FSE or a FPE
into the POTW must be discharged into an interceptor before any such
discharges enter the POTW. Should an interceptor require repair, upon written
request to and the receipt of written approval from the city a bypass of the
interceptor shall be permitted for the duration of the repair, but in no
event for more than 18 consecutive hours. Each FSE or FPE shall create a
written record that describes the repairs made to the interceptor, the date
and time of the commencement of any interceptor repairs and of any bypass
during the repairs, and the date and time of the termination of the repairs
and of the bypass.

§ 51.175  RIGHT OF ENTRY.



   Access to premises. Employees of the city, or its authorized agents
shall have the authority to enter the property of a FSE or FPE to conduct
inspections of all or any part of the premises, to inspect and copy documents
that a FSE or FPE is required by this chapter to generate or maintain, to
make photographic documentation and to perform any other action, or to obtain
any other information related to compliance with this subchapter. Each FSE
and FPE shall allow access to its property and facilities for any of such
purposes.



(Ord. 2016-2107, passed 3-21-16)



§ 51.176  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   The failure to perform any action that is required by this
subchapter or the performance of any action that is prohibited by this
subchapter shall constitute a violation of this subchapter.



   (B)   System-wide enforcement. The FSEs and FPEs discharging in the
area defined in § 51.170 of this subchapter are subject to the enforcement
provisions of this subchapter. The city is authorized to take the following
enforcement actions to achieve compliance with this subchapter and its
purposes.



      (1)   Mandatory interceptor service. The city may issue a
notice of violation requiring the FSE or FPE to conduct mandatory maintenance
or repair of an interceptor within a prescribed period. The cost of the
services is the direct responsibility of the FSE or FPE.



      (2)   Mandatory interceptor service schedule. The city may
issue a notice of violation imposing a mandatory pumping and cleaning
schedule to assure the proper maintenance of an interceptor. The cost of the
services is the direct responsibility of the FSE or FPE. A mandatory
interceptor service schedule may cover a time period of up to two years.



      (3)   Cost recovery. The city may issue a notice of violation
assessing the FSE or FPE the amount of expenditures made by the city to
clean-up or prevent sewer blockages and overflows caused by the discharge

§ 52.22  RULES FOR TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICE.

designee is authorized to terminate the utility services being furnished to
any consumer by the city against that consumer's consent and under the
provisions of § 52.19 of this chapter, or whenever utility services
furnished by the city to any consumer is otherwise terminated in a
non-emergency situation other than by such consumer's request, the City
Manager or his designee shall first give or cause to be given to such
consumer a notice in the form and manner described in Division (B) of this
section and afford the consumer an opportunity for a hearing in the form and
manner described in Division (C) of this section before the termination of
such services. If after the City Manager or his designee has complied with
such notice requirements the consumer does not request a hearing for review
of the termination within the time specified in such notice, the City Manager
or his designee may terminate the utilities being furnished by the city to
such consumer on the day and at the time specified in the notice or within
five calendar days thereafter. Any time elapsing after the declared
termination date, the elapsing of which is due to the pendency of a hearing
or an extension of time granted pursuant to a hearing shall not be considered
when calculating the five days in which the City Manager or his designee may
terminate the furnishing of such utilities by the city after a declared
termination date. If a hearing is requested within the time specified in such
notice, the utility services provided by the city to the consumer may not be
terminated pending such hearing. After the deadline for requesting a hearing
has passed, the consumer to whom such notice was given may still request a
hearing to review the decision to terminate such consumer's utility services
if, within ten days of such deadline, such consumer files with the City
Manager an affidavit demonstrating that, through no fault of such consumer,
such notice was not received in time to act upon it prior to such deadline
but the suspension of such termination pending such hearing shall be at the
discretion of the City Manager.



   (B)   Notice.  If sent by mail, the notice must be sent to a
consumer of utility services provided by the city at least eight days prior
to the proposed termination of such services; or, within five days prior to
termination if served by affixing a tag to any improvements located on the
premises to which such services have been provided. If sent by mail, such
notice may be included in the monthly utility bill sent to the consumer at
whose request utilities have been furnished to such premises by the city, or
sent separately by depositing such notice in a U.S. Post Office located in
the city, postage prepaid, and addressed to such consumer at the last address
given to the city by such consumer. If served by attaching a tag to any
improvements located on the premises to which such utility services have been
provided, such tag must be constructed of a heavy and water-resistant grade
of paper and the City Manager or his designee must wire the tag to the font
door handle or, if there is none, then such tag must be wired to another
portion of such improvements where it is most likely to be seen by a person
of ordinary eyesight upon entering such improvements. It shall be a Class C
misdemeanor for any person, other than the person to whom such notice is
addressed, to remove any tag attached to the improvements located on any
premises in the city pursuant to this division of this chapter. If the
consumer to whom such notice is given is a landlord who supplies city utility
services to tenants, the City Manager or his designee must also attempt to
deliver a copy of such notice to such tenants. The notice must be in writing
and clearly communicate the following:



      (1)   The name of the consumer receiving services;



      (2)   The street address where utility services are proposed
to be terminated;



      (3)   The reason for the proposed utility service termination,

continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, and
that the violation(s) has caused or contributed to an actual or threatened
discharge to the MS4 or waters of the U.S. which reasonably appears to
present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment, the City Manager may issue an emergency cease
and desist order to the violator directing the violator to immediately cease

immediately halting operations, terminating the discharge or both.



   (B)   Any person to which an emergency cease and desist order has
been directed, shall, upon receipt of such order, immediately take action to
stop or eliminate the endangering discharge.  In the event of that
person’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the order, the City
Manager may take such action(s) as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize
harm to the MS4 or waters of the U.S. or endangerment to persons or to the
environment.  Such actions may include, but are not limited to, immediate
termination of water supply, sewer connection or other municipal utility
service provided to said person; to any facility owned, leased or operated
all or in part by said person; or to any site for which said person is all or
in part an owner or lessee.

cease and desist order has been issued to recommence discharges when the City
Manager determines that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further
termination proceedings are initiated against the person to whom the order
was issued.



   (D)   A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a written statement,
in a form as may be acceptable to the City Manager, describing the causes of
the harmful discharge and measures taken or to be taken within a timely
fashion to prevent any future occurrence, to the City Manager within 14
calendar days of receipt of the emergency order.



   (E)   Issuance of an emergency cease and desist order shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
violator.

improvement made, to secure the expenses thereof. Such lien shall be second
only to tax liens and liens for street improvements, and the amount thereof

was filed. For any such expenditures and interest, suit may be instituted and
recovery and foreclosure of the lien may be had in the name of the city in a

agents, have the right, permission and license to trim trees upon and
overhanging the rights-of-way to prevent trees from coming in contact with

city may require the registered user, at its expense: to remove the facility
from the rights-of-way or to modify the facility in order to protect the
public health and safety. Unless notification is received or unless otherwise
provided in this chapter, a registered user shall remove all abandoned
above-ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the
city and shall restore any affected right-of-way to its former state at the
time such facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair the
usefulness of such right-of-way. In removing any plant, structures or
equipment comprising a facility, a registered user shall refill, at its own
expense, any excavation necessarily made by it and shall leave all
rights-of-way in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal
without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or
other utility wires, poles or attachments. The city shall have the right to
inspect and approve the condition of the rights-of-way, cables, wires,
attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity
and insurance provisions of this chapter shall continue in full force and
effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by a registered
user with the terms and conditions of this chapter. Upon abandonment of any
facilities in place, a registered user, if required by the city, shall submit
to the city a written instrument, satisfactory in form to the city,
transferring to the city the ownership of the abandoned facilities in place

registered user.

occupied by a registered user, and to change any curb or sidewalk or the
grade of any street or alley and to maintain all of the facilities owned by

hearing, suspend any permit, license or certificate to operate a food service
establishment if the holder of the permit, license or certificate does not
comply with the applicable requirements of §§ 111.01 through 111.08, or if
the operation of the establishment does not comply with the applicable
requirements of §§ 111.01 through 111.08, or if the operation of the food
service establishment otherwise constitutes a substantial hazard to public
health. Suspension is effective upon service of the notice required by

license or certificate shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the
Health Officer within 20 days of receipt of a request for a hearing.

service of the notice, immediately suspended and that an opportunity for a
hearing will be provided if a written request for a hearing is filled with
the Health Officer by the holder of the permit, license or certificate within
ten days.  If no written request for a hearing is filed within ten days, the
suspension is automatically sustained.  A suspension shall end when in the

Officer shall notify the holder of the permit, license or certificate, or the
person in charge, in writing, of the proposed revocation, the reasons
therefor and that the permit, license or certificate shall be revoked at the
end of the ten days following service of such notice unless a written request
for a hearing is filed with the Health Officer by the holder of the permit,
license or certificate within such ten day period.  If no request for a
hearing is filed within the ten day period, the revocation of the permit,
license or certificate automatically becomes final.

the holder of the permit, license or certificate, or the person in charge of
the establishment.  Based upon the recorded evidence introduced at such
hearing, the Health Officer shall make a final finding and order. In the case
of an appeal of a suspension by the Health Officer, such order may sustain,
modify or rescind such suspension. In the case of a proposed revocation, such
order shall grant or refuse to grant such revocation. A written report of the
hearing decision shall be furnished to the holder of the permit, license or
certificate by the Health Officer.



   (G)   Application after revocation.  Whenever a revocation of a
permit, license or certificate has become final, the holder of the revoked
permit, license or certificate may make written application for a new permit,
license or certificate.



   (H)   Refusal of issuance.  If the application for a permit,
license or certificate and the accompanying contract documents describing the
work or operation do not conform to the applicable requirements of §§
111.01 through 111.08 or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the Health
Officer shall not issue a permit, license or certificate, but shall return
the application and documents to the applicant with a notation thereon of
such refusal to issue the permit, license or certificate.  Such refusal
shall, when requested, be in a separate writing which shall contain the

exists.  Opportunity for inspection shall be offered within a reasonable
time.



   (E)   Inspection report form.  An inspection report form based on
the requirements of § 111.05 (C) shall be on file with the Health Officer

city’s streets for the purpose of constructing or operating a cable system
or providing cable service to any part of the franchise area on terms or

after the award of an initial franchise, the grantee shall deposit with the
city either an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution or a
security deposit in the amount of $50,000. The form and content of such
letter of credit or security deposit shall be approved by the City Attorney,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. These instruments shall be
used to insure the faithful performance of the Grantee of all provisions of
its franchise; and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any
agency, commission, board, department, division, or office of the city having
jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the franchise, and the payment
by the grantee of any claims, liens, and taxes due the city which arise by
reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system.



   (B)   The letter of credit or security deposit shall be maintained
at the amount established by the city for the entire term of the franchise,
and shall be replenished within 30 days if amounts have to be withdrawn.



   (C)   If the grantee fails to pay to the city any compensation
within the time fixed herein; or fails after 15 days written notice to pay to
the city any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the city within 15 days
any damages, costs or expenses which the city is compelled to pay by reason
of any act or default of the grantee in connection with the franchise, or
fails, after 30 days written notice of such failure by the city to comply
with any provision of the franchise which the city reasonably determines can
be remedied by demand on the letter of credit or security deposit, the city
may immediately request payment of the amount thereof, with interest and any
penalties, from the letter of credit or security deposit. The grantee has the
right to appeal such demand by the city to the City Council, who shall hear
the matter in a public meeting and allow the grantee to be heard and present
evidence of compliance.



   (D)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the letter of
credit are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by
this chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right the
city may have.



   (E)   The letter of credit or security deposit shall be
non-cancelable, except upon 30 days prior written notice to the city.



   (F)   If an existing letter of credit or security deposit is to be
canceled, grantee shall provide evidence of a replacement letter of credit or
security deposit to the city 15 days prior to the cancellation date. Failure
to provide evidence of replacement surety shall be construed as a default
granting the city the right to call on the bank for the initial security
deposit or letter of credit.



   (G)   The city at any time during the term of this chapter may waive
grantee’s requirement to maintain a letter of credit or security deposit.
The invitation to waive the requirement can be initiated by the city or
grantee.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.14  PERFORMANCE BOND.



   (A)   Unless otherwise set forth in the franchise, within 30 days
after the award of an initial franchise, the grantee shall file with the city
a performance bond in the amount of not less than 50% of costs to install the
system contained in the new application in favor of the city. This bond shall
be maintained throughout the construction period and until such time as
determined by the city.



   (B)   If the grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or
resolution governing the franchise, or fails to well and truly observe,
fulfill and perform each term and condition of the franchise as it relates to
the conditions relative to the construction of the cable system, there shall
be recoverable jointly and severally, from the principal and surety of the
bond, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the
full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or
abandonment of any property of the grantee, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorney’s fees, including the city’s legal staff and costs, up to the
full amount of the bond. This section shall be an additional remedy to those
outlined in § 114.13.



   (C)   The city may, upon completion of construction of the cable
system, waive or reduce the requirement of the grantee to maintain the bond.
However, the city may require a performance bond to be posted by the grantee
for any construction subsequent to the completion of the initial cable
system, in a reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the city.



   (D)   The bond shall be non-cancelable, except upon 30 days prior
written notice to the city. If an existing bond is to be canceled, grantee
shall provide evidence of a replacement bond to the city 15 days prior to the
cancellation date. Failure to provide evidence of a replacement bond shall be
construed as default granting the city the right to call in the bond.



   (E)   The city at any time during the term of the franchise may
waive a grantee’s requirement to maintain a performance bond. The
invitation to waive the requirement can be initiated by the city or grantee.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.15  LIABILITY AND INSURANCE.



   (A)   A grantee shall maintain and by its acceptance of a franchise
specifically agrees that it will maintain throughout the term of the

compliance with this section shall be filed and maintained with the city
during the term of the franchise.



   (C)   Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages
recovered by the city thereunder shall be construed to or limit the liability
of the grantee under any franchise issued hereunder or for damages.



   (D)   Such coverage shall be non-cancelable, except upon 30 days
prior written notice to the city.

liable for injury or damage occurring to any person or property from any
cause whatsoever arising out of the construction, maintenance, repair, use,
operation, condition or dismantling of a grantee’s cable system, except in
circumstances where the injury or damage was caused by the negligence and/or
willful misconduct of the city, or the negligence and/or willful misconduct
of the city in conjunction with another person.



   (B)   Indemnification.  The grantee shall, at its sole cost and
expense, indemnify and hold harmless the city, all associated, affiliated,
allied and subsidiary entities of the city, now existing or hereinafter
created, and their respective officers, boards, commissions, employees,
agents, attorneys, and contractors (hereinafter referred to as
“indemnities”), from and against:  Any and all liability, obligation,
damages, penalties, claims, liens, costs, charges, losses and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
expert witnesses and consultants), which may be imposed upon, incurred by or
be asserted against the indemnities by reason of any act or omission of the
grantee, its personnel, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors,
resulting in personal injury, bodily injury, sickness, disease or death to
any person or damage to, loss of or destruction of tangible or intangible
property, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and unauthorized use of any
trademark, tradename, copyright, patent, service mark or any other right of
any person, which may arise out of grantee’s construction, installation,
operation, maintenance or condition of its cable system, its subcontractors
or agents, or the grantee’s failure to comply with any federal, state or
local statute, ordinance or regulation.



   (C)   Assumption of risk.  The grantee undertakes and assumes for
its officers, agents, contractors and subcontractors and employees, all risk
of dangerous conditions, if any, on or about any city owned or controlled
property, including streets.



   (D)   Defense of indemnities.  In the event any action or
proceeding shall be brought against the indemnities by reason of any matter
for which the indemnities are indemnified hereunder, the grantee shall not
admit liability in any such matter on behalf of the indemnities without the
written consent of the city. The city must afford grantee the opportunity to
participate in and fully control any compromise, settlement, resolution or
disposition of any claim or proceeding for which the grantee is providing
indemnification. The city will also fully cooperate in the defense of any
such claim and make available to grantee all such information under its
control relating thereto.



   (E)   Notice of cooperation and expenses.  The city shall give the
grantee prompt notice of the making of any claim or the commencement of any
action, suit or other proceeding covered by the provisions of this section.
No recovery by the city of any sum under the letter of credit or security
fund shall be a limitation upon the liability of the grantee to the city
under the terms of this section, except that any sum so received by the city
from the letter of credit or security fund shall be deducted from any
recovery which the city might have against the grantee under the terms of
this section.



   (F)   Nonwaiver of statutory limits.  Nothing in this chapter is
intended to express or imply a waiver of the statutory provisions, of any
kind or nature, as set forth in Texas Statues, including the limits of
liability of the city as exists presently or may be increased from time to
time by the legislature.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)

franchise area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case the
said schedule will be made part of the franchise, and will be binding upon
the grantee.



      (3)   Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless
specifically approved by the city, will be considered a violation of the
franchise for which the provisions of § 114.35 shall apply, as determined by
the city.



      (4)   In special circumstances the city can waive 100%
completion within the two year time frame provided substantial completion is
accomplished within allotted time frame, substantial completion construed to
be not less than 95% and justification for less than 100% must be submitted
subject to the satisfaction of the city.



   (B)   Line extensions.



      (1)   A grantee shall only be required to construct and extend
its cable system pursuant to the following requirements:



         (a)   No subscriber shall be refused service
arbitrarily. To expedite the process of extending the cable system into a new
subdivision, the city will forward to the grantee an approved engineering
plan of each project. Subject to the density requirements set forth below,
the grantee shall commence the design and construction process upon receipt
of the final engineering plan. Upon notification from the city that the first
home in the project has been approved for building permit, the grantee shall
have a maximum of three months to complete the construction/activation
process within the project phase.



         (b)   The grantee must extend and make Cable Service
available to all areas having at least 30 dwelling units per street mile, as
measured from the existing cable system.



         (c)   The grantee must extend and make cable television
service available to any residence in the franchise area requesting
connection at the standard connection charge, if the connection to the
isolated resident would require no more than a standard 125 foot drop line.
For connections greater than 125 feet, grantee may charge the potential
subscriber the appropriate published non-standard installation fee.



      (2)   Early extension.  In areas not meeting the requirements
for mandatory extension of service, the grantee shall provide, upon the
request of a potential subscriber desiring cable service, an estimate of the
costs required to extend cable service to the subscriber. The grantee shall
then extend cable service upon request of the potential subscriber. The
grantee may require advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to
the grantee. The amount paid by subscribers for early extensions shall be
nonrefundable, and in the event the area subsequently reaches the density
required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be treated as
consideration for early extension.



   (C)   Nothing herein shall be construed to require a grantee to
extend its cable system into an area annexed into the franchise area which is
currently served by another grantee.



      (1)   The grantee, in its application, may propose a line
extension policy which will result in serving more residents of the city than
as required above, in which case the grantee’s policy will be incorporated
into the franchise, and will be binding on the grantee.



      (2)   The violation of this section shall be considered a
breach of the terms of this chapter for which the provisions of § 114.35
shall apply.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.20  CONSTRUCTION AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS.

grantee shall place its cables, wires, or other like facilities underground.



      (8)   Upon receiving reasonable advance notice from the city,
the grantee shall remove any abandoned portion of the cable system which
poses a safety or health hazard in the opinion of the city.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.21  USE OF STREETS.



   (A)   Interference with persons and improvements.  The grantee’s
cable system shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its
facilities shall endanger or unreasonably interfere with the lives of persons
or unreasonably interfere with the rights or reasonable convenience of
property owners who adjoin any of the streets, or interfere with any
improvements the city may deem proper to make, or unnecessarily hinder or
obstruct the free use of the streets or public property.



   (B)   Restoration to prior condition.  In case of any disturbance
of pavement, sidewalk, landscaping, driveway or other surfacing by the
grantee, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner
approved by the city, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway,
landscaping, or surface of any street disturbed, in as good condition as
immediately before the work was commenced and in accordance with any
generally applicable ordinances of the city. Approval by the city shall not
be unreasonably withheld.



   (C)   Erection, removal and common uses of poles.



      (1)   No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be
erected by the grantee without prior approval of the city with regard to
location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location
of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested
interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the
grantee at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public
convenience would be enhanced thereby.



      (2)   Where poles or other wire-holding structures already
existing for use in serving the city are available for use by the grantee,
but it does not make arrangements for such use, the city may require the
grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public
convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to
the grantee are just and reasonable. For purposes of this section, the city
shall consider the terms of use to be just and reasonable only if they are
comparable to established state and/or federal standards.



      (3)   In the absence of any governing federal or state
statute, where the city or a public utility serving the city desires to make
use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but
agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the city may require
the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as
the city shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the city determines
that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly
interfere with the grantee’s operations. For purposes of this section, just
and reasonable terms of use shall be those comparable to established state
and/or federal standards.



   (D)   Relocation of the facilities.  If at any time during the
period of this franchise the city shall lawfully elect to alter or change the
grade of any street, the grantee, upon reasonable written notice by the city,
shall remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground
conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense unless the utilities
are compensated, in which case the grantee shall be similarly compensated.



   (E)   Cooperation with building movers.  The grantee shall, on the
request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city,
temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The
expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid
by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority
to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than
five business days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire
changes.



   (F)   Tree trimming.  The grantee shall comply with any generally
applicable ordinances of the city related to the trimming of trees and other
shrubbery in or overhanging the streets or public property.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.22  OPERATIONAL STANDARDS.



   (A)   The grantee shall put, keep and maintain all parts of the
cable system in good condition throughout the entire franchise period.



   (B)   Upon the reasonable request for cable service by any person
located within the franchise area, the grantee shall, within 30 days, furnish
the requested service to such person subject to the line extension policy set
forth in § 114.19 (B)(1)(b), and payment of any reasonable deposits and
advance fees required by the grantee.



   (C)   The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs
promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time
possible. Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by
notice and shall occur during periods of minimum system use.



   (D)   The grantee shall not allow its cable or other operations to
interfere with television reception of subscribers or persons not served by
the grantee, nor shall the system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any
manner the operation of the various utilities serving the residents within
the confines of the city nor shall other utilities interfere with the
grantee’s system.



   (E)   The grantee shall maintain a local, toll-free, or collect call
telephone access line which will be available to subscribers 24 hours per day
and seven days per week. Trained representatives of the grantee will be
available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal business
hours, as defined herein. After normal business hours, an access line will be
available to be answered by an answering service or automated response
system, including a phone answering system. Inquiries received after normal
business hours must be responded to by a trained representative of the
grantee on the next business day.



   (F)   Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time,
including wait time, shall not exceed 30 seconds from when the connection is
made. If the call needs to be transferred, transfer time will not exceed 30
seconds. These standards shall be met no less than 90% of the time under
normal operating conditions, as measured on a quarterly basis.



   (G)   Under normal operating conditions, the subscriber will receive
a busy signal less than 3% of the time. This standard shall be met no less
than 90% of the time as measured on a quarterly basis.



   (H)   Standard installations will be performed within seven business
days after an order has been placed. A standard installation is one that is
within 125 feet of the existing distribution system.



   (I)   Excluding those situations outside of normal operating
conditions, the grantee will respond to any service interruption promptly and
in no event later than 24 hours from the time the interruption becomes known
to the grantee. All other regular service requests will be responded to
within 36 hours during the normal business hours for the cable system under
normal operating conditions. The appointment window alternatives for
installations, service calls and other installation activities will not
exceed a four-hour “window” during normal business hours for the cable
system, or at a time that is mutually acceptable. The grantee may schedule
supplemental hours during which appointments can be scheduled based on the
needs of the community. If at any time an installer or technician is running
late, an attempt to contact the subscriber will be made and the appointment
rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the subscriber.



   (J)   Customer service centers and bill payment locations will be
open for walk-in customer transactions a minimum of 8 hours a day Monday
through Friday unless there is a need to modify those hours because of the
location or customers served. The grantee and city by mutual consent will
establish supplemental hours on weekdays and weekends if it would fit the
needs of the community. At least one walk-in customer service center shall be
located in either Lake Jackson, Clute, Freeport, Richwood, or within ten
miles of the municipal boundary of any of these cities.



   (K)   For service interruptions and/or outages of over four hours,
the grantee shall provide, at the subscriber’s request, a prorated credit
of the affected cable service.



   (L)   The Grantee will provide written information in each of the
following areas at the time of installation and at any future time upon the
request of the subscriber:



      (1)   Product and services offered;



      (2)   Prices and service options;



      (3)   Installation and service policies; and



      (4)   How to use the cable services.



   (M)   Bills will be clear, concise and understandable, with all
cable services itemized.



   (N)   Credits will be issued promptly, but no later than the
subscriber’s next billing cycle following the resolution of the request and
the return of the equipment supplied by the grantee if cable service has been
terminated.



   (O)   Subscribers will be notified a minimum of 30 days in advance
of any rate or programming channel change, provided that the change is within
the control of the grantee.



   (P)   The grantee shall maintain and operate its cable system in
accordance with the rules and regulations as are incorporated herein or may
be lawfully promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, the United
States Congress, or the State of Texas.



   (Q)   The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which will
indicate the nature of each subscriber contact made in the last 12 months
which results in a service call, the date and time it was received, the
disposition of said service call, and the time and date thereof. This log
shall be made available for periodic inspection by the city, pursuant to §
114.28 and subscriber privacy rights under § 631 of the Cable Act.



   (R)   All personnel of the grantee contacting subscribers or
potential subscribers outside the office of grantee must be clearly
identified as associated with the grantee.



   (S)   The grantee shall not terminate cable service for nonpayment
of a delinquent account unless the grantee provides initial notice of the
delinquency and impending termination at least ten days prior to the proposed
termination. The notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid to the subscriber to
whom the service is billed. This notice shall not be sent until the 28th day
after the initial bill for service was mailed to the subscriber. The notice
of delinquency and impending termination may be part of a billing statement.
This section does not apply to subscribers disconnected due to NSF checks.



   (T)   Refund checks shall be issued within 30 days following the
subscriber’s request or 30 days following the return of the grantee’s
equipment by the subscriber, whichever is later.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.23  CONTINUITY OF CABLE SERVICE MANDATORY.



   (A)   It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving
cable service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee
are honored. This does not require the grantee to provide service to
subscribers who are abusive to the employee of the grantee. If the grantee
elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify or sell the cable system, or the city
gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this franchise, the
grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted cable service regardless of the circumstances. For purposes of
this section, “continuous and uninterrupted” does not include service
interruptions and outages of cable service experienced by subscribers during
the regular course of business.



   (B)   If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator
acquires the cable system, the grantee shall cooperate with the city, new
franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of cable service to all
subscribers. During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the
revenues for any period during which it operates the cable system, and shall
be entitled to reasonable costs for its services until it no longer operates
the cable system.



   (C)   If the grantee fails to operate the cable system for 30
consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just cause,
the city may, at its option, operate the cable system or designate an
operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions
acceptable to the city or a permanent operator is selected. If the city is
required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the grantee shall
reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues
from the cable system received by the city that are the result of the
grantee’s failure to perform.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.24  COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.



   (A)   The Mayor is designated as having primary responsibility for
the continuing administration of the franchises and implementation of
procedures for handling subscriber complaints against the grantee received by
the city.



   (B)   During the term of any franchise, and any renewal thereof, the
grantee shall maintain a central office for the purpose of receiving and
resolving all complaints regarding the quality of service, equipment
malfunctions, and similar matters. The office must be reachable by a local,
toll-free telephone call. The grantee will use its good faith efforts to
arrange for one or more payment locations in a central location where
subscribers can pay bills or conduct other business activities.



   (C)   At the time of installation, the grantee shall furnish
information to subscribers concerning the procedures for making inquiries or
complaints, including the name, address and local telephone number of the
employee or employees or agent of the grantee to whom such inquiries or
complaints are to be addressed.



   (D)   When there have been similar complaints made, or where there
exists other substantial evidence, which, in the judgment of the city, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the city shall have the
right and authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the
performance of the cable system. The grantee shall fully cooperate with the
city in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if
requested, within 30 days after notice. Such report shall include the
following information:



      (1)   The nature of the complaint or problem which
precipitated the special tests;



      (2)   What cable system component(s) were tested;



      (3)   The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;



      (4)   The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem
was resolved;



      (5)   Any other information pertinent to the tests and
analysis which may be required.



   The city may require that tests be supervised by an independent person
of the city’s choice. This person should sign all records of special tests
and forward to the city such records with a report interpreting the results
of the tests and recommending actions to be taken. Should such a test prove
that the grantee substantially failed to meet the technical standard, the
grantee shall bear the reasonable cost of the test. If the test should prove
that the grantee met the technical standards, or if the failure is not
substantial, the city shall bear the cost of the test.



   The city’s right under this section shall be limited to requiring
tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as
the city has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other
evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against
substandard cable service.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.25  GRANTEE RULES AND REGULATIONS.



   The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules,
regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as
shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights
and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure uninterrupted
cable service to each and all of its subscribers; provided, however, that
such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with
the lawfully enforceable provisions hereof or applicable state and federal
laws, rules and regulations. For purposes of this section,
“uninterrupted” does not include service interruptions and outages
experienced during the regular course of business.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.26  FRANCHISE FEE.



   (A)   For the reason that the streets of the city to be used by the
grantee in the operation of its cable system within the boundaries of the
city are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at
great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the grantee to use the
streets is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be
required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and
acquisitions, the grantee shall pay to the city an amount equal to 5% of the
grantee’s gross annual revenue received by the grantee from the operations
of its cable system to provide cable services within the franchise area. If
the statutory 5% limitation on franchise fees is raised or the federal
statute deletes the franchise fee limitation entirely, then the franchise fee
may be subject to renegotiation.



   (B)   This payment shall be in addition to any other generally
applicable tax or payment owed to the city by the grantee.



   (C)   The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly to the city
within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter, and shall be
accompanied by a complete and accurate certified statement of all of the
grantee’s gross revenues for the period.



   (D)   The city shall have the right to inspect the grantee’s
income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined
to be payable under this chapter. Any additional amount due to the city as a
result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to
the grantee by the city, which notice shall include a copy of the audit
report.



   (E)   The period of limitation for recovery of any franchise fee
payable hereunder shall be four years from the date on which payment by the
grantee is due.



   (F)   The grantee shall pay interest on any net franchise fee
underpayment for the calendar year at the annual prime rate - or the maximum
rate allowed by law, whichever is less - from 45 days after the end of the
calendar year until the date the payment is received by the city.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.27  TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



   (A)   Except as may otherwise be provided in a franchise, the
franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, other than to a person
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the grantee, without
the prior written consent of the city. No such consent shall be required,
however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by
assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the grantee in the franchise
or cable system in order to secure indebtedness. The proposed assignee must
show financial responsibility as determined by the city and must agree to
comply with all provisions of the franchise. The city shall have 120 days to
act upon any request for approval of such a sale or transfer submitted in
writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with FCC regulations. The city shall be deemed to have consented
to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not
communicated in writing to the grantee within 120 days unless the requesting
party and the city agree to an extension of time. The city shall not
unreasonably withhold such consent to the proposed transfer.



   (B)   Except as may otherwise be provided in a franchise, the
grantee shall promptly notify the city of any actual or proposed change in,
or transfer of, or acquisition by any other person of control of the grantee.
Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make
the Franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have
consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the
purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or
acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualification of the
prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the city in such
inquiry.



   (C)   The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the
grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in
and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms be expressly
subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.



   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will
not approve any transfer or assignment of an initial franchise prior to
substantial completion of construction of the proposed cable system.



   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be
approved without successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.28  AVAILABILITY OF BOOKS AND RECORDS.



   (A)   The grantee shall fully cooperate in making available at
reasonable times, and the city shall have the right to inspect where
reasonably necessary to the enforcement of the franchise, books, records,
maps, plans and other like materials of the grantee applicable to the cable
system, at any time during normal business hours; provided, where volume and
convenience necessitate, the grantee may require inspection to take place on
the grantee premises. The city agrees to treat any information disclosed by
the grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees,
representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to
enforce the provisions of the franchise. The grantee shall not be required to
provide subscriber information in violation of § 631 of the Cable Act.



   (B)   The grantee shall prepare and furnish, upon receipt of a
written request from the city, such reports with respect to its operations,
affairs, transactions or property as is reasonably necessary or appropriate
to the performance of the city’s rights, functions or duties under the
franchise. The city shall consult with the grantee as to the form, detail,
and due dates of the reports requested, and accept copies of reports
generated by the grantee in the normal course of business whenever possible.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.29  OTHER PETITIONS AND APPLICATIONS.



   Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports
either submitted by the grantee to the Federal Communications Commission,
Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory
commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting
cable television operations authorized pursuant to the franchise or received
from such agencies shall be provided to the city upon request.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.30  FISCAL REPORTS.



   The grantee shall file annually with the city no later than 120 days
after the end of the grantee’s fiscal year, a copy of a gross revenues
statement certified by an officer or CPA of the grantee.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.31  REQUIRED SERVICES AND FACILITIES.



   (A)   Unless otherwise provided for in the franchise, each cable
system shall offer a minimum of 77 full-time video programming services to
subscribers. Cable systems shall utilize fiber to the node architecture
consistent with cable television industry standards in order to meet the FCC
technical specifications. In addition, the average fiber node size shall be
no greater than 2,500 homes per node and the average amplifier cascade shall
be no greater than 12, with the longest amplifier cascade no greater than 15.
For cable systems that were initially constructed prior to the effective date
of this chapter, the timeline to incorporate fiber to the node shall be as
noted in the franchise. Considering the rapid changes in cable system
technology, a grantee may present for city approval an alternative
architecture that results in comparable benefits to cable system picture
quality and reliability as fiber to the node. Such approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.



   (B)   Such cable system shall have the technical capacity for
“two-way” communications, provided, however, that the return does not
need to be activated, and the offering of two-way services is not required,
until the grantee believes that such services are technically and
economically feasible, and the grantee has obtained such additional
regulatory consent as may be required by state or federal law to provide
two-way services.



   (C)   At the city’s request, unless otherwise designated in the
franchise, the grantee shall maintain the following:



      (1)   At least one specially designated noncommercial public
access channel available on a first-come, nondiscriminatory basis;



      (2)   At least one specially designated, noncommercial channel
for use by local educational authorities;



      (3)   At least one specially designated, noncommercial channel
for local governmental uses;



      (4)   These uses may be combined on one or more channels until
such time as dedicated channels become necessary. Capital support for the
purchase and/or replacement of equipment for public, educational and
government access shall be separately incorporated into the franchise.



      (5)   Upon written request by the city, and provided that no
regulatory consent is required from any state or federal authority for the
provision of services requested by the city, grantee shall construct and make
available an institutional network (“I-Net”) of cable, optical,
electrical or electronic equipment, used for the purpose of transmitting
two-way signals between designated city buildings. Nothing contained herein
should be construed as a requirement for the grantee to construct an
institutional network without fair reimbursement from the city of the capital
cost to provide such facilities, nor receive air compensation for the
maintenance and use of such network.



   (D)   The grantee shall incorporate into its cable system the
capacity which will permit the city, in times of emergency, to override, by
remote control, the audio of all channels simultaneously which the grantee
may lawfully override. The grantee shall provide emergency broadcast capacity
pursuant to FCC rules. The grantee shall cooperate with the city in the use
and operation of the emergency alert override system. The city shall permit
only appropriately trained and authorized persons to operate the EAS
equipment and shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any use of the
grantee’s cable system in any manner that results in the inappropriate use
thereof, or any loss or damage to the cable system. Except to the extent
expressly prohibited by law, the city shall hold the grantee, its employees,
officers and assigns harmless from any claims arising out of the emergency
use of its facilities by the city, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees and costs.



   (E)   (1)   The city may desire for the grantee to interconnect
its cable system with other adjacent cable television systems for the purpose
of sharing public, educational, and governmental access programming.
Interconnections shall only be implemented upon agreement between grantee and
the contiguous cable operator.



      (2)   Interconnection procedure.  Upon receiving the
directive of the city to interconnect, the grantee shall immediately initiate
good-faith negotiations with the other affected system or systems in order
that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both
construction and operation of the interconnection link.



      (3)   Cooperation required.  The grantee shall reasonably
cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection
authority or city, county, state and federal regulatory agency which may be
hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or otherwise
providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of
the city.



   (F)   Grantee shall include in its cable service a broad range of
programming. Grantee shall take into account the programming preferences of
its subscribers in making its programming decisions.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.32  RULES AND REGULATIONS.



   In addition to the inherent powers of the city to regulate and control
its streets, the right and power is hereby reserved by the city to promulgate
such additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its
lawful powers and furtherance of the terms and conditions of this chapter;
provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall
not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal
laws, rules and regulations.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.33  PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SESSIONS.



   (A)   The city and the grantee may hold scheduled performance
evaluation sessions within 30 days of the third and sixth anniversary dates
of the grantee’s award or renewal of a franchise and as may be required by
federal and state law.



   (B)   Special evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the
term of the franchise at the request of the city or the grantee.



   (C)   All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and
announced in accordance with the city’s required legal notice.



   (D)   Topics which may be discussed at any scheduled or special
evaluation session may include, but not be limited to, service rate
structures; franchise fee, penalties, free or discounted services;
application of new technologies; system performance; services provided;
programming offered; customer complaints; privacy; amendments to this
chapter; judicial and FCC rulings; line extension policies; and grantee or
city rules.



   (E)   Members of the general public may add topics either by working
through the negotiating parties or by presenting a petition. If such a
petition bears the valid signatures of 50 or more residents of the city, the
proposed topic or topics shall be added to the list of topics to be discussed
at the evaluation session.



§ 114.34  RATE CHANGE PROCEDURES.



   The city may regulate rates for the provision of basic cable and
equipment as expressly permitted by federal law.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.35  VIOLATIONS, FORFEITURE AND TERMINATION.



   (A)   In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the
city under this chapter or otherwise, the city reserves the right to forfeit
and terminate the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee
hereunder in the event of a substantial breach of its terms and conditions. A
substantial breach by the grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to
the following:



      (1)   Violation of any material provision of the franchise or
any material rule, order, regulation or determination of the city made
pursuant to the franchise;



      (2)   Attempt to evade any material provision of the franchise
or practice any fraud or deceit upon the city or its subscribers;



      (3)   Failure to begin or complete cable system construction
or cable system extension as provided under § 114.19;



      (4)   Failure to provide the cable services promised in the
grantee’s application if any as incorporated herein by § 114.04;



      (5)   Failure to restore cable service after 96 consecutive
hours of interrupted service to the entire cable system, except when approval
of such interruption is obtained from the city; or



      (6)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application
for or negotiation of the franchise.



   (B)   The foregoing shall not constitute a major breach if the
violation occurs but is without fault of the grantee or occurs as a result of
circumstances beyond its control. The grantee shall not be excused by mere
economic hardship or by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers
or employees.



   (C)   The city may make a written demand that the grantee comply
with any such specific provision, rule, order or determination under or
pursuant to the franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a
period of 30 days following such written demand without written proof that
the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously
pursued, the city may place the issue of the violation of the franchise
before the City Council. The city shall cause to be served upon the grantee,
at least 20 days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of the
time, place and purpose of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the
meeting and the issue(s) which the city is to consider.



   (D)   The City Council shall hear and consider the issue(s), provide
the grantee with an opportunity to be heard, hear any other person interested
therein, and shall determine in its discretion whether or not any violation
by the grantee has occurred.



   (E)   If the City Council shall determine the violation by the
grantee was the fault of the grantee and was within its control to prevent,
the Council may, by resolution:



      (1)   Seek specific performance of any provision, which
reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;



      (2)   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek
other equitable relief, or



      (3)   In the case of a substantial default of a material
provision of the franchise, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall
be forfeited and terminated unless there is compliance within such period as
the Council may fix, such period shall not be less than 60 days, provided no
opportunity for compliance need be granted for fraud or misrepresentation.



   (F)   The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be
placed upon the Council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for
compliance. The Council then may terminate the franchise forthwith upon
finding that the grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further
extend the period, in its discretion.



   (G)   The grantee may appeal such determination to terminate the
franchise to an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction which shall have
the power to review the city’s decision de novo, and to modify or reverse
such decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court
must be taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the city.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.36  FORCE MAJEURE.



   Grantees shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with,
the provisions of the franchise or this chapter, nor suffer any enforcement
or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination,
cancellation or revocation of the franchise), where such noncompliance or
alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike, riot, war, earthquake,
flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or
other catastrophic act of nature, labor disputes, governmental,
administrative or judicial order or regulation or other event that is
reasonably beyond the grantee’s ability to anticipate and control. This
provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to
service or monitor their own utility poles on which the grantee’s cable
and/or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or
qualified labor to perform the work necessary.



   It is not the city’s intention to subject grantees to penalties,
fines, forfeitures or revocation of the franchise for violations of the
franchise or chapter where the violation was a good faith error that resulted
in no or minimal negative impact on the subscribers within the franchise
area, or where strict performance would result in practical difficulties and
hardship to the grantee which outweigh the benefit to be derived by the city
and/or subscribers.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.37  FORECLOSURE.



   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial
part of the cable system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all
or a substantial part of the cable system, the grantee shall notify the city
of such fact, and such notification shall be treated as a notification that a
change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the
franchise governing the consent of the city to such change in control of the
grantee shall apply.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.38  RIGHT OF ACQUISITION BY THE CITY.



   Federal regulations as per Section 627 of the Cable Act shall apply to
the right of acquisition of the grantee’s cable system by the city.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.39  CONTINUANCE OF OPERATION AFTER REVOCATION.



   In the case of a final determination of a lawful revocation of the
franchise, at the grantee’s request, which shall be made in its sole
discretion, the grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate
a transfer of its cable system to a qualified third party. During such a
period of time, grantee is authorized to continue to operate pursuant to the
terms of its prior franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization
exceed a period of time greater than six months from the effective date of
such revocation. If, at the end of that time, the grantee is unsuccessful in
procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its cable system which is
reasonably acceptable to the city, the grantee and the city may avail
themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it
being further agreed that the grantee’s continued operation during the six
month period shall not be deemed a waiver nor an extinguishment of any rights
of either the city or the grantee.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.40  RECEIVERSHIP.



   The city shall have the right to cancel the franchise 120 days after
the appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the
business of the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy
or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall
have been vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days, or unless:



   (A)   Within 120 days after his/her election or appointment, such
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this
chapter and the franchise and remedied all defaults thereunder; and



   (B)   Such receiver or trustee, within the 120 days, shall have
executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by
each and every provision of this chapter and the franchise granted to the
grantee.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.41  COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, SEVERABILITY.



   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the
contrary, the grantee shall at all times comply with all lawful and generally
applicable laws and regulations of the state and federal government or any
administrative agencies thereof.



   (B)   If any section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision hereof
is determined to be illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction or by any state or federal regulatory authority having
jurisdiction thereof, such determination shall have no effect on the validity
of any other section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision hereof, all of
which will remain in full force and effect for the term of the franchise, or
any renewal or renewals thereof.



(Ord. 1846, passed 12-7-98)



§ 114.42  LANDLORD/TENANT.



   (A)   Interference with cable service prohibited.  Neither the
owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling nor his agent or
representative shall interfere with the right of any tenant or lawful
resident thereof to receive cable service, including, but not limited to,
cable installation or maintenance from a cable system regulated by and
lawfully operating under a valid and existing franchise issued by the city.



   (B)   Gratuities and payments to permit service prohibited. Neither
the owner of any multiple unit residential dwelling nor his agent or
representative shall ask, demand or receive any payment, service or gratuity
in any form as a condition for permitting or cooperating with the
installation of cable service to the dwelling unit occupied by a tenant or
resident requesting cable service.



   (C)   Penalties and charges to tenants for service prohibited.
Neither the owner or any multiple unit residential dwelling nor his agent or
representative shall penalize, charge or surcharge a tenant or resident or
forfeit or threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or resident, or
discriminate in any way against such tenant or resident who requests or
receives cable service from a grantee operating under a valid and existing
franchise issued by the city.



   (D)   Reselling service prohibited.  No person shall resell,
without the expressed, written consent of both the grantee and the city, any
cable service, program or signal transmitted by a cable system operating
under a franchise issued by the city.



   (E)   Protection of property permitted.  Nothing in this chapter
shall prohibit a person from requiring that cable system facilities conform

safety, functioning, and safety of persons or property.

without reasonable justification for the delay (including advance notice of
being out of service or being unavailable for service); failing to follow
directions given by fire, police, or accident scene personnel; failure to
properly clear debris from accident scenes; responding to an
accident/incident location without being dispatched by the Police Department
and actively soliciting accident/ incident scene business; failure to
satisfactorily perform at an accident/incident location and other matters
perceived to be counterproductive to the efficient handling of an
accident/incident site; and failure to use a vehicle storage facility meeting
the requirements of division (C) of this section. Indefinite suspension or
removal for prolonged periods of time from the rotation list is at the

owner has no preference as to a wrecker business, or in the event that the
owner or operator of such vehicle (whether or not such vehicle has been
involved in an accident/incident) is arrested and in the opinion of the
arresting officer such vehicle cannot or should not be released to another
person designated by such owner or operator, then the investigating or
arresting officer, as the case may be, shall communicate such fact to the
police dispatcher. On receiving such communication, the police dispatcher
shall call the wrecker business next in line on the rotation list to tow such
vehicle to a vehicle storage facility within the corporate limits of the city
which meets all of the requirements of this chapter. Provided, however, where
the wrecker business so called does not arrive at the location given to it by
the police dispatcher within 15 minutes after receiving such call, the police
dispatcher shall cancel such call and call the wrecker business next in line
on the list to tow such vehicle.



   (F)   The police dispatcher shall have the right to call any wrecker
business within or without the city not on the rotation list should all the

§ 121.25  WRECKER SELECTION FORM; CONTENTS AND USE.



   (A)   Contents.  The Chief of Police shall cause a wrecker
selection form to be prepared which shall:



      (1)   Contain a statement by the owner of the disabled vehicle
designating in blank spaces therein the wrecker company (one authorized under
this chapter to engage in the wrecker business) which he desires to remove
the disabled vehicle and the place to which he desires the vehicle removed;



      (2)   Contain a statement authorizing any police officer to
call the designated wrecker company to remove the disabled vehicle;



      (3)   Contain a statement in the alternative that the owner
has no preference as to a wrecker company and authorizes any police officer
to call the wrecker company next in line on the wrecker rotation list
maintained at police headquarters and a statement that he desires the vehicle
to be removed to the place designated by him in a blank space therein; and



      (4)   Provide space for signature of the owner of the vehicle.



('68 Code, § 7-8)



   (B)   Use.



      (1)   When a police officer investigating an accident
determines that any vehicle which has been involved in a collision or
accident upon a public street is unable to proceed safely under his own
power, or when the owner thereof is physically unable to drive such vehicle,
such officer shall request the owner to designate on a wrecker selection form
the wrecker company the owner desires to remove the vehicle. Such designation
by the owner shall be indicated on the form and when completed shall be
signed by the owner. The police officer shall give a copy of the
authorization thus made on the form to the owner and shall retain for record
the original thereof. Upon leaving duty on the same day, the police officer
shall place such original in a well-bound book in the Police Department
provided for that purpose.



      (2)   When the owner has designated the wrecker company
desired, the police officer shall communicate the fact immediately to Police
Depart- ment headquarters, and it shall be the duty of the officer receiving
such information at headquarters to call the designated company to send a
wrecker to the scene of the accident or collision.



      (3)   Provided, however, that the provisions of divisions
(B)(1) and (2) of this section shall not apply to any accident occurring on
any bridge within the city limits; whenever any police officer investigating
any accident determines that the accident has occurred on any bridge within
the city limits, the officer may call a wrecker using the wrecker rotation
list system specified in this chapter, without first attempting to have the
owner designate a wrecker of his preference. This provision is made necessary
by the fact that a special hazard is created by an accident on a bridge and
it is imperative that the emergency and congestion created thereby be
relieved as rapidly as possible.

   (A)   Failure of the wrecker business called to respond with an
appropriate wrecker at the scene of the collision within 20 minutes of
notification, without justification acceptable to the Police Department,
shall cause the permit holder to forfeit that call on the next wrecker
business upon the wrecker rotation list. Failure to respond within 20 minutes
to two successive rotation list duty calls, without justification acceptable
to the Police Department during a six-month period, shall be cause for the
wrecker business to be passed over for a 30- day period at wrecker rotation
list duty. A wrecker business which has been passed over two times within a

the Police Department shall require the wrecker business holding the vehicle
to release it to the owner. The city shall not be responsible for damages to

the vehicle. This section shall not apply to vehicles held by the Police
Department under authority of state and federal laws.

§ 130.21  PURPOSES; FINDINGS; CONCLUSIONS.



   (A)   This subchapter is enacted in accordance with the prevailing
community standards and regulations for the conduct of minors on streets, in
public places and in private businesses during normal school hours, at night,
and during early morning hours for the good of minors in the city, to promote
family responsibility here, and for the public good, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the city.



   (B)   The City Council finds that the curfew established by this
curfew ordinance meets a very real local need and should, based on the
published experiences of other local governments, be a significant factor in
minimizing juvenile delinquency in the city in the years ahead. The community
sense of the proper time for the cessation of all outdoor activities by
minors on the streets, in public places and in private businesses, is
reflected in the curfew hours declared by this subchapter which takes into
consideration those hours when minors are normally in school as well as those
dangerous nocturnal and early morning hours when the accumulation of minors
poses a special risk due to their special susceptibility to peer pressure,
their immaturity and their lack of experience,  all tendencies normally
associated with those of youthful years.



   (C)   The City Council finds that the city is not overcrowded. Local
school facilities and adequate indoor living space permits minors in the city
to healthfully occupy their time during daytime and nighttime hours.
Commercial recreational facilities are almost nonexistent and there is little
or nothing for minors to do outdoors, but roam the streets and frequent the
commercial establishments of the city which are open after the curfew hours
which this subchapter declares.



   (D)   The City Council finds that minors roaming the streets, public
places and frequenting commercial establishments during the curfew hours
which this curfew ordinance declares constitutes a public nuisance which
should be abated as hereinafter provided.



   (E)   The City Council finds that school hours should generally be
used for educational activities by minors.



   (F)   Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the
norm. Legal sanctions to enforce such results have had a demonstrated
effectiveness over the years. As parental control increases, the likelihood
of juvenile delinquency decreases. There is a need for daytime and nighttime
curfew hours for minors in order to achieve, under local conditions, the
purposes hereinbefore stated.

see § 130.98



§ 130.24  DEFENSES.



   (A)   It is a defense to prosecution of a minor under this
subchapter for such minor being in or upon the streets, public places or
commercial establishments within the city during the daytime or nighttime
hours designated by this subchapter as times at which it is unlawful for such
minor to remain in or upon such streets, public places or commercial
establishments when such minor is:



      (1)   Accompanied by a parent having custody of such minor.



      (2)   Accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such
minor having custody to take said parent’s place in accompanying said minor
for a designated period of time. For the purposes of this subchapter it shall
be presumed that a step-parent of a minor who is accompanying such minor has
been so authorized by a parent of a minor to take such parent’s place in
accompanying said minor.



      (3)   Exercising his or her rights under the First Amendment
to the United States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion,
freedom of speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the
bona fides of such exercise by first delivering to the Chief of Police, at
the city’s Police Department, a written communication, signed by such minor
and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor having custody of
such minor, stating the home address and telephone number of the minor and
the parent, addressed to the Chief of Police and specifying when, where and
in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night or during hours
when this subchapter is otherwise applicable to said minor in the exercise of
a First Amendment Right which right shall be specified in such communication.
This written communication shall be delivered to the office of the Chief of
Police at least one week prior to the time specified in such communication as
being the time when the minor will be exercising his or her First Amendment
Right therein specified.



      (4)   Involved in a case of reasonable necessity, but then
only after a parent of a minor or an employee of a public or private school
has communicated to the city’s police dispatcher, orally or in writing, the
facts establishing such reasonable necessity, relating the same to specified
streets at a designated time and a described purpose, including points of
origin and destination. A copy of such written communication, or of the
police record of an oral communication, in either case, duly certified by the
Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it
was received and of the names and addresses of such parent and minor, shall
be admissible in evidence in the Municipal Court of the city as prima facie
proof of the truth of all facts set forth therein.



      (5)   On the residential property where such minor resides, or
where a parent of such minor resides.



      (6)   A student enrolled in a private school who was in fact
released from attending class on the hour charged due to an official school
holiday or in service day. Because of Court rulings requiring that students
being home schooled receive equal protection of law with those in private
schools, children who are being home schooled are also hereby placed under
this defense.



      (7)   Engaged in an organized athletic activity sponsored by
an official group or voluntary association comprised of adults and directly
supervised by an adult or adults.



      (8)   Engaged in an out-of-school educational activity or an
activity of a religious or other voluntary association attended by such
minor. OUT-OF-SCHOOL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY shall include organized trips for
minors to parks, libraries, museums, recreation centers and other such
private and public places so long as such trips are planned or permitted by a
public school, a private school or by a group or association of home
schoolers, and provided that such trips are directly supervised by an adult
or adults.



      (9)   Returning home by a direct route from and within 30
minutes of release from school or from the excepted activities described in
(A)(7) or (A)(8) of this section.



      (10)   A student on his or her regular school lunch break.



      (11)   (a)   Authorized, by special permit from the Chief
of Police, carried on the person of such minor thus authorized, as follows:
when normal or necessary daytime or nighttime activities of a minor,
particularly a minor well along the road to maturity, may be inadequately
provided for by other provisions of this subchapter, then a request may be
made to the Chief of Police, either for a regulation as provided in (A)(12)
of this section or for a special permit under this division (A)(11), as the
circumstances warrant. Upon the Chief of Police’s finding of necessity for
the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a written application by a
minor and by a parent of such minor, if feasible, stating:



            1.   The home, age and address of such minor;



            2.   The name, address and telephone number of a
parent thereof;



            3.   The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and
hair and other physical characteristics of such minor;



            4.   The reason or necessity which requires each
minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours otherwise prohibited;



            5.   The street or route and the beginning and
ending of the period of time involved by date and hour;



            6.   A photo of the minor; and



            7.   School attended, if any, and current grade
enrolled in by this minor.



         (b)   The Chief of Police may grant a permit in writing
for the use by such minor of such streets at such hours as in the Chief of
Police's opinion may reasonably be necessary. In an emergency this may be
handled by telephone, or other effective communication, with a corresponding
record being made contemporaneously, either to the Chief of Police or, if
unavailable, by a police officer authorized by the Chief of Police to act on
his behalf in an emergency, at the police station. A special permit may also
be issued to minors, ages 16 and 17 with a Texas driver's license, whereby
the parent makes written application as set out above, except division 4. and
5. and where the parent assumes all responsibility and liability for the
actions of the minor, releasing the city from any liability from
non-enforcement of this curfew ordinance as to that minor.



      (12)   Authorized, by regulation issued by the Chief of
Police, in other similar cases for reasonable necessity, similarly handled,
but adapted to normal or necessary daytime or nighttime activities of more
minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis.
Normally such regulation by the Chief of Police permitting use of the streets
should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity
through news media and through other agencies such as the schools, and shall
define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the
period of time involved not to extend more than ten minutes beyond the time
for termination of such activity as therein specified, the reason for such
minors attending such activity and a showing that such regulation is
reasonably necessary and is consistent with the public interest and the
purposes of this curfew ordinance. An application for such a regulation shall
be in writing, signed by the applicant and be delivered to the office of the
Chief of Police at least one week prior to the activity.



      (13)   In possession of a certified card of employment, signed
by the Chief of Police and identifying the minor as outlined in (A)(11) of
this section. Such card shall be renewable every two months when the current
facts so warrant.



      (14)   With parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. From excess of caution, this clearly exempts bona
fide interstate movement through the city. This also exempts interstate
travel beginning or ending in the city.



   (B)   Each of the foregoing defenses, and their several limitations,
such as provisions for notification,  shall be severable.

§ 130.25  PARENTAL AND COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT RESPONSIBILITY.



   (A)   It shall be unlawful for a parent or other person having
custody of a minor as defined in this subchapter to knowingly permit or by
inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any city street
in violation of § 130.23, under circumstances not constituting a defense
under § 130.24, or otherwise beyond the scope of this subchapter. The term
KNOWINGLY includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to
have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent’s legal custody.
It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a
reasonable community standard of parental responsibility through an objective
test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense that a parent was completely
indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor. It
shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this division by a parent
charged hereunder, if such parent having legal custody of a minor had no
knowledge of such minor’s whereabouts at the time when such minor was cited
for the underlying violation of § 130.23 that forms the basis of the charge
against the parent.



   (B)   It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of a commercial
establishment to knowingly allow a minor to remain at such commercial
establishment during the hours of curfew established in this subchapter
beyond the time necessary to conduct and complete an expected activity
associated with the normal business of that commercial establishment. It
shall be no defense to this subdivision that a minor made a purchase, if the
minor did not immediately make such purchase upon arrival and depart
immediately thereafter. It shall be a defense to prosecution under this
subdivision that the owner or operator of such commercial establishment has
promptly notified the Police Department dispatcher that a minor or minors who
are present on the premises after hours have refused to depart. A copy of the
police record of such notification, duly certified by the Chief of Police to
be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received, shall
be admissible in evidence in the Municipal Court of the city as prima facie
proof of the truth of all facts set forth therein.

§ 130.26  POLICE PROCEDURES.



   (A)   A police officer of the city, upon finding or having his or
her attention called to any minor in public places, on the streets of the
city or at any commercial establishment within the city who appears to be in
prima facie violation of this subchapter and not clearly subject to any §
130.24 defenses, shall, subject to divisions (B), (C), and (D) of this
section, take such minor to the city's police station where a parent of such
minor having custody shall immediately be notified to come for such minor.
This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of
relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the police supervisor
then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and uniform
enforcement, and recording, thus making available experienced supervisory
personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and records. In
the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate or a
driver’s license or other similar identification, a police officer on the
street shall in the first instance use his or her best judgment in
determining age. The officer may issue a notice to appear as provided in §
33.11 of this code.



   (B)   Where a minor has been picked up pursuant to an apparent prima
facie violation of the daytime curfew provisions of this subchapter the
police officer having such minor in his custody shall, prior to transporting
such minor to the police station, attempt to ascertain whether or not the
minor is enrolled as a student at a public school. If it appears the minor is
truant from attendance at a school at which he or she is enrolled, then the
officer shall as a first alternative attempt to immediately transport such
minor to the appropriate school where the minor is enrolled in attendance,
and release the minor to a truant officer or other school official with the
authority to take responsibility for such minor, if possible. If it is not
possible the officer shall transport the minor to the police station and
follow the procedure outlined in the other provisions of this section in
handling such minor. In any event, the officer shall make or cause to be made
a report to the appropriate school truant officer for the public school where
the minor is enrolled in attendance. If it is determined that the minor is
not enrolled in a public school, the police officer shall follow the
procedure outlined in division (A) of this section, in handling such minor.



   (C)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the police officer may deliver
to a parent thereof the minor under appropriate circumstances, as for
example, a minor of tender age near his or her home and whose identity and
address is already known to the officer or may readily be ascertained.



   (D)   In any event, when a minor is taken into custody by a police
officer under this section,  the officer shall, without unnecessary delay:



      (1)   Release the minor to the minor’s parent, guardian, 
custodian, or appropriate school official;



      (2)   Take the minor before the municipal court to answer the
charge; or



      (3)   Take the minor to a place designated by the Chief of
Police as a juvenile curfew processing office.



   (E)   In any event, any police officer who has taken a minor into
custody for a curfew violation under this subchapter, shall, within 24 hours,
file a written report with the Chief of Police or shall participate (to the
extent of the information for which he or she is responsible) in the
preparation and filing of such a report by such supervisor within 24 hours.



   (F)   When a parent having custody has come to take charge of such
minor and the appropriate information has been recorded, such minor shall
immediately be released to the custody of such parent. If a parent having
custody cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor within a
reasonable time, then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities
having jurisdiction over such minor (with referral by the municipal court
judge of the city if required by the statutes applicable to such juvenile
authorities) or the minor may temporarily be entrusted to another relative,
neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent having custody assume
the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or
arrival of such parent.



   (G)   To insure parental notice in the case of a first violation by
a minor, the Chief of Police shall, by certified mail and return receipt
requested, send to a parent having custody written notice of said violation
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement
of this subchapter against a parent of a minor in violation and of the
applicable penalties.



   (H)   In the event a police officer of the city, upon finding or
having his or her attention called to any minor remaining at a commercial
establishment in apparent violation of § 130.25(B), shall undertake action
against such minor under this subchapter, such officer shall first ascertain
from the Police Department dispatcher whether or not the owner or operator of
such establishment has a defense as outlined above under § 130.25(B) by
virtue of having made a report to the Police Department dispatcher as therein
provided. If no such report has been made then the officer shall issue a
Municipal Court Misdemeanor Citation to such owner or operator charging a
violation of § 130.25(B).

   (A)   Any minor who has been twice convicted of a violation of any
of the provisions of the subchapter and who stands charged with a third
violation hereof shall be reported by the Chief of Police to the Brazoria
County Juvenile Probation Department pursuant to the Texas Family Code.



   (B)   At the discretion of the Chief of Police, a similar report may
be made to the Brazoria County Juvenile Probation Department concerning any
other minor who has been taken into custody for a curfew violation, whenever
the Chief deems it appropriate.



   (C)   The Municipal Court Judge may transfer to the Brazoria County
Juvenile Probation Department any minor offender, whether for a first offense
or subsequent offense, where such judge determines that there is a real need
for supervision of said minor.

§ 130.98  PENALTY.



   (A)   Should any person, firm, or corporation, their agent, servant,
or employee, charged with a violation of any provision of this subchapter, be
convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction, such person, firm, or
corporation, their agents, servants or employees, may be fined any sum not
less than $1 nor more than $500 for each violation, provided however, that
convictions of violations of § 130.25(A) shall be subject to minimum fines
for enhanced offenses as specified by division  (B)  of this section.



   (B)   If, after a § 130.26(G) notice of a first violation of §
130.23 by a minor has been given to a parent or other person with custody of
such minor as defined by this subchapter, such parent violates § 130.25(A)
(in connection with a second violation of § 130.23 by such minor), such
violation by such parent or other person having custody shall constitute a
first offense of § 130.25(A) by such parent or other person having custody
and, upon conviction such parent or other person having custody shall be
fined not less than $25 for such first offense. If in the trial of a second
offense under § 130.25(A), enhanced, it is shown that the said parent or
other person having custody has already been convicted of one previous
violation of said section, upon conviction the said parent or other person
having custody shall be fined not less than $50. If in the trial of a third
or additional offense under § 130.25(A), enhanced, it is shown that such

demolish the building or structure without further compensation than to keep
for the use and benefit of such contractor all salvageable material removed
from the premises. Any cost incurred by the city, including but limited to,
the wages of employees of the city to perform such work, during or in
connection with the repair or demolition of any building or structure, shall
be collected in the manner provided in Section 601.2.4 below. In lieu of
demolishing such building or structure on the premises, the Building Official
may permit such contractor at such contractor's expense to remove or cause
such building or structure to be removed from the premises to a location
within or without the corporate limits of the city under such conditions as
the Building Official may prescribe and agreed to by such contractor in
writing. Provided, however, before removing such building or structure, such
contractor shall agree in writing to indemnify and hold harmless the city and
its officers and employees from any and all claims that might be made against
them or any of them arising out of such removal and if removed to a location
within the city, such building or structure must either be demolished or
repaired to comply with all applicable technical codes of the city within
such time as the Building Official may specify.



   (M)   Chapter 6 of the Standard Code is hereby amended to add
thereto a new section to be known as Section 601.2.4, which shall read as
follows:



Section 601.2.4.  Any costs incurred by the city in the repair or demolition
of any building or structure shall be assessed against the premises on which
such building or structure is or was located by filing with the recorder for
recording in the official records of the county a written statement by the
Building Official, subscribed and sworn to and duly acknowledged by the
Building Official before a notary public or other officer of the state
authorized to administer oaths and take acknowledgments, containing a legal
description of the premises, the name or names of the owner or owners, a
description of the work per-formed, the date on which such work was completed
and a statement of the total cost incurred by the city in connection
therewith. Upon the filing of such statement, the city shall have a
privileged lien on such premises, second only to tax liens and liens for
street improvements, to secure the cost of such repair or demolition,
together with interest at 10% per annum on the total cost incurred from the
date such work was completed until paid. For the collection of such cost and
interest, suit may be instituted and recovery and foreclosure had in the name
of the city. Such recorded statement of the Building Official shall be prima
facie proof of the fact and cost of such repair or demolition and the
reasonableness thereof.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 153.01  AUTHORITY.



   The legislature of the state has in the Tex. Loc. Gov't Code, delegated
the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed
to minimize flood losses.  Therefore, the City Council does ordain the
following chapter.



(Ord 1610B, passed 4-3-89)



§ 153.02  JURISDICTION.



   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city.



(Ord 1610B, passed 4-3-89)



§ 153.03  FINDINGS OF FACT.



   (A)   The flood hazards of areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety
hazards, dis- ruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.



   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage.



(Ord 1610B, passed 4-3-89)



§ 153.04  PURPOSE.



   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:



   (A)   Protect human life and health;



   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;



   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;



   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;



   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and
bridges located in floodplains;



   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future
flood blight areas; and



   (G)   On request, notify potential buyers that property is in a
flood area by making available current FEMA designations as available.



(Ord 1610B, passed 4-3-89)



§ 153.05  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.



   In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following
methods:



   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health,
safety, or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood
heights or velocities.



   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to flood, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.



   (C)   Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters.



   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage.



   (E)   Prevent or replace the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood water or increase flood hazards of other lands.



(Ord 1610B, passed 4-3-89)

to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated
floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and
piers), or sheer walls parallel to the floor of the water, and Adequately
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during
a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30,
AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, D, ELEVATED BUILDING also includes a building
elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case
of Zones V1-30, VE or V, ELEVATED BUILDING also includes a building otherwise
meeting the definition of ELEVATED BUILDING, even though the lower area is
enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls meet the
standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program
regulation.



   EXISTING CONSTRUCTION.  For the purposes of determining rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before the
effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective
before that date. EXISTING CONSTRUCTION may also be referred to as
“existing structures.”



   FLOOD or FLOODING.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:



      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters.



      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface
waters from any source.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP, (FIRM).  An official map of a community, on
which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY.  The official report provided by the Federal
Emergency Manage- ment Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water
surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the Flood Boundary—Floodway
Map.



   FLOODPLAIN or FLOOD-PRONE AREA.  Any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source; (see FLOODING).



   FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM.  Those physical structural works for which
funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been
constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of
the areas within a community subject to a “special flood hazard” and the
extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes
hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees, or dikes. These
specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with
sound engineering standards.



   FLOODWAY (REGULATORY FLOODWAY).  The channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation more than a designated height.



   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE.  A use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship
repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related
manufacturing facilities.



   HABITABLE FLOOR.  Any floor usable for the following purposes: which
includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking, or recreation, or a combination
thereof. A floor used for storage purposes only is not a HABITABLE FLOOR.

control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from
temporary flooding.



   LEVEE SYSTEM.  A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or
levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices,
which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering
practices.



   LOWEST FLOOR.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the National
Flood Program regulations (44 CFR 60.3).



   MANUFACTURED HOME.  A structure trans- portable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
flood plain management regulation adopted by a community.



   START OF CONSTRUCTION.  (For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L.
97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the
permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement,
footing, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure.



   STRUCTURE.  A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured

      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the
structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.



      (2)   For the purpose of this definition SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The
term does not, however, include either any project for improvement of a
structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety
code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register
of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.



   VARIANCE.  A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner
otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements see Section 60.6
of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)



   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section
60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to
be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.



   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION.  The height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of
floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal

§ 153.11  LIABILITY.



   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city or any official or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construc- tion and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures con- structed
below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in § 153.27(B)
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.



   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent
of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of
this chapter.

if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.



   (I)   Prerequisites for granting variances:



      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.



      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:



         (a)   Showing a good and sufficient cause;



         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and



         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extra-ordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.



      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with
the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting
from the reduced lowest floor elevation.



   (J)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction
and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:



      (1)   The criteria outlined in divisions (A) through (I) of
this section are met;



      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.

   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data
has been provided as set forth in §§ 153.07, 153.26(H), or 153.42(D), the
following provisions are required:



   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor
(including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a
certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the standard of this
division as proposed in § 153.27(A)(1), is satisfied.



   (B)   Nonresidential construction.  New construction and
substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial, or other
nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base
flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review
structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall
certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice as outlined in this division. A record of such
certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained by the
Floodplain Administrator.



   (C)   Enclosures.  New construction and substantial improvements,
with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:



      (1)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.



      (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.

or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.



      (2)   All manufactured homes shall be in compliance with
division (A) of this section.



      (3)   It is required that all manufactured homes be placed or
substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM
be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the
provisions of this division (D).

§ 153.43  AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING.



   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
153.07 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special
flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions
apply:



   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth
number is specified).



   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures:



      (1)   Shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no
depth number is specified).



      (2)   Together the attendant utility and sanitary facilities
be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads or effects of buoyancy.



   (C)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a
certificate to the Floodplain Administrator that the standards of this
section, as proposed in § 153.27(A)(1), are satisfied.

§ 153.44  FLOODWAYS.



   Floodways located within the areas of special flood hazard established
in § 153.07, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:



   (A)   Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, and other development unless
certification by a professional registered engineer or architect is provided
demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.



   (B)   If division (A) of this section is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of §§ 153.40 through 153.45.



(Ord 1610B, passed 4-3-89)  Penalty, see § 10.99



§ 153.45  COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS.



   (A)   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established
in § 153.07, are areas designated as Coastal High Hazard Areas (Zones V1-30,
VE and/or V). These areas have special flood hazards associated with high
velocity waters from tidal surges and hurricane wave wash; therefore, in
addition to meeting all provisions outlined in this chapter, the following
provisions must also apply:



      (1)   Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of
the bottom of the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding
pilings and columns) of all new and substantially improved structures, and
whether or not such structures contain a basement. The Floodplain
Administrator shall maintain a record of all such information.



      (2)   All new construction shall be located landward of the
reach of mean high tide.



      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be elevated on pilings and columns so that:



         (a)   The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural
member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to
or above the base flood level;



         (b)   The pile or column foundation and structure
attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on
all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have a 1%
chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year (100-year mean
recurrence interval);



         (c)   A registered professional engineer or architect
shall develop or review the structural design, specification and plans for
the construction and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
for meeting the provisions of this division (A)(3).



      (4)   Provide that all new construction and substantial
improvements have the space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction
or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work,
or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without
causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system.



      (5)   If breakaway walls are utilized, such enclosed space
shall be usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage.
Such space shall not be used for human habitation.



      (6)   The use of fill for structural support of buildings is
prohibited.



      (7)   Man-made alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands
which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.



   (B)   For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a
design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and not more than 20
pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe
loading resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or when so
required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet
the following conditions:



      (1)   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load
less than that which would occur during the base flood; and



      (2)   The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural).
Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall
each have 1% chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year (100-year
mean recurrence interval).

§ 155.021  NON-CONFORMING LOTS, USES OF LAND, STRUCTURES, AND USES OF
STRUCTURES AND PREMISES.



   (A)   Intent.



      (1)   Within the districts established by this chapter or
amendments that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, and uses
of land and structures which were lawful before this chapter was passed or
amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or future amendment.



      (2)   It is the intent of this chapter to permit these
non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage
their survival.  Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved.  It is further the intent of
this chapter that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.



      (3)   A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming
use of land, or a non-conforming use of a structure and land shall not be
extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a
building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be
prohibited generally in the district involved.



      (4)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently carried on.  Actual construction
is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until
completion of the building involved.



   (B)   Non-conforming lots of record.  In a district where
single-family dwellings are permitted, a single family detached dwelling may
be erected on any lot of official record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this chapter, irrespective of its area or width, provided that
yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both,
of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such
lot is located.  Variance of yard dimensions and other requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Board of Adjustment.



   (C)   Non-conforming uses of land.  Where, at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made
no longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or amended,
such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:



      (1)   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or
increased, nor shall be extended to occupy a greater area of land than was
occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. It
shall be prohibited as an enlargement of that non-conforming use, for an
establishment selling beer in a residential zone under a non-conforming use
exception, to sell, in addition thereto, any other form or type of alcoholic
beverage.



      (2)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.



      (3)   If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land

   (D)   Non-conforming structures.  Where a lawful structure exists
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not
be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area,

location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:



      (1)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in any way
which increases its non-conformity.



      (2)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an
extent of more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction,
it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with provisions of this
chapter.

distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.



   (E)   Non-conforming uses of structures.  If a lawful use of a
structure, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be
allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:



      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by
this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in
changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which
it is located;



      (2)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any
parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use
at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall
be extended to occupy any land outside such building;



      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any
non-conforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed
to another non- conforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either
by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that
the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district
than the existing non-conforming use.  In permitting such change, the Board
of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter;



      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in
or on which a non-conforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such
structure is located, and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be
resumed;



      (5)   When a non-conforming use of a structure, or structure
and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive
months or for 18 months during any three year period, the structure, or
structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located;



      (6)   Where non-conforming use status applies to a structure
and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall
eliminate the non-conforming status of the land.



   (F)   Repairs and maintenance.



      (1)   On any building devoted in whole or in part to any
non-conforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months
on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of non-bearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 10% of the current
replacement value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the
building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter
shall not be increased.



      (2)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part
thereof declared to be unsafe by an official of the city whose official
responsibilities are directly involved upon order of such official charged
with protecting the public safety.



   (G)   Uses under exception provisions not non- conforming uses. 
Any use for which an exception is permitted as provided in this chapter shall
not be deemed a non-conforming use, but shall without further action be
deemed a conforming use in such district.

§ 155.024  CLASSIFICATION OF NEW AND UNLISTED COMMERCIAL USES.



   It is recognized that new types of commercial land use will develop and
forms of commercial land use may seek to locate in the city which were not
anticipated at the time the lists of permitted uses contained in this chapter
as originally adopted were developed or were thereafter amended. In order to
provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the
appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of commercial land use
shall be made as follows:



   (A)   The Building Official shall refer the question concerning any
proposed new or unlisted use of land located in an existing commercial zoning
district (e.g., C-1 District, Retail Business), but excluding (a) any uses
permitted in any zoning district other than C-1 or C-2 and (b) sexually
oriented businesses, to the Planning Commission requesting an interpretation
as to which then existing commercial zoning district, if any, such use should
be added. The referral shall be accompanied by a statement of facts listing
the nature of the use and whether it involves sales, processing, type of
product, storage, anticipated employment, transportation requirements, the
amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be
generated and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and
sanitary sewer.



   (B)   The Planning Commission shall consider the nature and
described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the
already listed uses permitted in the various commercial zoning districts and
determine the commercial zoning district, if any, within which such use is
most similar and should be permitted.



   (C)   The Planning Commission shall transmit its findings and
recommendations to the City Council as to the classification, if any,
proposed for any new or unlisted commercial use. The City Council shall by
resolution approve or reject the recommendation of the Planning Commission or
make such determination considering the classification of the unlisted use as
is determined by the City Council to be appropriate based upon its findings.



   (D)   Standards for new and unlisted uses which have been approved
by the City Council may be interpreted as those of a similar use. When the
minimum requirements for unlisted uses which have been approved by the City
Council cannot be readily ascertained, the same process outlined in divisions
(A) through (C) of this section shall be followed for determination of the
new standards for such uses.

   (G)   Where a Planned Unit Development is proposed, the Planning
Commission and the City Council in accordance with the procedure specified in

   (H)   Application and procedure for a PUD classification.  To zone
property as provided for in this section, the applicant must complete all of
the steps in the following process:



      (1)   Pre-application conference - prior to the formal
application for a PUD zoning change, the applicant shall meet with the
Planning Commission to discuss the elements of the PUD including but not
limited to:



         (a)   The project location;



         (b)   The project size;



         (c)   The project’s intended land uses;



         (d)   The variation from normal zoning provisions needed
to implement the plan;

the common areas. Such document shall provide at a minimum a trust instrument
or equivalent device that shall establish an institution, other than the
city, to assure maintenance of the common areas in case of financial or other
emergency.



The purpose of the pre-application conference is to clarify, for the
applicant, the city’s policies regarding planned unit development and for
the city to provide an informal, non-binding option on the acceptability of
the proposal.



      (2)   Preliminary plan -- to receive preliminary approval of a
request for PUD zoning, the applicant shall submit the following:



         (a)   A preliminary plan including:



            1.   A location diagram at a convenient scale; and



            2.   A land use plan at a scale of 1"=100'
illustrating the boundaries of the proposed tract, any existing land uses on
the proposed tract, any interesting or unusual existing features of the tract
including, but not limited to:  topography, vegetation or flooding and
adjacent existing land uses to a distance of 200 feet.  This land use plan
shall also illustrate existing zoning on and within 200 feet of the proposed
development;



         (b)   Two (2) copies of a plan of the proposed
development at a scale of 1"=100' illustrating all of the elements of the
proposal including, but not limited to:



            1.   Land uses and drainage;



            2.   Circulation and parking; and



            3.   Common areas.



         (c)   Sketches and/or elevation drawings illustrating
visually the general features of the proposed plan; and



         (d)   A written statement outlining the applicant’s
views on the relationship of the proposal to any existing adjacent
development.



The Planning Commission and the City Council shall hold a joint public
hearing as specified in § 155.064 (B) and (C). The City Council’s approval
of a PUD shall designate and define the boundaries of the PUD and include
such conditions as the City Council finds are necessary to secure and protect
the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.  Upon the approval of
the preliminary plan by the City Council, such approval shall be binding as
to the general intent and apportionment of land for buildings, stipulated
uses and circulation patterns, but shall not be construed to render
inflexible the ultimate design or final plans of the project.



      (3)   Final plan. To complete the zoning process, the
applicant shall as soon as possible following action on the preliminary plan,
and within one year from said date (which said one year period may be
extended by an additional twelve months at the discretion of the Planning
Commission), submit the following for review and final approval:



         (a)   Two copies of a plan of the proposed development
at a scale of 1"=100' illustrating all of the elements of the proposal and
reflecting all elements and changes required by the Planning Commission
and/or City Council during the preliminary plan review process.  Such
changes shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.



         (b)   Two copies of a legal instrument or instruments
setting forth a plan or method of permanent care and maintenance of open
spaces, recreational areas and commonly owned properties.



   The Council shall notify the applicant of their approval or
disapproval.  The approval shall be by amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and
shall constitute the final step in the process.



   (I)   When considering a PUD, the unique nature of each proposal for
a PUD may require under proper circumstances the departure from the strict
enforcement of certain present codes and ordinances, for example and without
limitation, the width and surfacing of streets, alleyways, curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, public parks, storm drainage, water supply and distribution,
sanitary sewers, etc.  Final approval of a PUD by the City Council shall
constitute authority for such flexible planning to the extent that the PUD as
approved, departs from existing codes and ordinances.

structure.  (National Register Bulletin 24, p. 1)



   SPECIAL DISTRICT. A district established to accommodate a narrow or
special set of uses or for special purposes. The term can signify any
district beyond the conventional residential, commercial, industrial and

of police power controls. (PAS, Report No. 322, p. 34)



   ZONING.  A police power measure, enacted primarily by general purpose
units of local government, in which the community is divided into districts
or zones within which permitted and special uses are established as are

exterior elements visible from a public right-of-way which affect the
appearance and cohesiveness of any historic landmark or any property within a
historic district without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness
from the Historical Commission.



   (H)   Criteria for approval of a Certificate of Approval.  In

available to the property owners of historic landmarks or within historic
districts.

destroyed.  The removal or alteration of any historic material or
distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.

rather than replaced, wherever possible.  In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities.  Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.



      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken
with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.

      (10)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to
buildings, structures, objects or sites shall be done in such a manner that,

essential form and integrity of the building, structure, object or site would
be unimpaired.

Commission, as provided for in divisions (G), (H), and (I).



   (K)   Economic hardship application procedure.



      (1)   After receiving written notification from the Commission
of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness, an applicant may commence
the hardship process. No building permit or demolition permit shall be issued
unless the Historical Commission makes a finding that hardship exists.



      (2)   When a claim of economic hardship is made due to the
effect of this section, the owner must prove that:



         (a)   The property is incapable of earning a reasonable
return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable
return possible;



         (b)   The property cannot be adapted for any other use,
whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return; and



         (c)   Efforts to find a purchaser interested in
acquiring the property and preserving it have failed.



      (3)   The applicant shall consult in good faith with the
Historical Commission, local preservation groups and interested parties in a
diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in preservation of
the property. Such efforts must be shown to the Historical Commission.



      (4)   The Historical Commission shall hold a public hearing on
the application within 60 days from the date the application is received by
the Building Official. Following the hearing, the Historical Commission has
30 days in which to prepare a written recommendation to the Building
Official. In the event that the Commission does not act within 90 days of the
receipt of the application, a permit may be granted.



      (5)   All decisions of the Historical Commission shall be in
writing.  A copy shall be sent to the applicant by registered mail and a
copy filed with the City Secretary’s office for public inspection. The
Commission’s decision shall state the reasons for granting or denying the
hardship application.



      (6)   An applicant for a certificate of appropriateness
dissatisfied with the action of the Commission relating to the issuance or
denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall have the right to appeal to
the City Council within 30 days after receipt of notification of such action.
The City Council shall give notice, follow publication procedure, hold
hearings and make its decision in the same manner as provided in the general
zoning ordinance of the city.



   (L)   Enforcement.  All work performed pursuant to a certificate of
appropriateness issued under this section shall conform to any requirements
included therein. It shall be the duty of the Building Official to inspect
periodically any such work to assure compliance.  In the event work is found
that is not being performed in accordance with the certificate of
appropriateness, or upon notification of such fact by the Commission and
verification by the Building Official, the Building Official shall issue an
appropriate stop work order and such work shall immediately cease. No further
work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work is in effect.



   (M)   Ordinary maintenance.  Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior
architectural feature of a landmark or property within a historic district
which does not involve a change in design, material, color or outward
appearance. In-kind replacement or repair is included in this definition of
ordinary maintenance.



   (N)   Demolition by neglect. No owner or person with an interest in
real property designated as a landmark or included within a historic district
shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to
result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which
would, in the judgment of the Commission, produce a detrimental effect upon
the character of the historic district as a whole or in the life and
character of the property itself. Examples of such deterioration include but
are not limited to:



      (1)   Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical
supports.



      (2)   Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members.



      (3)   Deterioration of exterior chimneys.



      (4)   Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco, mortar or
paint.

foundation, including broken windows or doors.



      (6)   Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous
condition which could lead to the claim that demolition is necessary for the
public safety.

      (2)   If the Building Official shall find that any of the
provisions of this chapter are being violated, he shall notify in writing the
person responsible for such violations, indicating the nature of the
violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it.  He shall order
discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or structures; removal of
illegal buildings or structures or of additions, alterations, or structural
changes thereto, discontinuance of any illegal work being done, or shall take

all requirements of this chapter and that all other reviews and actions, if
any, called for in this chapter have been complied with and all necessary
approvals secured therefore.

for agricultural uses, until a Certificate of Occupancy shall have been
issued by the Building Official or City Secretary.



         (b)   No premises shall be used and no buildings
hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be used, occupied or changed
in use, until a Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance shall have been

these regulations.



         (c)   Certificates of Occupancy and Compliance shall be
applied for coincident with the application for a building permit and shall

Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance have not been complied with, the
permittee shall be given notice of the revocation thereof, and after such
notice, said permittee shall no longer be authorized to utilize the premises
as authorized under said original Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance. 
The decision of the Building Official to revoke the permit may be appealed to
the Board of Adjustment within 10 days from the date of said notice
aforesaid, and not thereafter, during which appeal time, and until a decision
shall have been rendered by the Board of Adjustment on the appeal, said
permittee shall not further act under the provisions of the original
Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance.



         (b)   In any case where a Certificate of Occupancy and
Compliance has not been used within 90 days from the date of issuance
thereof, then without further action, the Certificate of Occupancy and
Compliance shall be null and void.  A Certificate of Occupancy and
Compliance that has not been fully complied with within one year from date of
issuance thereof shall be null and void; provided, however, upon proper
showing of necessity therefore, after application by the permittee, the
Building Inspector may extend such Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance
for an additional period or additional periods of six months at a time.



      (7)   A record of all Certificates of Occupancy and Compliance

      (5)   The purpose of the regulations described in this

shall be accompanied by a site plan as set forth in § 155.023 (D). Temporary
use permits, revocable, conditional and valid for a term period not to exceed
12 months, may be issued by the Board of Adjustment for any of the uses or
purposes for which such permits are required or permitted by the terms of

permit application shall be as established by the City Council, no part of

Board of Adjustment as deemed necessary in the public interest have been met;
and

recommending approval of a specific use permit, the Planning Commission may
impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location,
construction, maintenance and operation, in addition to the regulations of
the district in which the particular use is located, as they may deem
necessary for the protection of the adjacent properties and public interest.



      (8)   Provided that the Planning Commission finds:



         (a)   That the proposed structure or use conforms to the
requirements and intent of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan of the
city;



         (b)   That any additional conditions stipulated by the
Planning Commission as deemed necessary in the public interest have been met;
and



         (c)   That such use will not under the circumstances of
the particular case constitute a nuisance or be detrimental to the public
welfare of the community, the Planning Commission shall make a favorable
recommendation in behalf of the application to the City Council.



      (9)   Every specific use permit granted by the City Council
shall be considered as an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance as applicable to
such property.  In granting such permit, the City Council may impose
conditions which shall be complied with by the grantee before a Certificate
of Occupancy and Compliance may be issued by the Building Official for the
use of the buildings on such property pursuant to said specific use permit;
and such conditions shall not be construed as conditions precedent to the
granting of the specific use permit; but shall be construed as conditions
precedent to the granting of the Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance.



      (10)   Following the passage of a Specific Use Permit
Ordinance by the City Council, the Building Official shall issue Certificate
of Occupancy and Compliance, as provided in division (C) above, and shall
insure that development is undertaken and completed with said permits.



   (F)   Construction and use to be as provided in applications, plans,
building permits and Certificate of Occupancy and Compliance.  Building
permits or Certificates of Occupancy and Compliance issued on the basis of
plans and applications approved by the Building Official authorize only the
use, arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and
applications.  Any other use, arrangement or construction at variance with
that authorized shall be deemed violation of this chapter and punishable as
provided by § 155.999.



   (G)   No building permit or certificate of occupancy and compliance
for the use of any building or structure as a game room for coin operated
machines, other than one used or to be used exclusively for excluded
machines, shall be issued.



   (H)   All recreational vehicle parks, for which a specific use
permit has been granted, shall be operated in compliance with all of the
terms and conditions of §§ 120.24 through 120.26 of this code.

§ 155.061  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT: PROCEDURE.



   (A)   A Board of Adjustment is hereby established which shall
consist of five members and two alternates to be appointed by the City
Council, each for a term of two years. Members of the Board of Adjustment may
be removed from office by the City Council for cause upon written charges and
after public hearing.  Vacancies shall be filled by resolution of the City
Council for the unexpired term of the member affected.



      (1)   Proceedings of the Board of Adjustment.



         (a)   The Board of Adjustment shall adopt rules
necessary to the conduct of its affairs, and in keeping with the provisions
of this chapter. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and at
such times as the Board may determine.  The chairman, or in his absence the
acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of
witnesses.  All meetings shall be open to the public.



         (b)   The Board of Adjustment shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent
or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be a public
record and be immediately filed in the office of the Board.



      (2)   Appeals; hearing notice.



         (a)   Any person aggrieved, or any official or
department of the governing body of the city affected by any decision or
judgment of the Building Official concerning interpretation or administration
of this chapter, may appeal such decision or judgment to the Board of
Adjustment.  Such appeals shall be taken within a reasonable time, not to
exceed 10 days or such other period as may be provided by the rules of the
Board, by filing with the Building Official and with the Board of Adjustment
a notice of appeal accompanied by a fee as established by the City Council
specifying the grounds thereof.  The Building Official shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.



         (b)   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable
time for the hearing of appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due
notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable
time.  At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney.



      (3)   Stay of proceedings.  An appeal stays all proceedings
in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building Official from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the
notice of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and
property.  In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a
court of record on application, on notice to the Building Official from whom
the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.



   (B)   The Board of Adjustment; powers and duties.  The Board of
Adjustment shall have the following powers and duties:



      (1)   Administrative review.  To hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Building Official in the enforcement of this
chapter.



      (2)   Exceptions; conditions governing applications;
procedures.



         (a)   To hear and decide only such exceptions or
temporary use permits as the Board of Adjustment is specifically authorized
to pass on by the terms of this chapter; to decide such questions as are
involved in determining whether exceptions should be granted; and to grant
exceptions with such conditions and safeguards as are appropriate under this
chapter, or to deny exceptions when not in harmony with the purpose and
intent of this chapter. An exception or temporary use permit shall not be
granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:



            1.   A written application for an exception
together with fee is submitted, accompanied by an accurate legal description,
maps, site plans, drawings and any necessary data, indicating the section of
this chapter under which the exception is sought and stating the grounds on
which it is requested;



            2.   Notice shall be given of such public hearing
to the owner of the property for which the exception is sought or his agent
and to all owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the subject
property, such notice to be given not less than 10 days before the date set
for hearing, to all such owners who have rendered their said property for
city taxes as the ownership appears on the last approved city tax roll. 
Such notice may be served by depositing same, properly addressed and postage
paid, in the city post office. Notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall also be given by one publication in the official newspaper at least 15
days prior to such hearing.  Failure of owners to receive notice of hearing
shall in no way affect the validity of action taken.



            3.   The public hearing shall be held.  Any party
may appear in person, or by agent or attorney.



            4.   The Board of Adjustment shall make a finding
that it is empowered under the section of this chapter described in the
application to grant the exception, and that the granting of the exception
will not adversely affect the public interest.



         (b)   In granting any exception, the Board of Adjustment
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the
ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the exception is granted, shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter and punishable under § 155.999. The Board of Adjustment
shall prescribe a time limit within which the action for which the exception
is required shall be begun or completed, or both. Failure to begin or
complete, or both, such action within the time limit set shall void the
exception.



      (3)   Variances; conditions governing applications; procedures.



         (a)   To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship.  A variance
from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by the Board of
Adjustment unless and until:



            1.   A written application for variance together
with fee is submitted, accompanied by an accurate legal description, maps,
site plans, drawings and any necessary data, demonstrating:



               a.   That special conditions and
circumstances exist which are peculiar to the



land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.



               b.   That literal interpretation of the
provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly
enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this
chapter.



               c.   That the special conditions and
circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant.



               d.   That granting the variance requested
will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this
chapter to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.



               e.   No non-conforming use of neighboring
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district and no permitted use of
lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.



            2.   Notice of public hearing shall be given as in
division (B)(2)(a) 2. above.



            3.   The public hearing shall be held.  Any party
may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.



            4.   The Board of Adjustment shall make findings
that the requirements of division (B)(3)(a)(1) above have been met.



            5.   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a
finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of
the variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that will make
possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.



            6.   The Board of Adjustment shall further make a
finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.



         (b)   In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment
may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this
chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the
terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter and punishable under § 155.999.



         (c)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of
Adjustment grant a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of
this chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said district.



      (4)   Decisions of the Board of Adjustment.



         (a)   In exercising the above mentioned powers, the
Board of Adjustment may, so long as such action is in conformity with the
terms of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
order, requirements, decision or determination appealed from and may make
such order, requirements, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and
to that end shall have powers of the administrative official from whom the
appeal is taken.



         (b)   The concurring vote of four of the members of the
Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or
determination of the Building Official, or to decide in favor of the
applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter,
or to effect any variation in the application of this chapter.



   (C)   Appeals from the Board of Adjustment.  Any person or persons,
or any board, taxpayer, department, board or bureau of the city aggrieved by
any decision of the Board of Adjustment may seek review by a court of record
of such decision, in the manner provided by state law.

      (3)   Accompanying data.  An application for an amendment
shall be accompanied by an accurate legal description, maps, site plans,

proposed amendment.



      (4)   Preliminary review by the Planning Commission. An
application filed by one or more land owner and accompanying data shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review. If a majority of the

be made to the City Council to call a joint public hearing.



   (B)   Joint public hearing.



      (1)   At the request of the Planning Commission,  the City
Council may call a joint public hearing of the City Council and Planning

hearing.  At the conclusion of the joint public hearing,  the Planning
Commission shall deliberate and then, upon motion and second, determine by
majority vote whether to recommend or not recommend to the City Council the
adoption of an amendment which was the subject of such hearing.  This
recommendation shall be entered upon the minutes of the Planning Commission
and communicated to the City Council by the filing of a copy of such minutes
with the City Secretary.  Provided,  however,  if the City Council is
still in session,  such recommendation may be communicated orally to the
City Council by the Chair of the Planning Commission and acted upon by the
City Council as provided in Division (C) of this section at that time.



      (4)   No amendment adopted by the City Council shall be

specified in division (B)(3)  of this section shall apply to the adoption of
such ordinance.



   (C)   Action by the City Council.
