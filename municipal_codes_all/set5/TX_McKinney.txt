PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of McKinney, Texas. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code and subsequently adopted ordinances. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and Timothy MacMartin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Sandy Hart, City Secretary, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

ARTICLE VII. - CODE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT AND PROCEDURES  
DIVISION 1. - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES 
 
Sec. 2-250. - General statement. 
Officials act as fiduciaries entrusted with and responsible for the property and resources of the community and must make governmental decisions, recommendations, and policies free of coercive or other improper influence. Officials must use their position in the best interests of the city rather than for personal interests, whether their own interests or the interests of their family, friends, or business associates. 
It is important that officials understand the ethical conflicts they confront every day; appreciate their fiduciary obligations; and recognize the importance of preventing conflicts from occurring, disclosing conflicts when they arise, and withdrawing from any involvement or participation of any kind in a matter where they have a conflict. 
Public trust requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged; and, that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably addressed through a process which is fundamentally fair. 
Although this article is necessary to identify standards below which an official's conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty, it is understood that a healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be achieved or maintained by mere adherence to standards and that all officials should strive to achieve the highest possible level of ethical conduct. 
(Ord. No. 2018-08-063, § 2, 8-21-2018)  
Sec. 2-251. - Ethical values. 
It is the official policy of the city that: 
(1)  Officials must be independent, impartial, and responsible to the residents of the city. 
(2)  Officials must not have a financial interest, and must not engage in any business, transaction, or professional activity, or incur any obligation that conflicts with the proper discharge of their duties for the city in the public interest. 
(3)  The principles of personal conduct and ethical behavior that should guide the behavior of officials include: 
a.  A commitment to the public welfare; 
b.  Respect for the value and dignity of all individuals; 
c.  Accountability to the residents of the city; 
d.  Truthfulness; and 
e.  Fairness. 
(4)  Under such principles of conduct and ethical behavior, officials should: 
a.  Conduct themselves with integrity and in a manner that merits the trust and support of the public; 
b.  Be responsible stewards of the taxpayers' resources; and 
c.  Take no official actions that would result in personal benefit in conflict with the best interests of the city. 
(5)  To implement the purpose and principles set out in this division, the council has determined that it is advisable to enact a code of ethical conduct and procedures to govern officials. It is the purpose and intent of council to ensure a fair opportunity for all of the city's residents to participate in government, to adopt standards of disclosure and transparency in government, and to promote public trust in government. 
(Ord. No. 2018-08-063, § 2, 8-21-2018)  
Sec. 2-252. - Purpose. 
The purposes of this code of ethical conduct and procedures are: 
(1)  To establish standards of ethical conduct for elected and appointed officials; 
(2)  To provide clear, consistent guidance with respect to such standards by clarifying which acts are allowed and which acts are not allowed; 
(3)  To promote public confidence in the integrity of our city's governance; 
(4)  To provide for the consideration of potential ethical problems before they arise, to minimize unwarranted suspicion and to enhance the accountability of our city's government to residents; and 
(5)  To provide for the fair and effective administration and enforcement of this code of ethical conduct and procedures.

(Ord. No. 2018-08-063, § 2, 8-21-2018)  
Sec. 2-264. - Mayor-council relations. 
(a)  Mayor's responsibilities: 
(1)  The mayor shall be the presiding officer at all meetings. The mayor pro-tem shall preside in the absence or disability of the mayor as provided by the city charter. (All references to "mayor" herein-below shall also mean and include the mayor pro-tem when the mayor pro-tem is presiding as mayor.) 
(2)  The mayor shall have a voice in all matters before the council and may make or second motions and vote on all agenda items requiring council action. 
(3)  The mayor shall preserve order and decorum and shall require council members engaged in debate to limit discussion to the question then under consideration. 
(4)  The mayor will encourage all council members to participate in council discussion and give each council member an opportunity to speak before allowing any council member the opportunity to speak again on the same subject. The mayor, at the mayor's discretion, may limit each speaker's comments regarding a particular agenda item to a specific amount of time to ensure efficient use of time, so long as the mayor announces the time limit in advance and applies it equally to all council members. 
(5)  The mayor is responsible for keeping the meetings orderly by recognizing each council member for discussion, limiting speaking time, and keeping discussion focused on the agenda item being considered. 
(6)  Should a conflict arise among council members, the mayor serves as mediator. If the mayor is a party to the conflict the mayor pro tem, or a council member not involved in the conflict, will serve as mediator. Any mediation that may be required will be scheduled by the city manager or his designee. 
(b)  Council responsibilities: 
(1)  Any two council members may, in accordance with section 2-28 of this Code, request in writing directed to the city manager, with a copy to the mayor, that an item be placed on the council agenda for discussion at a work session meeting or regular meeting. 
(2)  Each council member is encouraged to attend at least one Texas Municipal League sponsored conference each year in order to stay informed regarding issues facing municipalities. 
(3)  It is the responsibility of a council member who misses a meeting to become informed about the deliberations and action taken by the council in their absence. In the case of absence from a workshop session where information is given, the individual council member is responsible for obtaining this information prior to the council meeting when said item is to be further deliberated and/or voted upon by the council. 
(4)  When addressing an agenda item, a council member shall first be recognized by the mayor, confine him or herself to the question under debate, avoid reference to personalities, abusive conduct and personal charges, and refrain from verbal attacks upon the person or verbal attacks on the integrity or motives of members of the public or any other council member or staff member in said council member's motion, discussion or vote. 
(5)  In the absence of a ruling by the mayor on any procedural matter, a council member may move to change the order of business or make any other procedural decision deemed appropriate. The affirmative vote of a majority of the council members present and voting shall be necessary to approve the motion. 
(6)  Any council member may appeal to the council as a whole from a ruling by the mayor. If the appeal is seconded, the person making the appeal may make a brief statement and the mayor may explain his/her position, but no other council member may speak on the motion. The mayor will then put the ruling to a vote of the council. 
(7)  Any council member may ask the mayor to enforce the rules established by the council. Should the mayor fail to so act, a majority vote of the council members present shall require the mayor to enforce such rules. 
(8)  When a council member is appointed to serve as liaison to a board, the council member is responsible for keeping all council members informed of significant board activities. Therefore, regular attendance to the assigned board is of great importance. In the event a council member is absent from three meetings in a twelve-month period that are considered unexcused, by definition, unless the absenteeism is for: (1) vacation; (2) illness; (3) family emergency; (4) court order; (5) jury duty; or (6) business out of town, the city secretary shall notify the council member by letter requesting an explanation for the absences. Unexcused absences include failure to notify the chair or board secretary of a valid reason or good cause for absence prior to a scheduled meeting. After reviewing the explanation for absences, if the mayor finds that the absences are unexcused, the mayor may choose to remove the council member from the assigned board for non-attendance at the board meetings. 
(c)  Code of conduct for mayor and council members: 
(1)  During council meetings, council members shall preserve order and decorum, shall not interrupt or delay proceedings, shall cooperate with the requests of the mayor directed at maintaining order and decorum, and shall obey the rules of procedure adopted by the council. Council members shall demonstrate respect and courtesy to each other, to city staff members, and to members of the public appearing before the council. 
(2)  The mayor and council members shall refrain from making rude or derogatory remarks and shall not engage in personal attacks upon or otherwise impugn the integrity and motives of or belittle staff members, other council members, or members of the public. 
(3)  The mayor and council members shall not use their position to secure special privileges and should avoid situations that could cause any person to believe that they may have brought bias or partiality to a question before the council. 
(4)  Members of the council will not condone any unethical or illegal activity. All members of the council agree to uphold the intent of this policy and to govern their respective actions accordingly. 
(5)  Any member of the council may raise a point of order if the rules in this section 2-264(c) appear to have been broken. This point of order may be raised at any time when a council member notices a violation and is raised by the council member stating "Point of order, Mayor." When recognized, the council member raising the point of order states their reasons for thinking these rules have been broken. 
a.  It is the mayor's duty to make a decision, or ruling, on the point of order. 
1.  The point of order is usually ruled on in one of two ways: The point is declared either "Well-taken," or "Not well-taken," and a short explanation of the ruling is given by the mayor. 
2.  If the point being raised is not clear, the mayor may respond, "The chair is in doubt on the member's point. All those who consider the rules being violated will say ayeOpposed, no The [ayes or nays] have it and [state the action to be followed]." 
b.  A point of order (1) can interrupt a speaker who has the floor; (2) does not need to be seconded; (3) is not debatable; (4) cannot be amended; (5) is decided by the mayor; and (6) cannot be reconsidered. 
c.  The ruling of the mayor on a point of order may be appealed. The appeal is asserted by stating "I appeal the Mayor's decision." The appeal requires a second, is debatable, and requires a simple majority to overturn the mayor's decision.

(b)  Within 20 business days after the council receives a preliminary report and recommendation from the investigating attorney, council will vote and render a decision as to whether the complaint should be:

It will also, where relevant, include a promise by the accused official not to engage in certain actions, the imposition of penalties permitted by this code of ethical conduct and procedures, remedial action to be taken, and oral or written statements to be made.

A resolution of notification may advise the respondent of any steps to be taken to avoid future violations; 
(2)  A resolution of admonition when a majority of the council believes the violation is minor or may have been unintentional, but calls for a more substantial response than a resolution of notification; 
(3)  A resolution of reprimand when a majority of the council believes the violation has been committed intentionally or through culpable disregard of this article; and/or 
(4)  A resolution of censure when a majority of the council believes a serious or repeated violation of this article has been committed intentionally or through culpable disregard of this article by an elected official.

(8)  For purposes of this section, a violation is committed through culpable disregard, or recklessly, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when the person is aware of but consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the circumstances exist or the result will occur. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that an ordinary person would exercise under all the circumstances as viewed from the actor's standpoint.

Editor's note Ord. No. 2019-11-073, § 2, adopted November 5, 2019, repealed art. 14, div. 4, §§ 30-20130-205 and enacted a new div. 4 as set out herein. Former div. 4 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2017-04-042, § 2, adopted April 4, 2017. 
 
Sec. 30-201. - All fuel sold by city. 
(a)  The city, as airport sponsor, owner and operator of the airport, has chosen to exercise its proprietary exclusive right to sell all aviation fuel products at the airport and to be the exclusive developer and operator of fuel farms at the airport. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be interpreted to be a waiver, abrogation, or otherwise inconsistent with such exclusive right. 
(b)  An aircraft owner may self-fuel his aircraft provided the aircraft owner meets certain specific criteria as established by the FAA and this chapter, including the requirement to first obtain a self-fueling license under this division before engaging in any self-fueling activities. 
(c)  All aircraft owners and operators, and all self-fuel operators, must obtain their fuel from the city unless otherwise stated by prior agreement with the city, and by compliance by the self-fuel operator with this chapter. Accordingly, the city has adopted a self-fueling license requirement in the interest of preserving the city's policies with regard to having in place the necessary controls to assure that all fueling operations at the airport are conducted to the same minimum level of safety, efficiency, consideration of the environment, and by persons adequately trained in the storage and handling of fuel products, as set forth in this division. 
(Ord. No. 2019-11-073, § 2, 11-5-2019)  
Sec. 30-202. - Self fueling. 
An aircraft owner may self-fuel owned or exclusively leased aircraft provided the aircraft owner uses its own employees and equipment, and provided that such operation is conducted in accordance with NFPA 30 and 407, Aircraft Fuel Storage and Servicing, latest adopted edition; FAA Advisory Circular 150/5230-4, Aircraft Fuel Storage, Handling, and Dispensing on Airports; Air Transport Association Standards for Jet Fuel Quality Control at Airports, as applicable and as may be amended; and this division. Self-fueling shall be conducted only in those areas designated by the airport director. Aircraft owners may only conduct self-fueling operations after first obtaining a self-fueling license from the airport director. The granting of a self-fueling license shall not be construed as the release, waiver, abrogation or otherwise inconsistent with the city's proprietary exclusive right to sell all aviation fuel products at the airport. A co-op (an organization formed by several aircraft owners for the purpose of self-fueling) is prohibited from engaging in self-fueling operations.

DIVISION 8. - OFF-AIRPORT ACCESS 
 
Sec. 30-300. - Access to airport by off-airport user; lien established. 
(a)  Access to the airport is only granted to off-airport users subject to the terms and conditions of: 
(1)  This chapter; 
(2)  The access permit granted to each off-airport user; and 
(3)  An access agreement executed between the city and the off-airport user, as provided in section 30-304 of this chapter (the access right). The access right shall be for the purpose of allowing the off-airport user to conduct aeronautical activities and aircraft operation on the access area of the off-airport user's off-airport property, so that the off-airport user will have access to airport taxilanes, taxiways, runways, and other airport property. The access right granted under this chapter is revocable and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of an access permit issued and access agreement executed pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Any unauthorized access to the airport property either by foot, vehicle or aircraft is expressly prohibited. The airport director is charged with the responsibility to safeguard the airport by constructing and maintaining at all times a fence or other form of barrier sufficient to restrict unauthorized pedestrian, vehicle or aircraft access to and from the airport property. If access to the airport from an off-airport property is not authorized by the city for any reason (including, without limitation, for breach by an off-airport user of an access permit and/or access agreement) and the city constructs or places a fence or other barrier to prevent access to the airport from an off-airport property, the off-airport user shall, as a condition precedent to regaining access to the airport, reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city in constructing or placing and in removing the fence or other barrier. 
(c)  Any access permit is issued in the city's sole discretion. Any access permit is subject to the initial and ongoing approval and consent by the FAA and by TxDOT Aviation, and is subject to the terms, conditions and requirements of any existing or future grant agreement(s) or grant assurance(s) at or in connection with the airport, and may be revoked, terminated or canceled immediately if any such access permit(s) is in violation of any such grant agreement(s) or grant assurance(s) or any FAA or TxDOT Aviation policy, rule, permit, standard, or regulation, or any local, state or federal law, policy, rule, permit, standard, or regulation, whether currently in effect, hereafter adopted, or as may be amended, modified, changed, or superseded. 
(d)  The city, by and through the airport director, may issue an access permit in the form approved by the airport director, provided that such form shall comply with the terms of this chapter but may include additional terms and conditions as approved by the city, or the airport director, in the city council's discretion. 
(e)  An off-airport user shall comply at all times with and abide by all environmental laws, rules, regulations, standards, and policies of any governmental authority, whether federal, state or local, and including, without limitation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and the city, and shall file any and all reports and provide any such information as may be required by any such governmental authority in connection therewith. 
(f)  An off-airport user shall annually submit, on a date set by the airport director, a property security plan which conforms with the airport rules and regulations and the city's minimum standards for commercial aeronautical activities, in form and content acceptable to, and annually inspected by, the airport director. 
(g)  An off-airport user shall register and affirm the appropriate contact information of the off-airport user as required by the airport director. The off-airport user shall also register with the airport director all aircraft stored or based at the off-airport property by providing the airport director each aircraft's registration number ("N" number), make, model, and the aircraft owner's name and contact information. 
(h)  Access gates used to provide access to the airport from the off-airport property shall be approved by the airport director, and shall use city-approved components that are compatible with other city airport access security systems. Access gates placed by an off-airport user which restrict access from the off-airport property to the airport shall include a sign stating no-trespassing, emergency contact information, the building address for city emergency personnel, and such other information as the city may require. The form and content of such sign shall be subject to the approval of the city. 
(i)  (1)  Lien. The city shall have a continuing lien against each off-airport property to secure payment of any delinquent annual off-airport access fee (or portion thereof), as well as interest thereon, late fees, and costs of collection, including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees. Although no further action is required to create or perfect the lien, the city may, as further evidence and notice of the lien, execute and record a document setting forth, as to any off-airport property, the amount of delinquent sums due the city at the time such document is executed and the fact that a lien exists in order to secure the payment thereof. The failure of the city to execute and record any such document, however, shall not, to any extent, affect the validity, enforceability, perfection or priority of the lien. 
(2)  Enforcement of lien. The lien may be enforced by judicial or non-judicial foreclosure. Each owner of an off-airport property, by accepting an access permit, grants to the city, whether or not it is so expressed in the access permit, a private power of non-judicial sale to be exercised in accordance with Chapter 51, Texas Property Code, as amended. The city may appoint, from time to time, any person including an officer, agent, trustee, substitute trustee or attorney, to exercise the city's lien rights on behalf of the city, including the power of sale. 
(3)  Subordination of lien. The lien provided for herein is subordinate to the lien of any recorded mortgage or deed of trust against an off-airport property but superior to all other liens. 
(4)  Effect of conveyance. An owner that conveys title to an off-airport property shall not be liable for any delinquent annual off-airport access fee that is attributable to the period after the conveyance of the off-airport property. A conveyance of title to an off-airport property, however, shall not affect the lien or relieve the owner that conveys the off-airport property from personal liability for any delinquent annual off-airport access fee attributable to the period prior to the date of the conveyance of the off-airport property. The owner of the off-airport property shall provide to the city written notice of the conveyance of the off-airport property prior to the date of conveyance. 
(5)  Effect of foreclosure. The foreclosure of a mortgage, trustee's sale of a deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof will extinguish the lien described herein as to annual off-airport access fee payments attributable to the period prior to the foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof; such foreclosure shall also cause the immediate termination of the access permit. A foreclosure of a mortgage, trustee's sale of a deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof, however, will not relieve such off-airport property or subsequent owner thereof from liability for any annual off-airport access fee payment attributable to the period after the foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. The foreclosure of a mortgage deed of trust or a deed in lieu thereof shall not release the owner whose off-airport property is being foreclosed, sold at a trustee's sale or conveyed pursuant to a deed in lieu from the owner's obligation to pay annual off-airport access fees attributable to the period prior to the date of such foreclosure, trustee's sale or deed in lieu thereof. 
(6)  Cumulative remedies. This subsection is cumulative of any other remedies, methods of collection or security available to the city under this chapter, the city charter, or any other ordinances, laws, rules, regulations, standards, or permits of the city, the state, or the United States. This subsection does not affect the city's authority to refuse to furnish access to the airport, to terminate an access permit, or to take any other action, when any delinquent annual off-airport access fees exist.

Sec. 30-301. - Security. 
(a)  The airport director shall always require all pedestrian, vehicular and aviation access between the off-airport property and the airport to be controlled at all times using automated controlled-access devices, gate operators, closers with automatic locks or other such reliable devices, or any other means of affirmative control acceptable to the airport director, that serves to continually safeguard the airport from unauthorized access from the off-airport property, and are compatible with city airport access security systems. The airport director, or any other authority responsible for operation and safety of the airport, shall have the right to inspect the off-airport property from time to time for conformance with this chapter and/or the access permit and/or access agreement. 
(b)  The city, the airport director, or any other authority responsible for operation and safety of the airport is authorized by this chapter to take appropriate action to ensure the airport is safeguarded at all times, including the temporary override of gates, closers and locks of damaged or otherwise found to be inoperable gates and/or doors, or the placement of blockades or other types of barriers or fencing material as needed. Such safeguards, when taken, shall be clearly posted and shall not be removed except as authorized by the city, or the airport director, in the city council's discretion. 
(c)  All safety and operational rules and regulations established by the FAA, Department of Homeland Security, or TxDOT Aviation, by any city ordinance, rule, regulation, policy, standard, or permit, or by any other regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the airport, whether currently in effect, hereafter adopted, or as may be amended, modified, changed, or superseded, shall be applicable to each off-airport property.

The number, exact location and design specification of an access taxiway and/or taxilane requested or constructed by an off-airport user shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the airport director and any other regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the airport if so required, taking into consideration, among other things, operational safety and efficiency considerations and compatibility with the airport layout plan. Plans and specifications for access taxiways and taxilanes shall be approved by the airport director prior to construction, and access taxiways and taxilanes shall be designed and constructed to meet or exceed the requirements of the projected use for said access taxiways and taxilanes. An off-airport user may be required by the city to plat an access taxiway and taxilane within the off-airport property in accordance with law. 
(b)  Once constructed, inspected and accepted by the city, that portion of the access taxiway and/or taxilane that lies within the airport shall become the sole property of the city and shall immediately become a part of the airport area unless, at the sole discretion of the airport director, public use and access is restricted for safety or operational reasons. Upon acceptance by the city, that [portion] of the access taxiway and/or taxilane that lies within the airport shall thereafter be policed, maintained and repaired by the city at the city's sole cost and expense, save and except any abnormal wear and tear or abuse of the access taxiway and taxilane on the airport evidenced by one or more off-airport access users who may, under said circumstances, be assessed by the city for all or a reasonable portion of the city's actual cost of repair(s). 
(c)  It shall be the responsibility of the off-airport user to maintain, repair or replace any portion of the access taxiway and taxilane situated within the legal boundary of the off-airport property including but not limited to the taxiway and taxilane surface and subsurface, storm drainage, directional signs, lighting or other navigational aids, fencing, gates/doors and locking devices. If, in the opinion of the airport director, the portion of the access taxiway and/or taxilane situated on the off-airport property is unsafe or presents an operational or safety hazard to the airport or any user of the airport, the airport director may, in his discretion: 
(1)  Take whatever reasonable action he deems necessary to immediately remedy the unsafe condition, and any and all costs thereof shall be reimbursed to the city by the off-airport user; or 
(2)  After giving written notice to the off-airport user of not less than 15 days, the airport director may suspend off-airport access from the off-airport property until the unsafe condition is corrected to the satisfaction of the airport director. 
The off-airport user may appeal the airport director's decision pursuant to the appeal provisions in this article.

Sec. 30-305. - Fee calculation; time of payment; penalty for late payment. 
(a)  Determination of airport area maintenance rate. As of the effective date of the ordinance initially adopting this section, and on or before October 1 of every second year thereafter (e.g., 2012, 2014, etc.), the airport director shall determine the airport area maintenance rate. 
(b)  Adjusted airport area maintenance rate. In order to, among other things, promote the economic development and use of the airport and the development of aeronautical properties adjacent to the airport and for other proper and beneficial purposes, in the discretion of the city, the then applicable airport area maintenance rate may be adjusted in an amount determined appropriate by the city (the "adjusted airport area maintenance rate"), by taking into account an annualized portion of the city's five-year airport CIP reserve. The adjusted airport area maintenance rate shall become effective on January 1 of the year next following such determination, and shall be used in comparison with the adjusted airport area land lease rate, to establish the access fee for any new, renewed or extended access permit issued while the adjusted airport area maintenance rate is in effect. 
(c)  Access fee. For each off-airport property, the access fee shall be calculated as follows: 
Adjusted airport area maintenance rate or adjusted airport area land lease rate (whichever is greater) × (times) Off-airport property (gross land area in square feet) = Access fee 
Example: 
1. 	Airport area annual expenses 	$________ 
2. 	Five-year airport CIP reserve 	($________) 
3. 	Annual airport CIP reserve (line 2 divided by 5) 	$________ 
4. 	Adjusted airport expenses (line 1 plus line 3) 	$________ 
5. 	Square footage of all airport facilities and total off-airport properties 	________sq. ft. 
6. 	Airport area annual maintenance rate (line 4 divided by line 5) 	$_______/sq. ft. 
7. 	Airport area land lease rate 	$_______/sq. ft. 
8. 	Airport area land lease rate adjustment factor 	________% 
9. 	Adjusted airport area land lease rate (line 7 multiplied by line 8) 	$_______/sq. ft. 
10. 	Gross square footage of specific off-airport property 	________sq. ft. 
11. 	Access fee for off-airport property (paid annually, subject to CPI adjustment) (applying line 6 or line 9, whichever is greater, to line 10) 	________sq. ft. × $________ 
= $________ 
 
(d)  Payment. The access fee shall be due and payable not later than the time of issuance of an access permit; airport access shall not be permitted prior to the issuance of the access permit and until the access fee is paid. Thereafter, the access fee shall be paid annually in advance of the anniversary date of the off-airport user's permit, or on such terms as may be mutually agreed to in writing between the city and the off-airport user. 
(e)  Modification of size of off-airport property. If the off-airport property is modified, or if the total square footage of an off-airport property is modified, including any platting or re-platting as may be required, the off-airport user owning the off-airport property shall promptly report in writing such modification to the airport director. Upon such notice, the access permit shall be amended to reflect the modified land area and applicable access fee, and a pro-rata adjustment to the access fee shall be made, as appropriate. The off-airport user shall provide a new survey/plan of the off-airport property and otherwise comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(f)  Modification of off-airport use. If an access permit is issued for an off-airport property and the stated aviation use is subsequently changed, the off-airport user owning the off-airport property shall report such change in use in writing to the airport director, and the airport director shall investigate the report and if the airport director concludes that such use has in fact changed in a manner that modifies the size of the off-airport property, the access permit shall be amended to reflect the change in square footage and any modification of the access fee, if any, and a pro-rata adjustment to the access fee shall be made as appropriate. The off-airport user shall provide a new survey/plan of the off-airport property and otherwise comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(g)  Adjustment to access fee. Commencing on January 1 of the fifth year next following the year of the effective date of an access permit and every five years thereafter (hereinafter referred to as the "adjustment date"), the access fee shall be adjusted as set forth in this subsection. The access fee shall be determined by recalculating the fee in accordance with the provisions of this article.

The appellant must file with the city council and the airport director a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal. The appeal must be filed within a reasonable time as determined by the rules of the city council. On receiving the notice, the airport director shall immediately transmit to the city council all the papers constituting the record of the action that is appealed. 
(b)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the airport director certifies in writing to the city council facts supporting his opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the proceedings may be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the city council or a court of record on application, after notice, if due cause is shown. 
(c)  Notice of hearing on appeal. The city council shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matters referred to it, shall give notice of the hearing to the airport director, and shall provide notice of such hearing to the appellant, and to all other persons deemed by the city council to be affected thereby. 
(d)  Decision by city council. The city council shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The city council may reverse or affirm wholly or in part or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination of the airport director as in its opinion ought to be made in the circumstances.

DIVISION 2. - RATE PROVISIONS 
 
Sec. 54-140. - Rates for basic service tier. 
(a)  Regulation; compliance; maximum monthly charge. Basic service tier rates are subject to regulation by the city in order to ensure that they are in compliance with the requirements of 47 USC 543. Rates that are demonstrated, in accordance with this article, not to exceed the initial permitted per channel charge or the subsequent permitted per channel charge as described below, or the equipment charges as specified in section 54-141, will be accepted as in compliance. The maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier offered by a cable operator shall consist of a permitted per channel charge multiplied by the number of channels on the tier, plus a charge for franchise fees. The maximum monthly charges for the basic service tier shall not include any charges for equipment or installations. Charges for equipment and installations are to be calculated separately pursuant to section 54-141. 
(b)  Initial permitted per channel charge. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the initial date of regulation for the basic service tier shall be the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that: 
a.  The city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier; and 
b.  The ordinance from which this article is derived has been adopted by the city. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, rates "in effect on the initial date of regulation" or "in effect on September 30, 1992," shall be the rates charged to subscribers for service received on that respective date. 
(3)  The permitted per channel charge on the initial date of regulation shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
a.  A charge determined pursuant to a cost-of-service proceeding; or 
b.  The charge specified in subsection (b)(3)b.1, 2, or 3 of this section, as applicable: 
1.  If the operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is equal to or below the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the date of initial regulation, then the permitted per channel charge shall be the per channel charge in effect on the date of initial regulation, adjusted for equipment. 
2.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was above the benchmark per channel charge; then the permitted per channel charge is nine-tenths of the per channel charge in effect on September 30, 1992, but no lower than the benchmark per channel charge, additionally adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tiers. 
3.  If: 
(i)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on the date of initial regulation is above the benchmark per channel charge, as adjusted forward for inflation from September 30, 1992, until the initial date of regulation; and 
(ii)  The operator's per channel charge for the basic service tier and equipment in effect on September 30, 1992, was below the benchmark per channel charge; then the permitted per channel charge is the benchmark rate per channel adjusted for inflation from September 30, 1992, to the initial date of regulation, for equipment, and for any changes in the number of channels offered on the basic service tier. 
(c)  Subsequent permitted per channel charge. After the initial date of regulation, the permitted channel charge for the basic service tier shall be, at the election of the cable operator, either: 
(1)  A per channel rate determined pursuant to a cost-of-service showing; or 
(2)  The prior permitted per channel charge previously approved by the city, adjusted for inflation and external costs in accordance with the price cap requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(d)  Price cap requirements. 
(1)  Inflation adjustments. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may be adjusted periodically on account of inflation. Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of inflation shall be based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index ("GNP-PI") published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. 
(2)  External costs. Permitted per channel charges for the basic service tier may also be adjusted for changes in external costs measured on a per channel per subscriber basis. To the extent external cost increases are greater or less than the GNP-PI for the relevant period, the per channel charge will be adjusted accordingly. Per channel charges may not be increased if external costs other than franchise fees increase at a rate less than inflation. Permitted per channel charges also shall be decreased on account of external costs to the extent such costs decrease from previous levels. 
a.  External costs shall consist of costs in the following categories: 
1.  State and local taxes applicable to provision of cable television service; 
2.  Franchise fees; 
3.  Costs of complying with franchise requirements, including costs of providing public, educational, and governmental access channels as required by the city; 
4.  Retransmission consent fees; and 
5.  Programming costs. 
b.  The permitted per channel charge for the basic service tier shall be adjusted on account of programming costs and retransmission consent fees only for programming or broadcast signals offered on that tier. 
c.  The permitted per channel charge shall not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred prior to October 6, 1994. 
d.  The starting date for adjustments on account of external costs for the basic service tier shall be the initial date of regulation or 180 days from September 1, 1993, if the initial date of regulation occurs on or after 180 days from September 1, 1993. 
e.  Changes in franchise fees shall not result in an adjustment to permitted per channel charges, but rather shall be calculated separately as part of the maximum monthly charge per subscriber for the basic service tier. 
f.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming obtained from affiliated programmers shall be the lesser of actual increases or the previous permitted rate level increased by the amount of inflation. 
g.  Adjustments to permitted per channel charges on account of increases in costs of programming shall be further adjusted to reflect any revenues received by the operator from the programmer. 
(Code 1982, § 16-66; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 6, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-141. - Rates for equipment and installation used to receive the basic service tier. 
(a)  Scope. The equipment regulated under this section consists of all equipment in a subscriber's location that is used to receive the basic service tier, regardless of whether such equipment is additionally used to receive other tiers of regulated programming service and/or unregulated service. Such equipment shall include, but is not limited to: 
(1)  Converter boxes; 
(2)  Remote control units; 
(3)  Connections for additional television receivers; and 
(4)  Other cable home wiring. 
Subscriber charges for such equipment shall not exceed charges based on actual costs in accordance with the requirements set forth below. 
(b)  Unbundling. A cable operator shall establish rates for remote control units, converter boxes, other customer equipment, installation, and additional connections separate from rates for the basic service tier. In addition, the rates for such equipment and installations shall be unbundled one from the other. 
(c)  Equipment basket. A cable operator shall establish an equipment basket, which will include all costs associated with providing customer equipment and installation under this section. Equipment basket costs shall be limited to the direct and indirect material and labor costs of providing, leasing, installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment, as determined in accordance with the cost accounting and cost allocation requirements of section 54-142. The equipment basket shall not include general administrative overhead including general marketing expenses. The equipment basket may include a reasonable profit. 
(d)  Hourly service charge. A cable operator shall establish charges for equipment and installation using the hourly service charge (HSC) methodology. The HSC shall equal the operator's annual equipment basket costs, excluding the purchase cost of customer equipment, divided by the total person hours involved in installing, repairing, and servicing customer equipment during the same period. The purchase cost of customer equipment shall include the cable operator's invoice price plus all other costs incurred with respect to the equipment until the time it is provided to the customer. The HSC is calculated according to the following formula: 
HSC = 	(EB - CE) 
H 
 
Where: 
EB = Annual equipment basket cost; 
CE = Annual purchase cost of all customer equipment; and 
H = Person hours involved in installing and repairing equipment per year. 
(e)  Installation charges. Installation charges shall be either: 
(1)  The HSC multiplied by the actual time spent on each individual installation; or 
(2)  The HSC multiplied by the average time spent on a specific type of installation. 
(f)  Remote charges. Monthly charges for rental of a remote control unit shall consist of the average annual unit purchase cost of the type of remote leased, including acquisition price and incidental costs such as sales tax, financing and storage up to the time it is provided to the customer, added to the product of the HSC times the average number of hours annually repairing or servicing a remote, divided by 12 to determine the monthly lease rate for a remote, according to the following formula: 
Monthly charge = 	(UCE + (HSC x HR)) 
12 
 
Where: 
HR = Average hours repair per year; and 
UCE = Average annual unit cost of remote. 
Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of remote control unit. 
(g)  Other equipment charges. The monthly charges for rental of converter boxes and other customer equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as for remote control units. Separate charges shall be established for each significantly different type of converter box and each significantly different type of other customer equipment. 
(h)  Additional connection charges. The costs of installation and monthly use of additional connections shall be recovered as charges associated with the installation and equipment cost categories, and at rate levels determined by the actual cost methodology presented in subsections (e), (f), and (g) of this section. An operator may recover additional programming costs and the costs of signal boosters on the customer's premises, if any, associated with the additional connection as a separate monthly unbundled charge for additional connections. 
(i)  Charges for equipment sold. A cable operator may sell customer premises equipment to a subscriber. The equipment price shall recover the operator's cost of the equipment, including costs associated with storing and preparing the equipment for sale up to the time it is sold to the customer, plus a reasonable profit. An operator may sell service contracts for the maintenance and repair of equipment sold to subscribers. The charge for a service contract shall be the HSC times the estimated average number of hours for maintenance and repair over the life of the equipment. 
(j)  Promotions. A cable operator may offer equipment or installation at charges below those determined under subsections (e) through (g) of this section, as long as those offerings are reasonable in scope in relation to the operator's overall offerings in the equipment basket and not unreasonably discriminatory. Operators may not recover the cost of a promotional offering by increasing charges for other equipment basket elements, or by increasing programming service rates above the maximum monthly charge per subscriber prescribed by this article. As part of a general cost-of-service showing, an operator may include the cost of promotions in its general system overhead costs. 
(k)  Franchise fees. Equipment charges may include a properly allocated portion of franchise fees paid to the city. 
(Code 1982, § 16-67; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 7, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-142. - Cost accounting and cost allocation requirements. 
(a)  Applicability. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. 
(b)  Generally accepted accounting principles. Cable operators shall maintain their accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the city. 
(c)  Accounts required. Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application of the city's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. 
(d)  Accounting level. Except to the extent indicated below, cable operators shall aggregate expenses and revenues at either the franchise, system, regional, or company level in a manner consistent with practices of the operator as of April 3, 1992. However, in all events, cable operators shall identify at the franchise level their costs of franchise requirements, franchise fees, local taxes, and local programming. 
(e)  Cost allocation requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of establishing expenses at the franchise level, cable operators shall allocate expenses and revenues aggregated at higher levels to the franchise level based on the ratio of the total number of subscribers served at the franchise level to the total number of subscribers served at the higher level. 
(2)  Except to the extent indicated below, all categories of costs allocated to, or identified at, the franchise level shall be allocated to the basic service tier based on the ratio of channels in the basic tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area, including nonregulated and leased commercial access channels. These costs shall be allocated to each tier of cable programming services based on the ratio of channels in that tier to the total number of channels offered in the franchise area. 
(3)  Costs of programming and retransmission consent fees, however, shall be allocated only to the tier on which the programming or broadcast signal at issue is offered. 
(4)  Costs of franchise fees shall be allocated among equipment and installations, program service tiers and subscribers in a manner that is most consistent with the methodology of assessment of franchise fees by the city. 
(5)  Cost of public, educational, and governmental access channels carried on the basic tier shall be directly assigned to the basic tier where possible. 
(f)  Common costs. Expenses which cannot be assigned to any single expense or service category shall be described as common costs. Common costs shall be allocated to expense categories as follows: 
(1)  Wherever possible, common costs are to be allocated to service cost categories based on direct analysis of the origin of the costs themselves. 
(2)  When direct analysis is not possible, common costs shall, if possible, be allocated to service cost categories based on an indirect, cost-causative linkage to other costs directly assigned or allocated to the service cost category. 
(3)  When neither direct nor indirect measures of cost allocation can be found, common costs shall be allocated to each service cost category based on the ratio of all costs directly assigned and attributed to a service cost category over total costs directly assignable and attributable. 
(g)  Unrelated expenses and revenues. Cable operators shall exclude from cost categories used to develop rates for the provision of basic service tier and equipment, any direct or indirect expenses and revenues not related to the provision of such services. Common costs of providing the basic service tier and equipment and unrelated activities shall be allocated between them in accordance with subsection (f) of this section. 
(h)  Parttime channels. In situations where a single channel is divided on a parttime basis and is used to deliver service associated with different tiers or with pay per channel or pay per view service, a reasonable and documented allocation of that channel between services shall be required along with the associated revenues and costs. 
(Code 1982, § 16-68; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 8, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-143. - Costs of franchise requirements. 
(a)  The costs of satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels shall consist of the sum of: 
(1)  All per channel costs for the number of channels used to meet franchise requirements for public, educational, and governmental channels; 
(2)  Any direct costs of meeting such franchise requirements; and 
(3)  A reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(b)  The costs of satisfying any other requirement under the franchise shall consist of the direct and indirect costs, including a reasonable allocation of general and administrative overhead. 
(Code 1982, § 16-69; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 9, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-144. - Charges for customer changes. 
(a)  This section shall govern charges for any changes in service tiers or equipment provided to the subscriber that are initiated at the request of a subscriber after initial service installation. 
(b)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods shall be a nominal amount, not exceeding actual costs, as defined in subsection (c) of this section. 
(c)  The charge for customer changes in service tiers or equipment that involve more than coded entry on a computer or other similarly simple method shall be based on actual cost. The actual cost charge shall be either the HSC, as defined in section 54-140, multiplied by the number of person hours needed to implement the change, or the HSC multiplied by the average number of person hours involved in implementing customer changes. 
(d)  A cable operator may establish a higher charge for changes effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple methods, subject to approval by the city, for a subscriber changing service tiers more than two times in a 12-month period, except for such changes ordered in response to a change in price or channel line-up. If a cable system adopts such an increased charge, the cable system must notify all subscribers in writing that they may be subject to such a charge for changing service tiers more than the specified number of times in any 12-month period. 
(e)  Downgrade charges that are the same as, or lower than, upgrade charges are evidence of the reasonableness of such downgrade charges. 
(f)  For 30 days after notice of retiering or rate increases, a customer may obtain changes in service tiers at no additional charge.

(Code 1982, § 16-71; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 11, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-173. - Initiation of review of basic cable service and equipment rates. 
A cable operator shall file its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier, or by November 15, 1993, whichever is later. 
(Code 1982, § 16-72; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 12, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-174. - City review of basic cable rates and equipment costs. 
(a)  After a cable operator has submitted to the city for review its existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment costs, or a proposed increase in these rates (including increases in the baseline channel charge that results from reductions in the number of channels in a tier), the existing rates will remain in effect or the proposed rates will become effective after 30 days from the date of submission to the city; provided, however, that the city may toll this 30-day deadline for an additional time by issuing a brief written order as described in subsection (d) of this section within 30 days of the rate submission explaining that it needs additional time to review the rates. The city may, at any time, require the cable operator to produce additional information, including proprietary information, that the city deems necessary in order to make a rate determination. If proprietary information is provided, the provisions of section 54-175 will apply to such information. 
(b)  Upon receipt by the city, the cable operator's submittal shall be available for public inspection and copying. Comments on the submittal by interested persons may be submitted in writing or orally at a city council meeting held at any time during the initial 30-day review period. Written comments shall be addressed to the City Secretary, City of McKinney, P.O. Box 517, McKinney, Texas 75069, and must be received prior to the end of the 30-day period. 
(c)  If a cable operator submits a proposed rate increase for review that appears to exceed the presumptively reasonable level and does not include a cost-of-service showing to justify the rate, the city will permit the cable operator to cure this deficiency and submit a cost-of-service showing. 
(d)  If the city is unable to determine, based upon the material submitted by the cable operator, that the existing or proposed rates are within the permitted basic service tier charge or actual cost of equipment as defined in sections 54-140 and 54-141, or if a cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing pursuant to this section and section 54-176 hereof, seeking to justify a rate above the basic service tier charge as defined in sections 54-140 and 54-141, the city may toll the 30-day deadline in subsection (a) of this section to request and/or consider additional information or to consider the comments from interested parties as follows: 
(1)  For an additional 90 days in cases not involving cost-of-service showings; or 
(2)  For an additional 150 days in cases involving cost-of-service showings. 
The order tolling the effective date of the proposed rate shall explain why the city could not make the necessary determination, and it shall also provide the cable operator an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in its original filing. During the additional time periods provided in this subsection, comments from interested persons may be submitted in writing, as provided in subsection (b) of this section, or orally during at least one city council meeting during the period of abatement. 
(e)  If the city has availed itself of the additional 90 or 150 days permitted in subsection (d) of this section, and has taken no action within these additional time periods, then the proposed rates will go into effect at the end of the 90-day or 150-day periods, or existing rates will remain in effect at such times, subject to refunds if the city subsequently issues a written decision disapproving any portion of such rates; provided, however, that, in order to order refunds, the city must have issued a brief written order to the cable operator by the end of the 90-day or 150-day period permitted in subsection (d) of this section directing the operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose behalf such amounts were paid. 
(Code 1982, § 16-73; Ord. No. 93-11-40, § 13, 11-2-1993)  
Sec. 54-175. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If the city has required the cable operator to produce proprietary information under the provisions of this article, the cable operator may submit therewith a request that such information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any materials to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(b)  Each such request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from inspection and of the facts upon which those reasons are based. If the request is that the materials be withheld from inspection for a limited period of time, that period shall be specified. 
(c)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the city will not grant routine public access to the materials. A letter to that effect will be placed in a public file in lieu of the materials withheld from public inspection. 
(e)  Provided, however, if a written request for the materials is received by the city pursuant to the Public Information Act, V.T.C.A., Government Code § 552.001 et seq., the city will notify the person providing the materials of the request for the materials. If the person providing the materials requests the city to do so, the city will request an opinion from the attorney general, pursuant to the Public Information Act, regarding the public availability of the materials. If the person providing the materials does not request the city to request an opinion from the attorney general, the city may, at its option, either request such an opinion or provide the materials to the public. 
(f)  If the attorney general issues an opinion or letter ruling requiring the city to make the materials available to the public, the materials will be made available for public inspection. 
(g)  If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the city assumes no obligation to consider the need for nondisclosure.

(3)  As used in this section, "initial rates" means those rates charged by the small system operator on the date on which the city gives written notice to the cable operator that: 
a.  The city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier; and 
b.  This article has been adopted by the city. 
(4)  If the city determines that the small system's certification is in error, it shall so notify the small system operator and shall require the small system to comply with all filing requirements for non-small systems in this article. 
(5)  Subsequent rate filings by a small system operator shall comply in all respects with the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Option 2. 
(1)  A small system, as defined in section 54-110, may certify that the small system's rates for basic service and associated equipment, and subsequent rate increases, comply with section 54-140. A certification by a small system under this section for its initial rates shall be filed with the city within 30 days of receiving written notification from the city that the city has been certified by the commission to regulate rates for the basic service tier. Certifications for subsequent rate increases shall be filed with the city at the same time that notice is given to the small system's subscribers of the proposed rate increase, in conformance with section 54-172. All certifications shall be in writing, shall be signed by the general manager of the system, and shall be verified. 
(2)  Such certification shall be subject to verification by the city on its own motion or upon complaint by a subscriber.

Sec. 54-180. - Refunds. 
(a)  The city may order a cable operator to refund to subscribers that portion of previously paid rates determined by the city to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment, unless the operator has submitted a cost-of-service showing which justifies the rate charged as reasonable. Before ordering a cable operator to refund previously paid rates to subscribers, the city shall give the operator notice and opportunity to comment. The operator's opportunity to comment upon the proposed refunds may be at any meeting of the city council during the city's period of review of the operator's rates. If the city has extended its review period under section 54-174(e), then the operator, prior to refunds being ordered, may request an opportunity to appear before the city council to comment upon the proposed refunds. 
(b)  An operator's liability for refunds is limited to a one-year period, except that an operator that fails to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city shall be liable for refunds commencing from the effective date of such order until such time as it complies with such order. 
(c)  The refund period shall run as follows: 
(1)  From the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction back in time to September 1, 1993, or one year, whichever is shorter; and 
(2)  From the date the city issues an accounting order pursuant to section 54-174(d) hereof, and ending on the date the operator implements a prospective rate reduction ordered by the city or one year, whichever is shorter. 
(d)  The cable operator, in its discretion, may implement a refund in the following manner: 
(1)  By returning overcharges to those subscribers who actually paid the overcharges, either through direct payment or as a specifically identified credit to those subscribers' bills; or 
(2)  By means of a prospective percentage reduction in the rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment to cover the cumulative overcharge. This shall be reflected as a specifically identified, one-time credit on prospective bills to the class of subscribers that currently subscribe to the cable system. 
(e)  Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments.

Building official means the chief building official for the city, or his designee, having responsibility to enforce and administer this chapter. 
Bulb or lamp means the source of electric light. To be distinguished from the whole assembly, lamp is used to denote the bulb and its housing. 
Candela means the unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is commonly called one candlepower. 
Class I lighting means all outdoor lighting used for, but not limited to, outdoor sales areas, recreational facilities and assembly areas, eating areas, repair areas, advertising displays, billboards and other signs and similar applications when color rendition is important. 
Class II lighting means all other outdoor lighting including, but not limited to, illumination for walkways, roadways, equipment yards, parking areas, outdoor security and similar application when color rendition is not important. 
Cutoff means a luminaire light distribution where the candela per 1,000 lamp lumens does not numerically exceed 25 (2.5 percent) at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and 100 (ten percent) at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire. 
Diffusing luminaire means one that scatters light substantially in all directions as contrasted with a directional luminaire which confines its light principally in an angle of less than 180 degrees. 
Fixture means the assembly that holds the lamp in a lighting system. It includes the elements designed to give light output control, such as a reflector (mirror) or defractor (lens), the ballast, housing and the attachment parts. 
Floodlight means a luminaire designed to project its light in a well-defined area. It is directional in character. 
Floodlight beam means the angular spread of light between two orthogonal planes each of which equal ten percent of the maximum candlepower within the beam. 
Footcandle means the amount of illumination provided by one lumen uniformly distributed on one square foot of surface. 
Footlambert means the luminance of a surface uniformly emitting, transmitting, or reflecting one lumen per square foot of surface. 
Full cutoff means a luminaire light distribution where zero candela intensity occurs at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and at all greater angles from nadir. Additionally, the candela per 1,000 lamp lumens does not numerically exceed 100 (ten percent) at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire. 
Glare means direct lighting emitted from a luminaire that causes reduced vision or temporary blindness. 
High pressure sodium (HPS) means a high intensity discharge lamp where radiation is produced from sodium vapor at relatively high partial pressures (100 torr). HPS is essentially point source light. 
Horizontal plane means a line horizontal to the lowest point on the fixture from which light is emitted. 
Illumination means the density of the luminous flux (lumens) incident on a surface. It is the quotient of the luminous flux divided by the area of the surface, expressed in footcandles. 
Incandescent lamp means any lamp that produces light by heating a filament through use of an electric current. 
Installed means the attachment, or assembly fixed in place, whether or not connected to a power source, or any outdoor light fixture. 
Kilowatt (kwh) means a unit of energy equal to the work done by one kilowatt (1,000 watts) of power acting for one hour. 
Light source means a device (such as a lamp) which produces visible energy as distinguished from devices or bodies which reflect or transmit light such as a luminaire. 
Light trespass means light falling outside the boundary of property for which it was originally intended or needed. Also referred to as spillover light or obtrusive light. 
Low pressure sodium (LPS) means a discharge lamp where the light is produced by radiation from sodium vapor at a relatively low partial pressure (about 0.001 torr). LPS is a "tube source" monochromatic light. 
Lumen means the quantity of luminous flux intercepted by a surface of one square foot, all points of which are one foot from a uniform source of one candela. A one-candela source provides 12.57 lumens. 
Luminaire means a device or fixture containing a light source and means for directing and controlling the distribution of light from the source.

Mercury lamp means a high intensity discharge lamp where light is produced by radiation from mercury vapor. 
Metal halide lamp means a high intensity discharge lamp where light is produced by radiation from metal halide vapor. 
Mounting height means the maximum height of the pole from ground level. The lighting fixture shall not exceed the height of the pole. Refer to section 146-129 of the zoning ordinance for maximum pole height. 
Noncutoff means a luminaire light distribution where there is no candela limitation in the zone above maximum candela. 
Outdoor lighting fixture means an outdoor artificial illumination device, whether permanent or portable, used for illumination outdoors and shall include, but not be limited to, devices used for search, spot, flood and area lighting for buildings and structures, recreational facilities, parking areas, landscape lighting, outdoor advertising displays, billboards, signs, public and private street lighting and walkway lighting. 
Photometric means quantitative measurements of light levels and distribution. 
Semicutoff means a luminaire light distribution where the candela per 1,000 lamp lumens does not numerically exceed 50 (five percent) at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir, and 200 (20 percent) at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir. This applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire.

(c)  Should any outdoor lighting fixture or type of light source be changed therein after the building permit has been issued, a change request must be submitted to the building official for approval together with the adequate information to ensure compliance with this chapter, which must be received and approved prior to substitution. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10-113, § I(35-4), 10-3-2006)  
Sec. 58-5. - Illumination. 
(a)  Metering equipment. Lighting levels of outdoor lighting shall be measured in footcandles with a direct reading portable light meter with a color and cosine corrected sensor with multiple scales. The meter shall read within an accuracy of plus or minus five percent. It shall have been tested and calibrated by an independent commercial photometric laboratory or the manufacturer within one year of date of use as attested to by a certificate issued by such laboratory. 
(b)  Horizontal method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted or held not more than six inches above ground level in a horizontal position. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been exposed to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be made when the National Weather Service indicates visibility is six miles or greater such that measurements will not be adversely affected by atmospheric scatter. Measurements shall be made at least one hour after sunset or one hour prior to sunrise, with sunset and sunrise being established by the U.S. Naval Observatory, with the existing questioned light sources on, then with the same sources off. The difference between the two readings shall be compared to the footcandle ratings listed in subsection (d) of this section. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and other ambient light. However, if lighting levels comply with the light sources on then no further reading is needed with the light sources off to demonstrate compliance. 
(c)  Vertical method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted or held at least five feet above ground level in a vertical position, perpendicular to the property line and facing the outdoor lighting in question. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been exposed to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be made when the National Weather Service indicates visibility is six miles or greater such that measurements will not be adversely affected by atmospheric scatter. Measurements shall be made at least one hour after sunset or one hour prior to sunrise, with sunset and sunrise being established by the U.S. Naval Observatory, with the existing questioned light sources on, then with the same sources off. The difference between the two readings shall be compared to the footcandle ratings listed in subsection (d) of this section. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and other ambient light. However, if lighting levels comply with the light sources on then no further reading is needed with the light sources off to demonstrate compliance. 
(d)  Limitations. 
(1)  Limitations on neighboring property. The limit of illumination on neighboring property from one establishment shall be based on the zoning of the neighboring property. Maximum computed maintained and maximum measured footcandles at the neighboring property line shall not exceed: 
Zoning of neighboring property 	Footcandles- 
horizontal/vertical 
Single-family and two-family residential districts 	0.25/0.25 
Multiple-family residential districts 	0.5/0.5 
Agricultural 	1.0/1.0 
Nonresidential districts (excluding industrial districts), rights-of-way and private streets 	3.0/3.0 
Industrial districts (includes the ML, MH and BC districts and PD ordinances with a base district of one of the above districts) 	5.0/5.0 
 
  
Exception: Illumination at interior property lines on contiguous lots in a multitenant, nonresidential development may exceed the above criteria when necessary to provide constant lighting levels of adjoining parking areas, fire lanes and interior access roadways as determined by the building official. 
(2)  Limitations on subject property. The maximum outdoor maintained computed and measured illuminance level on the subject property shall not exceed 20 footcandles outdoors at any point, with the following exceptions: 
a.  Lighting under canopies (such as service stations) shall not exceed 30 footcandles. All other lighting on the site shall comply with the provisions of this chapter; and 
b.  Lighting for car dealerships shall not exceed 30 footcandles within the front yard. The front yard being the area on a lot facing a street extending across the front of a lot between the side lot lines and from the main building to the front lot or street line. The remainder of the property cannot exceed 20 footcandles. 
(e)  Computation of illumination. Illumination at a point may be computed in lieu of measurement. Computation methods shall consist of an Illuminating Engineering Society of North America accepted method, using certified photometric data furnished by the fixture manufacturer, lamp manufacturer, photometric laboratory, or other reliable authority satisfactory to the city. Computations shall be based on new, properly seasoned lamps, new and clean fixtures, and at rated voltage and wattage, with ballasts, lenses, shields, diffusers, and other appurtenances in place, and with proper regard taken for mounting height, relative elevation, natural and manmade objects and industry standard maintenance factors.

Sec. 58-6. - Luminance. 
(a)  Calculations generally. If the chief building official determines that the illumination measurements are not practical and no other means of measuring fixture luminance is immediately available, a computational method as defined in subsection (b) of this section for measuring luminance may be used to determine compliance with this chapter. 
(b)  Luminance calculations using luminaire photometric data. For the purpose of this chapter, the luminance shall be computed by the formula: 
L = 	   I    
  (d 2 + h 2 ) 
 
Where I is the fixture candlepower in candelas in the direction of the point from which the calculations are to be made, d is the shortest distance in feet measured horizontally from the property line to a point directly under the luminaire, and h is the height of the luminaire at five feet above the ground as explained in Figure A below.    
Figure A 
(c)  Luminance limitations. The luminance on neighboring property from one establishment shall be by zoning of the neighboring property. The luminance as calculated in subsection (b) of this section shall not exceed the value by zoning as follows: 
Zoning of neighboring property 	Luminance 
Single-family and two-family residential districts 	0.02 
Multiple-family residential districts 	0.05 
Agricultural 	0.10 
Nonresidential districts (excluding industrial districts), rights-of-way, and private streets 	0.30 
Industrial districts (includes the ML, MH and BC districts and PD ordinances with a base district of one of the above districts) 	0.50

Sec. 58-7. - Effective outdoor lighting. 
The purpose of the effective outdoor lighting section is to minimize glare, sky glow, light trespass and excessive energy consumption through the use of appropriate lighting fixtures, practices and systems, while maintaining safety, security and productivity and curtailing degradation of the nighttime visual environment. The following are requirements for effective outdoor lighting: 
(1)  Full cutoff luminaries shall be required in all outdoor lighting installations unless permitted below. Lamp types shall be permitted or prohibited as specified below: 
Lamp Type 	Class I Lighting 	Class II Lighting 
Low pressure sodium (LPS) 	Prohibited 	Prohibited 
High pressure sodium (HPS) 	Permitted 	Permitted 
Metal halide 	Permitted 	Permitted 
Mercury vapor 	Permitted 	Permitted 
Fluorescent 	Permitted 	Permitted 
Any light source 15 watts and under 	Non-cutoff permitted 	Non-cutoff permitted 
Low intensity neon, krypton, or argon discharge tubes 	Non-cutoff permitted 	Non-cutoff permitted 
 
(2)  The quality of the light source shall be a minimum of 65 CRI (color rendering index) as indicated by the lamp manufacturer's data; 
(3)  Outdoor lighting for signs shall be as outlined in section 134-6; 
(4)  Outdoor lighting shall be constructed and installed in a manner consistent with this chapter and shall be located so as not to produce glare or direct illumination across the building property line or onto rights-of-way and private streets; 
(5)  Outdoor lighting shall be constructed and installed in a manner so as to conform with requirements in section 58-5(d)(1) so as to not produce light trespass; 
(6)  Searchlights are prohibited except as permitted in section 134-5; 
(7)  Outdoor light fixtures used to illuminate flags, statues, or any other objects mounted on a pole, pedestal, or platform shall use a very narrow cone of light for the purpose of confining the light to the object of interest and minimize spill-light and glare. Compliance with this provision shall be subject to approval by the chief building official; and 
(8)  Building facades and architectural features of buildings may be floodlighted when the following conditions are met: 
a.  Floodlight fixtures are equipped with shields and are located so as to limit the fixture's direct light distribution to the facade or feature being illuminated; 
b.  The configuration of the floodlight installation shall block all view to the floodlight fixture's lamps from adjacent properties; and 
c.  The maximum luminance of any floodlighted surface does not exceed the footcandles specified in the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Lighting Handbook for floodlighting surfaces. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10-113, § I(35-7), 10-3-2006)  
Sec. 58-8. - Exemptions; meritorious exceptions and variances. 
(a)  Temporary exemptions. 
(1)  The chief building official, or designee, may approve temporary exemptions from the requirements of this chapter; provided the duration of the approval is not more than 14 days from the date of approval. Temporary exemptions may be granted for two, two-week periods each calendar year per legal business. A two-week period will commence on the day the exemption is approved. The two, two-week periods shall not occur in the same or consecutive months. A legal business shall include any commercial, industrial, or institutional use for which a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
(2)  Any person may submit a written request, on a form prepared by the city, to the chief building official for a temporary exemption request. The request shall contain the following information: 
a.  Specific exemptions requested; 
b.  Type/use of outdoor lighting fixture involved; 
c.  Duration of time requested; 
d.  Type of lamp and calculated footcandles; 
e.  Total wattage of lamps; 
f.  Proposed location of fixtures; 
g.  Previous temporary exemption requests; 
h.  Physical size of fixtures and type of cutoff provided; and 
i.  Such other data or information as may be required by the chief building official. 
(3)  Requests for renewal or exemptions shall be processed in the same way as the original request. Each renewal shall be valid for not more than 14 days. 
(4)  Approval for temporary exemptions will be based on the effect of location and use of outdoor lighting fixtures. 
(b)  Meritorious exceptions. In the development of this chapter, a primary objective has been ensuring against lighting that creates harmful or negative impacts. On the other hand, an equally primary objective has been to provide adequate lighting for safety and reasonable use of property. The provisions of this chapter are not intended to discourage innovation. It is entirely conceivable that lighting plans could be developed that, while nonconforming to this chapter and thus not allowable, have obvious merit and not only being appropriate to a particular site or location but provide for lighting more in keeping with the spirit of this chapter to balance the abovementioned objectives. Meritorious exception proposals shall be considered at a public hearing by city council after the posting of zoning notification signs and a property owner notice as per section 146-164(2). 
(c)  Variances. The city council may hear appeals from the denial of a permit due to lack of conformance with this chapter. Criteria for granting such a variance is as stated in the state statute, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code § 211.008 et seq., as it may be amended. 
(Ord. No. 2006-10-113, § I(35-8), 10-3-2006)  
Sec. 58-9. - Violations. 
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provisions of this chapter or who fail to comply with any provisions hereof shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $2,000.00, and each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable accordingly.

The administrative adjudication hearing shall be held before a hearing officer appointed by the city manager.

(5)  The motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle and being operated by a person other than the owner of the vehicle without the effective consent of the owner;

(8)  The person who received the notice of violation was not the owner of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. 
(g)  To demonstrate that at the time of the violation the motor vehicle was a stolen vehicle or the license plate displayed on the motor vehicle was a stolen plate, the owner must submit proof acceptable to the hearing officer that the theft of the vehicle or license plate had been timely reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. 
(h)  Notwithstanding anything in this article to the contrary, a person who fails to pay the amount of a civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner is entitled to an administrative adjudication hearing on the violation if:

(i)  A person who is found liable after an administrative adjudication hearing may appeal that finding of civil liability to the municipal court by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipal court. The notice of appeal must be filed not later than the 31st day after the date on which the administrative adjudication hearing officer entered the finding of civil liability. Unless the person, on or before the filing of the notice of appeal, posts a bond in the amount of the civil penalty and any late fees, an appeal does not stay the enforcement of the civil penalty. An appeal shall be determined by the municipal court by trial de novo. The affidavits submitted under subsection (d) of this section shall be admitted by the municipal judge in the trial de novo, and the issues must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. A person found liable by the municipal court shall pay an appellate filing fee as determined from time to time by city council in addition to the civil penalty and any other fees due the city.

(a)  The director is authorized to set and charge fees for use of park facilities and for department programs. The director may submit a proposed schedule of fees to the park board and city council for input and approval as part of the city's annual budget process, and the city council may require the director to adjust facility use fees at any time. Such fees may be charged to help offset some or all of the maintenance and operational costs associated with the facilities and resources used. The director may evaluate fees from time to time and revise them as necessary to reflect changes in costs and/or competition to conform to the budget requirements adopted for the department by the city council. Nonresidents may be required to pay a higher fee due to the fact that they are not assessed city ad valorem taxes. 
(b)  The director is authorized to add department programs, increase participation numbers for existing programs and omit programs as necessary in the director's discretion to meet the needs of the community and maintain appropriate cost recovery. The director is also authorized to establish fees for such programs based on a combination of the amounts charged by instructors of such programs, the maintenance and use costs of the facilities involved, the costs associated with administering such programs, and the budget requirements adopted for the department by the city council. 
(c)  The director is hereby granted discretion to reduce or eliminate fees for events or activities that further the city's mission including, without limitation, those events or activities that are highly attended by McKinney residents or which promote tourism and enhance the quality of life. City sponsorship or support of such events or activities may be addressed during the permitting process and/or the city's budget process. 
(d)  All other events or activities will be required to pay all applicable fees and pay for all measurable reimbursable costs associated with them. The department, utilizing normal and customary methods, will determine the amount of reimbursable costs associated with an event or activity. The director is authorized to charge additional fees for commercial and "for profit" events. The amount of such additional fees may be determined as a percentage of gross revenues, as a rental amount or by any other method deemed appropriate by the director.

Otherwise, an application must generally contain the following information, subject to appropriate adjustment by the director depending on the nature of the proposed event or activity: 
(1)  Name, home address and telephone number; office address and telephone number; date of birth; and driver's license number of the applicant, the promoter and of any other persons responsible for the conduct of the event or activity.

* Please note that the combined number of participants and spectators for an event shall not exceed 74 persons. If more than 74 persons are involved as participants and spectators the activity is required to have a special park event permit.

(b)  An application must be filed sufficiently in advance to allow for reasonable staff planning and approval. Generally, an application must be filed at least 30 days in advance of the event or activity for which a permit is sought in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely file an application is sufficient grounds for denial of the application.

(5)  Any involvement or endorsement of commercial enterprise(s). 
(b)  The director may require the applicant to modify an application in order to assist the director in reaching a decision regarding the issuance of an event permit.

(6)  A requirement that the applicant post a reasonable cash deposit or security for the repair of any damage to park property or the cost of cleanup, or both in addition to any projected cost for city services paid in advance of the event; 
(7)  A requirement that the applicant furnish additional sanitary and refuse facilities that may be necessary, based on the use or activity for which the permit is being sought; and 
(8)  Any other safeguard required for the protection of the public interest. 
(e)  If, after issuing a permit, the director becomes aware of new or additional information that demonstrates the event or activity is not in the best interest of the public, the director may revoke the permit. Without limitation, the director has authority to revoke a permit upon a finding of a violation of any rule, ordinance, or law, or upon the violation of any condition or restriction under which the permit for the event was issued. If the director finds that an applicant falsified any information related to a permit application, the director may revoke the permit and deem any fees (including deposits and bonds) paid by the applicant for the event forfeit to the city. 
(f)  Permits are not transferable without the prior written consent of the director. An applicant shall be bound by all park rules and regulations and all applicable ordinances as fully as though the same were expressly stated in the permit. Issuance of a permit pursuant to this article does not waive the requirements of any other ordinance or law. The city, by issuing a permit pursuant to this article, assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever for the event.

(a)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a service retirement annuity if the member has at least 25 years of credited service in that system performed for one or more municipalities that have participation dates after September 1, 1987, or have adopted a like provision under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.202(f).

If the accumulated deposits have not been withdrawn before such time as the member, if living, would have become entitled to service retirement, the surviving spouse may elect to receive, in lieu of the accumulated deposits, an annuity payable monthly thereafter during the lifetime of the surviving spouse in such amount as would have been payable to the surviving spouse had the member lived and retired at that date under an optional annuity described by V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.104(c)(1). 
(c)  At any time before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity, a surviving spouse to whom subsection (b) applies may, upon written application filed with the system, receive payment of the accumulated contributions standing to the account of the member in lieu of any benefits otherwise payable under this section. In the event such a surviving spouse shall die before payment of the first monthly benefit of an annuity allowed under this section, the accumulated contributions credited to the account of the member shall be paid to the estate of such spouse. 
(d)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system and who performed service for this city prior to September 1, 1987 (for which service that employee did not receive credit with the system because the employee was not at that time a member of the system due to his age at the date of his employment) is hereby granted service credit with the system for all of such service (performed after the date of his latest employment by the city) that is prior to September 1, 1987, for which the employee has not previously received credit with the system, pursuant to V.T.C.A., Government Code § 852.105. 
(e)  The rights, credits and benefits hereinabove authorized shall be in addition to the plan provisions heretofore adopted and in force at the effective date of this section, pursuant to the TMRS Act. 
(f)  Any employee of this city who is a member of the system is eligible to retire and receive a "standard occupational disability annuity" under V.T.C.A., Government Code § 854.408 upon making application therefor upon such form and in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of trustees of the system; provided that the system's medical board has certified to said board of trustees that:

Any officer or employee who is found and finally adjudged to be liable for the payment of any claim for damages arising out of the course and scope of employment with the city shall be entitled to be indemnified for such damages to the extent permitted by law, together with any reasonable and necessary legal expenses incurred by such officer or employee in defending such claim; provided that the acts or omissions resulting in such liability were done in good faith and without malicious or felonious intent. For the purpose of this section, the term "arising out of the course and scope of employment" shall not include any action which occurs during a period of time in which the officer or employee is engaged in outside employment or is rendering contractual services to someone other than the city. Whether the acts were done in good faith without malicious or felonious intent and within the course and scope of employment shall be determined by the city council, and such determination shall be final for the purposes of the representation and indemnity of this article; provided, however, that, in the event such representation and indemnity have been denied by the city, and upon a trial on the merits it is determined that the officer or employee was acting in good faith without malicious or felonious intent and within the scope of employment, the indemnification hereunder shall be granted and reasonable legal expenses incurred in the defense of the claim reimbursed. This indemnity shall in no event apply to or cover punitive or exemplary damages where such damages are not recoverable in law or against the city. Further, the city shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim or suit effected without its consent, and the city reserves the right to assert any defense and make any settlement of any claim or suit that it deems expedient.

Such legal representation shall be provided at no cost to the officer or employee, and any officer or employee may have his own counsel assist in the defense at the sole expense of the officer or employee. The officer or employee shall cooperate fully with the city in preparation and presentation of the case, and the failure to cooperate shall waive such officer's or employee's right to representation and indemnity under this article. To be entitled to coverage under this article, an officer or employee must not, except upon advice of the city attorney or when questioned by a police officer at the scene of an accident, give any oral or written statement or enter into any stipulation or agreement concerning a claim or lawsuit. Additionally, one must not, except at his own cost, voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense with respect to a claim or lawsuit without the consent of the city.

(Ord. No. 1748, § 6, 9-1-87)  
Sec. 81-96. - Suits in behalf of city. 
Nothing in this article shall require the city to indemnify any officer or employee for recoveries made against him in suits by or on behalf of the city. The city council may, however, authorize the city attorney to represent any officer or employee in a suit brought by a taxpayer in behalf of the city against the officer or employee.

Sec. 86-39. - Applicability of state law. 
The provisions of this article are adopted under V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code ch. 361. 
(1)  The regulations promulgated in this article cover all aspects of municipal solid waste management under the authority of the state and are based primarily on the stated purpose of V.T.C.A., Health and Safety Code ch. 361, as amended, hereafter referred to as the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. The owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) facility shall comply with any other applicable federal rules, laws, regulations or other requirements. 
(2)  All permits, including any special provisions therein, issued by the applicable state department shall remain in force after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. To the extent that a standard has been changed by this article, the permittee may continue to operate under standards contained in previously issued permits, except for those requirements mandated by EPA 40 C.F.R. §§ 257 and 258, as amended, which implement certain requirements of subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). For those federally mandated requirements, the permittee is under an obligation to apply for a change to his permit in accordance with federal and State law, as applicable, to incorporate the required standard. Timely submission of a request for a permit change qualifies the owners or operators of existing MSWLF units for interim status. MSWLF facility owners or operators with interim status are treated as having been issued a permit modification or amendment until the executive director makes a final determination on the permit modification request or the commission makes a final determination on the permit amendment request. Facility owners or operators with interim status must comply with the requirements of this article upon the effective date of this article. 
(3)  A permit or license shall be required for each municipal solid waste (MSW) unit, as required by applicable law, and the executive director, at his discretion, may include one or more different types of units in a single permit if the units are located at the same facility. 
(4)  The following are some of the rules with which the city's solid waste manager should have a working knowledge: 
a.  30 Tex. Admin. Code ch. 281. This chapter describes how a permit application, amendment or modification is processed and approved; 
b.  30 Tex. Admin. Code ch. 305. The chapter details the preparation and form of permits, applications, amendments and modifications; 
c.  30 Tex. Admin. Code ch. 330. This chapter outlines municipal solid waste management rules. This is the principle rule municipal solid waste managers utilize; and 
d.  30 Tex. Admin. Code ch. 335. This chapter outlines rules covering management of hazardous waste, both industrial and municipal. It also outlines how industrial solid waste is handled and when it can be deposited in municipal solid waste landfills. 
(5)  Regional and local plans. Every region in the state is completing a regional plan. The regions are defined by the existing regional councils of government established by the state legislature. These regional plans outline important data in analyzing the solid waste needs or to help with problem solving. The regional or local plan should be consulted for guidance or consistency in solving a problem or deciding on a course of action. In either case, the solid waste manager should be consistent with the plan, or seek amendment to the plan, before proceeding to implement a solution.

ARTICLE V. - SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES 
 
Sec. 90-304. - Title. 
This article shall be known and cited as the "Small Wireless Facility Siting Ordinance for the City of McKinney, Texas." 
(Ord. No. 2020-07-051, § 3, 7-21-2020)  
Sec. 90-305. - Purpose and scope. 
The purpose and scope of this article are as follows: 
(1)  The purpose of this article is to establish policies and procedures for the placement of node support poles, transport facilities, and network nodes, as they are defined by this article and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 284, within the rights-of-way in the City of McKinney, which will provide public benefits and will be consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city public right-of-way and the city as a whole. The article establishes standards for the siting and design of node support poles, transport facilities, and network nodes. As such, the provisions of this article are intended to regulate and guide the installation of network nodes on existing infrastructure and to regulate and guide the installation of new node support poles and transport facilities when needed. It is the desire of the city to encourage the development of an aesthetically pleasing local environment. It is also the intent of the city to encourage the expansion of wireless technology, as it provides a valuable service to city residents and businesses. It is not the city's goal to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services nor to have the effect of prohibiting, either directly or indirectly, the provisions of small wireless services. It is the city's goal to encourage wireless providers to construct new facilities disguised through techniques of camouflage, concealment, and stealth design, as defined in this article. 
(2)  In enacting this article, the city is establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by network nodes, including without limitation, ensuring that network nodes, transport facilities, or node support poles do not adversely affect: 
a.  Use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways, water facilities, sewer facilities, storm drain facilities and other public ways and places; 
b.  Vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
c.  The operation of facilities lawfully located in public right-of-way or public property; 
d.  The ability of the city to protect the environment, including the prevention of damage to trees; 
e.  The character of residential and historic areas, and city parks, in which network nodes may be installed; and 
f.  The rapid deployment of network nodes to provide the benefits of wireless services. 
(3)  A recent FCC order states that all local jurisdictions must comply with various rules and recommendations on the exercise of local aesthetic, zoning, public works, and fee schedules when dealing with network node (small wireless facility) installations. The FCC order also concludes that local governments function as regulators of their rights-of-way. The FCC's Declaratory Ruling and Third Report & Order concluded that when local governments regulate, they do so as a regulatory function. This article supports this view of local governments acting as regulators. Thus, McKinney, Texas is in clear need of policies that support their role as a regulator of their rights-of-way. 
(4)  The city recognizes its responsibilities under the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and Texas law (V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 284) and believes that it is acting consistent with the federal Telecommunications Act and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 284 in ensuring that development activity does not endanger public health, safety, or welfare. The city intends this article to ensure that the installation, augmentation and relocation of network node installations in the public rights-of-way are conducted in such a manner as to lawfully balance the legal rights of applicants under the federal Telecommunications Act and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 284 with the rights, safety, privacy, property and security of residents of the city. 
(5)  This article is not intended to, nor shall it be interpreted or applied to: (1) prohibit or effectively prohibit any wireless telecommunications service provider's ability to provide wireless services; (2) prohibit or effectively prohibit any entity's ability to provide any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service; (3) unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; (4) deny any request for authorization to place, construct or modify wireless telecommunications service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions so long as such wireless facilities comply with the FCC's regulations concerning such emissions; (5) prohibit any collocation or modification that the city may not deny under federal or state law; or (6) otherwise authorize the city to preempt any applicable federal or state law. 
(6)  This article supersedes all articles, parts of articles or rules adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.

Sec. 98-83. - Created. 
A Historic Neighborhood Improvement Zone ("HNIZ") is hereby created for the purpose of preserving the city's unique and historic neighborhoods while encouraging property owners to maintain and/or rehabilitate their residences. The HNIZ shall be as shown on the graphic labeled Exhibit A attached hereto. 
Exhibit A 
Historic Neighborhood Investment Zone Graphic 
 
(Ord. No. 2007-02-014, § 2, 2-6-2007; Ord. No. 2008-04-030, § 2, 4-1-2008)  
Sec. 98-84. - Historic Neighborhood Improvement Zone Program. 
A Historic Neighborhood Improvement Zone Program ("program") is created wherein owners in the defined geographic HNIZ may receive ad valorem tax exemptions inclusive of land and building improvements based on verified investment meeting specified criteria. This program consists of three levels of participation and corresponding tax exemptions. 
(1)  Level 1: Residential properties which have received the designation of the Historic Marker Program by the HPAB prior to November 19, 2013 are eligible to receive a one-time, 100 percent exemption of the city's ad valorem taxes for a period of 15 years. Residential properties which receive the designation of the historic marker program by the HPAB on or after November 19, 2013 are eligible to receive a one-time, 100 percent exemption of the city's ad valorem taxes for a period of seven years. The process and criteria for receiving the historic marker designation are as follows: 
Purpose: The purpose of the marker program is to encourage owners of historic properties to become actively involved in the preservation of McKinney's historic past through the recognition of historic events, people, and architecture. 
a.  The marker, if awarded, would allow the owner of the building to apply for an ad valorem tax incentive provided the building has been rehabilitated or restored according to the secretary of the interior's standards. 
b.  In order to obtain a marker, the following requirements must be met: 
1.  Written documented history. 
2.  The building must be a minimum of 50 years of age. 
3.  The house must be located within the HNIZ. 
4.  Photo documentation of all four elevations using black and white photos with negatives, color slides, and copies of any available historic photographs. 
5.  Legal description of the property with a location map. 
6.  Site plan of the property. 
c.  The application shall be reviewed by the historic preservation officer (HPO). The HPO may ask for additions or revisions to the documentation if necessary. Once the application is completed, the HPO will send a staff report to the historic preservation advisory board (HPAB) for approval or denial of the historic marker application, with appropriate appeals to the city council. 
d.  If awarded, the owner may purchase and display the marker. 
e.  If the HPAB approves the marker, the applicant may make application to the HPO for a Level 1 tax incentive for consideration by the HPAB, with appropriate appeals to city council, provided the building has architectural integrity and has been properly rehabilitated or restored and maintained. The marker and tax incentive may be sought simultaneously or separately. 
(2)  Level 2: Owners shall submit plans for exterior improvements to residential properties to the HPO. The owner may then receive a letter of eligibility if the improvements qualify for the program. Thereafter, owners who make verified exterior improvements (however limited to comprehensive maintenance and rehabilitation painting, roof, windows, foundation, and siding) consistent with applicable codes, both historic district and building codes, as applicable, in any 12-month period beginning with receipt of a letter of eligibility and having a combined cost in excess of $10,000.00, during that 12-month period, may receive an exemption of 50 percent of the city's ad valorem taxes for a period of 15 years, as finally determined by applications submitted to the building and standards commission. Owners may submit additional applications under level 2 during any period of exemption. If such applications are approved, the exemption period shall be extended from the date of the last approval. In such event, the exemption periods run concurrently until the earliest approval expires and continues until the latter approval expires. 
(3)  Level 3: Owners shall submit plans for improvements to residential properties to the HPO and to the building permits department. The owner may receive a letter of eligibility, if the improvements qualify for the program. Owners who make verified exterior improvements (however limited to comprehensive maintenance and rehabilitation painting, roof, windows, foundation, and siding) consistent with applicable codes, both historic district and building codes, as applicable, or who make verified interior improvements to upgrade interior systems to current building codes (however limited to sanitary sewer lines, fire, HVAC, insulation, electrical, plumbing, or a combination of interior or exterior improvements) in any 12-month period beginning with receipt of a letter of eligibility and having a combined cost in excess of $5,000.00, during that 12-month period may receive an exemption of 30 percent of the city's ad valorem taxes for a period of 15 years, as finally determined by applications submitted to the building and standards commission. If an owner submits plans for additional improvements under level 2 or level 3 during any period of exemption previously granted under level 3, such owner, upon approval of the building and standards commission, shall receive an exemption of 50 percent of the ad valorem taxes for a period of 15 years from the date of such approval. 
(4)  Aggregate Cap (per year): The city council may impose an aggregate cap on the total amount of ad valorem taxes which would be exempted in any budget year under any or all of the levels set forth in subsections (a)(c) of this section. The annual cap shall be exhausted on a "first come, first served" basis, as determined by the actual date the city receives a completed application. The cap shall be a tool to limit any budgetary concerns based on yearly fluctuations in tax revenues, and as such, the annual cap may be raised or lowered each year by the city council. For calendar year 2018 and continuing annually thereafter until otherwise adjusted by the city council, the aggregate cap on exempted ad valorem taxes shall be $250,000.00 per year. 
(5)  Program suspension: The city council may suspend the program at any time. 
(6)  Implementation: The city shall set up an application process providing for the review of applications based upon administrative guidelines promulgated by the HPO, verification of improvements and certification of the exemptions. The administrative guidelines shall be consistent with this ordinance yet provide flexibility in reviewing, granting and processing exemptions. The exemption may continue and be transferable upon sale of the property. Code inspection and periodic checks on annual owner certifications for previously-constructed exterior improvements shall be a key element to verification of new construction, maintenance of improvements and overall maintenance of the property. 
(7)  Suspension of tax exemption: The city may suspend a level 1, level 2, or level 3 tax exemption of any property at any time should the overall maintenance of the property, including but not limited to eligible exterior improvements, fall into a state of disrepair and no longer promote the intent and philosophy of the program. Should the HPO find that a property is in a state of disrepair and does not meet the intent and philosophy of the program, the owner shall be notified of the specific deficiencies in writing and shall have one year to cure the deficiencies from the date of such written notification. If the deficiencies are not remedied within one year, the city council may suspend the tax exemption. 
(8)  Neighborhood empowerment zone (NEZ) overlay under Local Government Code Chapter 378: The neighborhood empowerment zone overlay (NEZ) shall be geographically coexistent with the HNIZ. The NEZ is created wherein development projects in the defined geographic area may receive impact fee waivers based on specified criteria. 
a.  Single family: Within the NEZ, new single family residential construction commencing on a lot of record is eligible to receive residential roadway, water, and wastewater impact fee waivers, provided that the design and completion of the new construction is generally compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the surrounding neighborhood. Prior to construction, an application shall be made to the HPO, who shall determine whether the proposed construction is eligible for the waiver of impact fees. Impact fees shall be collected at the time of building permit issuance and remitted to the owner upon completion and final inspection of compliant construction. The HPO shall make a determination of eligibility for impact fee waivers based, in part, on the "Guidelines for New Construction in the NEZ" attached hereto as exhibit B and made a part hereof for all purposes. Appeals of the HPO's determination of eligibility for impact fee waivers shall be made to the city council. 
b.  Multi-family: Within the NEZ, new multi-family construction, being three or more dwelling units on a single lot and commencing on a lot of record, is eligible to receive roadway impact fee waivers only, provided that the design and completion of the new construction is generally compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the surrounding neighborhood.

All impact fees shall be collected at the time of building permit issuance and remitted to the owner upon completion and final inspection of compliant construction. 
c.  Non-residential: Within the NEZ, new non-residential or vertically-integrated mixed-use (non-residential and residential uses in a single structure) construction commencing on a lot of record, is eligible to receive roadway impact fee waivers only provided that the completion of the construction and development project meets at least three of the following criteria: 
1.  Compatibility. Construction is generally compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the surrounding buildings and environment; 
2.  Amenities. Construction includes enhanced pedestrian and/or streetscape amenities; 
3.  Town Center Master Plan. Development project is consistent with, and promotes the Town Center Master Plan;

5.  Mixed-use. Construction includes vertical integration of residential and non-residential uses in the same structure with non-residential uses on the entire ground floor; 
6.  Job creation. Development project creates one new, full-time job (or correlative FTE) per 200 square feet of gross floor area; or 
7.  Vacant/underutilized site/building. Construction occurs within the vacant/underutilized sites/buildings improvement area as designated in the Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone Number 1 Project Plan. 
Prior to construction, an application shall be made to the HPO that includes supporting documentation of the project's ability to meet the eligibility criteria established for the waiver of roadway impact fees. For projects where roadway impact fees exceed $50,000.00, the HPO shall make a determination of eligibility for roadway impact fee waivers and present a recommendation to the city council for approval or denial.

EXHIBIT B 
GUIDELINES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD EMPOWERMENT ZONE 
New construction in the Neighborhood Empowerment Zone (NEZ) should be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the surrounding homes. New construction in the NEZ should not attempt to recreate or replicate a past architectural style in its entirety but should take cues from the architectural and design elements of surrounding historic structures. No specific architectural style shall be required for new construction in the NEZ. 
The following aspects of new construction in the NEZ should be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is related. These include but are not limited to: height, proportion between width and height of façade, proportion and relationship between doors and windows, rhythm of solids and voids created by openings in the façade, materials, textures, colors, patterns, trims, and design of the roof. New construction in the NEZ should also preserve the existing rhythm created by existing building masses in the neighborhood. 
Height: All new construction in the NEZ should take into consideration the general height of the buildings in the neighborhood and shall also comply with the regulating zoning district. 
Proportion of the buildings front façade: The relationship of the width to height of a building creates a proportion that should be taken into consideration (such as tall and narrow, low and squat, or square). This proportional relationship should reflect the dominant character of the neighborhood. 
Proportion of openings within the façade: This is a relationship of the width to height of windows and doors. For example, a window may be one unit wide and three units high, thus creating a proportional relationship of 1:3. If the majority of the buildings within a neighborhood have this 1:3 relationship, then new design should reflect this proportion as well. Large picture windows or horizontal bands of windows should be avoided. Modern interpretations of historic windows are acceptable if they retain the historic size ratios and pattern of placement on the façade. Doors should also be compatible in proportion. (See Illustration 1) 
 
Rhythm of solids to voids: Rhythm is an ordered recurrent alternation of wall to openings as well as spacing between buildings. This rhythm creates a feel as one moves past a building or group of buildings. The design of a new structure in the NEZ should respect the rhythm of the surrounding neighborhood in terms of its size, distance between buildings on either side, and the spacing of windows and doors. (See Illustration 2) 
 
Relationship of materials: New designs in the NEZ should use materials that are compatible with the neighborhood and should seek to reflect the predominant materials found in the neighborhood. If the majority of existing buildings are brick, then the proposed building should be brick. If the predominant material is lap siding, then the proposed material should be lap siding. The texture and color of the materials should be considered as well and be compatible with the surrounding buildings. 
Relationship to roof shapes: Roof shape includes the type and pitch of the roof (such as hip, gable, mansard, or shed). The treatment of the eaves, rafter tails, soffits, bargeboards, and fascia are important considerations when designing any new construction in the NEZ. For example, if the majority of the existing houses in a neighborhood have a gabled roof, then the proposed new construction should have a gabled roof. Additionally, if the existing buildings in a neighborhood have boxed eaves, then the new construction should seek to either incorporate the same or similar design element. 
Relationships to architectural details: Architectural details include features such as cornices, brackets, columns, lintels, arches, roof crests, quoins, balustrades, doors, windows, and chimneys. New construction in the NEZ should be compatible with the predominant architectural details on surrounding buildings. These details do not need to be copied in the new construction, but they should be reflected in some manner. For example, if the majority of houses in the neighborhood have pediments above the windows, then the new construction should reflect pediment-like features above the windows as well. Additionally, chimneys that are not constructed of historical materials (brick or stone) should be located to the rear of the building in order to reduce the visibility of the modern chimney covering from the public right-of-way. 
Scale: Scale is created by the architectural detailing that relates to the size of a human and by the building mass as it relates to open space. A large building on a small lot has a different appearance when compared to a large building on a large lot. This relationship should be considered when designing for a particular neighborhood. New construction in the NEZ should observe the scale of surrounding and nearby structures. The window and door lines should be similar to neighboring structures. The detailing should be consistent with the size of the building. For example, a small house should not have massive or oversized details and decorations. 
Massing: The term massing refers to how the basic shapes of the building are fit together. Massing can be very simple, such as a single rectangular shape, be more complex with an L-shape, or have a combination of shapes. Additional massing elements are also found among the different architectural styles. For example, in Victorian architecture, elements such as bays, towers, and turrets add to the basic massing of the house. Massing patterns of the neighborhood structures should be considered and reflected in the design of new construction in the NEZ. New construction in the NEZ shall also comply with the floor-area- ratios dictated by the regulating zoning district. 
Directional expression of the front elevation: The use of architectural details and the proportion of the width to height ratio create structural shape. The structural shape will be expressed either vertically or horizontally. A building with a ratio of 1:5 will have a vertical appearance while a ratio of 5:1 would have a horizontal appearance. Tall narrow windows give a vertical appearance while wide windows tend to create a horizontal feel. New construction in the NEZ should observe the predominant feel of the surrounding area. 
Rhythm of spacing and setbacks: It is important that new construction in the NEZ be consistent with adjacent structures in spacing and setback, which sets a rhythm for the block and neighborhood and is a part of the historic character. The setback of new construction in the NEZ should generally be within 10 percent of the setback lines of the adjacent structures. Setbacks for new construction in the NEZ should maintain the existing pattern of setbacks in the block if at all possible. New construction in the NEZ shall also comply with the setbacks dictated by the regulating zoning district. (See Illustration 3) 
 
Variation of styles: If groupings of two or more new homes are being built in the same area, then the new construction should reflect a variation in the styles of homes. It is not appropriate to build the same home or simply change the position of the front porch or the type of window or front door to comply with these criteria.

(1)  Individuals with the following credentials and who are approved by the city shall be recognized as capable of conducting a customer service inspection certification. 
a.  Plumbing inspectors and water supply protection specialists licensed by the TSBPE. 
b.  Customer service inspectors who are currently licensed by the TCEQ. 
(2)  As potential contaminant hazards are discovered, they shall be promptly eliminated to prevent possible contamination of the water supplied by the water system.

b.  The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
(5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
a.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. 
c.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for Ph, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The control authority may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this section. 
e.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards.

Sec. 110-278. - Pretreatment required. 
(a)  Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this division, federal categorical pretreatment standards, and any state or federal pretreatment regulation. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. The city can require the development of a compliance schedule by each industrial user for the installation of technology required to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(b)  Before beginning construction of pretreatment facilities, the user shall submit detailed plans and operating procedures for the facility to the environmental officer for review and approval. The review and approval of such plans and procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
(c)  All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge. 
(d)  All records relating to compliance with the pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the city, state, or environmental protection agency upon request.

(Code 1982, § 31-142; Ord. No. 92-07-19, § 27, 7-7-1992)  
Sec. 110-281. - Bypass. 
(a)  Permitted bypasses. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(b)  Notice. 
(1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the control authority, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
(2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The control authority may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)  Prohibition of bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (b) of this section. 
(2)  The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions in subsection (c)(1) of this section.

(Code 1982, § 31-145; Ord. No. 92-07-19, § 30, 7-7-1992)  
Sec. 110-284. - Upsets. 
(a)  Effect. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (b) of this section are met. 
(b)  Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed contemporaneous operation logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset; if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and the cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or plans to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(c)  Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(d)  Review of claims of upset. In the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion, agency enforcement personnel should review any claims that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No determinations made in the course of the review constitute final agency action subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity of a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(e)  User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

(a)  Industrial users shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). 
(b)  If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: 
(1)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
(2)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and 
(3)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
(c)  Industrial users shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d) and (e). 
(d)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsections (a)(c) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional information. 
(e)  In the case of any new regulations, under section 3001 of RCRA, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(f)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

ARTICLE VII. - MUNICIPAL SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE UTILITY SYSTEM  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 110-394. - Definitions. 
The definitions of Texas Local Government Code § 552.044 are hereby adopted, except as modified here: 
Drainage charge means: 
(1)  The levy imposed to recover the cost of service of the city in furnishing drainage for any benefited property; and 
(2)  An amount made in contribution to funding of future drainage system construction by the city. 
Impervious surface means the area of a structure or other improvement upon land that causes an impervious coverage of the soil under the structure or improvement. 
Property area means the property area of each lot or tract as shown on the land area data maintained by the county appraisal district. 
Service area means the geographic areas within the municipal boundaries of the city. 
Single family living unit equivalent (SFLUE) means a unit of measurement of impervious surface area determined as the average residential house structure or a garage, driveway and other impervious area within the city, to wit: 3,000 square feet. 
Structure means any change or improvement upon land that causes an impervious coverage of the soil. 
Surface water drainage utility system (SDUS) fee means the total drainage charge for a property, including the system-wide fee component and the applicable lake drainage basin fee components based on the number of SFLUEs determined for the property. 
System-wide fee component means the component of the SDUS fee used for the recovery of costs associated with furnishing drainage for all benefitted properties as well as funding of future drainage system construction save and except costs associated solely with NRCS lake drainage basins. The dollar amount of the system-wide fee component is determined, from time to time as provided hereinbelow, by the city council and is set at a dollar figure reflecting the impacts generated on the drainage system by a single family living unit having approximately 3,000 square foot of impervious surface. 
(Code 1982, § 31-211; Ord. No. 2002-03-017, § 2, 3-5-2002; Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 4, 4-7-2015)  
DIVISION 2. - SCHEDULE OF CHARGES 
 
Sec. 110-395. - Schedule of charges. 
Every property owner and city service customer shall be responsible for paying the SDUS fee for the benefited property. Such benefitted properties are charged monthly based on the amount of impervious area on a parcel of property. The SDUS fee has two components: the system-wide component and the lake drainage basin component. The SDUS fee for all properties is computed using the same formula, which calculates all properties in relation to a single family living unit equivalent (SFLUE) based on the impervious surface area on the improved lot or tract save and except as set forth otherwise hereinbelow multiplied by the amount of the drainage charges as determined from time to time by the city council. 
(1)  Determination of SFLUE. 
a.  For single family residential and townhome parcels, one SFLUE per month per parcel. 
b.  For duplex and quadplex properties, one SFLUE per month per dwelling unit. 
1.  The SDUS fee shall be calculated, based on the number of dwelling units, for the entire property and shall be paid by the property owner. The city shall place the SDUS fee on a master meter account billed to the owner or his agent. 
2.  At its sole discretion, the city may prorate the SDUS fee among the separate meters in relation to the number of dwelling units served by the meters; provided the customer provides adequate assurance for payment and documentation of the number of dwelling units served by each meter. 
c.  For mobile home parks, one SFLUE per month per each mobile home pad or trailer pad. 
1.  The SDUS fee for the entire complex shall be placed on a master meter within the property, or, at the city's sole discretion, may be billed separately to the property owner. 
2.  For individually metered trailer pads, the city may, at its sole discretion, bill the SDUS fee on the individually metered accounts. 
d.  For multifamily properties, the number of SFLUE applicable to the property will be individually determined based on the actual impervious surface area of the property rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
1.  In the case of multiple meters on a single parcel, the SDUS fee shall be calculated for the entire property and shall be paid by the property owner. The city shall place the SDUS fee on a master meter account billed to the owner or the owner's agent. 
2.  At its sole discretion, the city may prorate the SDUS fee among the separate meters in relation to the area served by the meters provided the customer provides adequate assurance for payment, complete documentation of impervious area pro rata calculations, and documentation of concurrence by all owners and/or tenants. 
e.  For nonresidential, commercial and/or industrial properties, the number of SFLUE applicable to the property will be individually determined based on the actual impervious surface area of the property rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
1.  In the case of multiple meters on a single parcel, the SDUS fee shall be calculated for the entire property and shall be paid by the property owner. The city shall place the SDUS fee on a master meter account billed to the owner or the owner's agent. 
2.  At its sole discretion, the city may prorate the SDUS fee among the separate meters in relation to the area served by the meters provided the customer provides adequate assurance for payment, complete documentation of impervious area pro rata calculations, and documentation of concurrence by all owners and/tenants. 
(2)  The minimum SDUS fee for any multifamily, nonresidential, commercial and/or industrial property shall be based on one SFLUE per month. 
(3)  The system-wide component. The monthly system-wide fee for all property within the city shall be as determined from time to time by city council. 
(4)  The lake drainage basin component. 
a.  The NRCS lake drainage basins are hereby established as shown on exhibit B, attached to Ord. No. 2002-03-017, which exhibit is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city secretary. The city engineer shall determine whether an improved lot or tract is within a lake drainage basin. In the event of a dispute, the property owner may be requested to provide topographical data to assist in such determination. If an improved lot or tract is located partially within a lake drainage basin, or within more than one lake drainage basin, the improved lot or tract shall be deemed to be completely located within the basin that contains the largest percentage of its impervious area. 
b.  Every property owner and city service customer within a lake drainage basin shall be responsible for paying the lake drainage basin fee associated with that drainage basin, as shown on exhibit A, attached to Ord. No. 2002-03-017, which exhibit is not set out herein, but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city secretary. 
c.  The monthly lake drainage basin component is determined by multiplying the fee shown on exhibit A, attached to Ord. No. 2002-03-017, which is not set out herein, by the SFLUE calculated for the property. 
(Code 1982, § 31-212; Ord. No. 2002-03-017, § 2, 3-5-2002; Ord. No. 2007-09-091, § 2, 9-18-2007; Ord. No. 2008-08-078, 8-19-2008; Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 5, 4-7-2015)  
Sec. 110-396. - Levy of fees. 
The drainage charges, SFLUE calculations, and resulting SDUS fees adopted by and through Ordinance No. 2015-04-030 amending Ord. No. 2002-03-017 shall be levied commencing with the May, 2015, utility billing cycle. 
(Code 1982, § 31-213; Ord. No. 2002-03-017, § 2, 3-5-2002; Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 5, 4-7-2015)  
Sec. 110-397. - Exemptions.

(Code 1982, § 31-214; Ord. No. 2002-03-017, § 2, 3-5-2002; Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 6, 4-7-2015)  
Sec. 110-398. - Billing, deposits and expenditures. 
(a)  The city will bill for drainage services on the monthly utility bill along with water, sewer and solid waste services, as may be applicable. In the event the property has no associated utility bill, the city may place the charge on an adjacent property under the same ownership, or may establish a separate utility account. If the occupant of the property is not also the owner of the property, the owner of the property shall be responsible to the city for payment of any SDUS fee due and owing on the property not paid by the occupant. 
(b)  There will be no separate deposit required for initial service. A deposit will be required following any discontinuance for delinquent payment. 
(c)  In the case of a delinquent payment of the monthly utility bill, which includes the drainage charge, pursuant to Texas Local Government Code § 552.050, the city manager is hereby authorized to discontinue service of all city utilities for nonpayment, even if the amount in dispute is the drainage charge component of the monthly utility bill. The city manager is also authorized to employ other remedies at law to recover any charge not paid when due. 
(d)  The income of the SDUS fee shall be segregated and completely identifiable in the city accounts. The moneys received from surface water drainage utility system charges shall be used only for purposes that are directly or indirectly related to the surface water drainage utility system. These uses may include, by way of example and not limitation, any of the following items that are necessary or incident to the provision and operation of draining the benefitted property: 
(1)  Study of entire watersheds, subwatersheds or individual projects; 
(2)  Design, engineering, construction and maintenance of watershed improvements in existing or potentially high or rapid growth areas including NRCS dams; 
(3)  Design, engineering, construction and maintenance of watershed improvements in areas where the costs of such improvements deprive an area of economic benefit; 
(4)  Study and resolution of erosion issues now existing, anticipated or appearing in the future; 
(5)  Design, engineering, construction and maintenance of watershed improvements in areas that will open up new drainage basins for development; 
(6)  Acquisition of staff, equipment, software and hardware, etc., necessary to implement the above; and 
(7)  Payment of any expenditure attributable to unfunded or partially funded state or federal mandates related to stormwater. 
(e)  Moneys received from the lake drainage basin component of the charge shall be used only for purposes that are directly related to the surface water drainage utility system of the applicable drainage basin. 
(f)  All billings, credits, exemptions and other procedures relating to these fees shall be subject to the provisions of the Municipal Drainage Utility Systems Act, Texas Local Government Code §§ 552.041, et seq., and other applicable law. 
(Code 1982, § 31-215; Ord. No. 2002-03-017, § 2, 3-5-2002; Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 7, 4-7-2015)  
DIVISION 3. - CREDITS 
 
Sec. 110-399. - Credit program. 
Nonresidential, commercial and/or industrial properties may apply for and the city may grant to such users credit against that portion of their respective SDUS fees attributable to the SFLUE based on their voluntary use of stormwater management techniques or best management practices ("BMPs") to offset the impacts of their property on stormwater runoff (the "stormwater credit program" or "program"). The BMP credit is applied as a percent discount to regular monthly surface water drainage utility system fees and will be administered pursuant to the city's stormwater credit program. The city's approved stormwater credit program manual is hereby adopted herein by reference for all purposes allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 8, 4-7-2015)  
Sec. 110-400. - Administration of BMP credit program. 
(a)  The stormwater administrator will be responsible for the overall administration of the program including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Accepting and reviewing applications; 
(2)  Approving applications; 
(3)  Certifying the total amount of the BMP credit; 
(4)  Amending the stormwater account records to reflect changes in the BMP credit; 
(5)  Receiving and reviewing annual self-inspection reports; and 
(6)  Requesting independent inspections as appropriate to ensure proper maintenance. 
(b)  Any property owner or city service customer aggrieved by a decision of the stormwater administrator regarding (1) a determination as to whether a certain parcel of property is exempt from the levy of a drainage charge or (2) the application of the BMP credit program to a certain parcel of property may appeal the determination of the stormwater administrator to the director of engineering. The property owner or city service customer shall file an appeal in writing with the director of engineering within ten days from the date of the decision being appealed. 
The written appeal filed by the property owner or city service customer shall identify the facts supporting (1) any claim that the property in question is exempt from the levy of a drainage charge or (2) any claim that the property in question is entitled to more BMP credits than approved by the stormwater administrator. If no resolution of the appeal can be reached with the director of engineering, the city council shall hear the appeal within 30 days from the date received by the director of engineering. The director of engineering shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including any applicable technical information submitted by the appellant. 
The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the property is exempt from the levy of a drainage charge or the amount of the BMP credit was not calculated according to the applicable schedule of BMP credits or the guidelines established for determining BMP credits. 
(Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 8, 4-7-2015)  
Sec. 110-401. - Application for BMP credit. 
All required attachments indicated in the forms or specified above must be included for the application to be considered complete. The stormwater administrator will, following review of the complete application, determine the appropriate amount of the BMP credit to which a property is entitled pursuant to the city's stormwater credit program and subject to this article. Such BMP credit will be valid for a period of time, as set forth in section 110-402, below, subject to continuing compliance of the BMP credit options on the property in question with the stormwater credit program. 
(Ord. No. 2015-04-030, § 8, 4-7-2015)  
Sec. 110-402. - Expiration of BMP credit, renewal application and annual reporting. 
(a)  BMPs with annual renewal. A BMP credit approved by the stormwater administrator pursuant to the city's stormwater credit program for one of the following BMPs shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of approval, at which time the right to receive the BMP credit will expire: 
(1)  Voluntary community cleanup program (onsite or downstream); and 
(2)  Parking lot sweeping. 
For the continuation of the foregoing BMP credits, a renewal application must be filed annually prior to the expiration of the then-current BMP credit year approved by the stormwater administrator. Annual self-reports and maintenance records together with any other documentation identified by the stormwater credit program will be required to be submitted with the renewal application annually prior to expiration to document program compliance for the preceding year. If the complete renewal application is not received by the city by the expiration date, the BMP credit will automatically expire and the full amount of the SDUS fees collected for the property will be charged. 
Timely filing of the complete renewal application with the city will stay the expiration of the BMP credit for the property in question until such time as the stormwater administrator reviews and approves, or disapproves, the renewal application. The stormwater administrator may increase, decrease, or terminate the amount of the BMP credit a particular property is eligible to receive pursuant to the city's stormwater credit program based upon the stormwater administrator's review and evaluation of the renewal application, the annual self-report, and any and all other information then available. Failure to provide any required information in support of the renewal application shall result in the denial of the BMP credit for the property. 
(b)  BMPs of continuous duration. A BMP credit approved by the stormwater administrator pursuant to the city's stormwater credit program for one of the following BMPs shall be valid from the date of approval and for so long as the BMPs are inspected, properly maintained, and remain compliant with the applicable program requirements: 
(1)  Single stage detention/retention facilities; 
(2)  Aeration fountain; 
(3)  Industrial facility compliance; 
(4)  Riparian preservation; 
(5)  Multi-stage detention;

Sec. 118-3. - Zones. 
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transition surfaces, horizontal surface and conical surface. Such areas are shown on the McKinney National Airport Zoning Map consisting of one sheet, prepared by Cook Consultants, Inc., Dallas, Texas and dated January 16, 1978, which is attached to the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and made a part hereof. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. Runway 17/35 approach zone is established beneath the approach surface at each end of runway 17/35 on McKinney National Airport for nonprecision instrument landings and takeoffs. The approach zone shall have a width of 500 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway, widening thereafter uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a horizontal distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway, its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zones. Transition zones are hereby established beneath the transition surface adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the zoning map. Transition surfaces, symmetrically located on either side of runways, have variable widths as shown on the zoning map. Transitional surfaces extend outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven to one from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surfaces. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. The area beneath a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
(4)  Conical zone. The area beneath the conical surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20 to one for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. 
(Code 1982, § 33-3; Ord. of 9-10-1979, § 3; Ord. No. 2003-09-081, § 1, 9-16-2003; Ord. No. 2013-11-107, § 2, 11-5-2013) 
Editor's note The airport zoning map is not printed herein, but is available for public inspection at the offices of the city.  
Sec. 118-4. - Height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone created by this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. Such height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Approach zones. Runway 17/35 one foot in height for each 34 feet in horizontal distance beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the elevation of the end of the runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
(2)  Transition zones. Runway 17/35 one foot in height for each seven feet in horizontal distance beginning at any point 250 feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of the runway extending 200 feet beyond each end thereof, extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation or a height of 732 feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits of one foot vertical height for each seven feet horizontal distance measured from the edge of the approach zone and extending upward and outward to the points where they intersect the horizontal surface. 
(3)  Horizontal zone. That area beneath the horizontal surface which is located 150 feet above the airport elevation, or a height of 732 feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone. That area beneath the conical surface which is one foot in height for each 20 feet of horizontal distance beginning at the periphery of the horizontal surface extending to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation, except that the conical surface shall be the same height as the precision instrument approach surface at those elevations where the conical surface intersects the precision instrument approach slope. 
(b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to 35 feet above the surface of the land. 
(c)  Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
(Code 1982, § 33-4; Ord. of 9-10-1979, § 4)  
Sec. 118-5. - Use restrictions. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be made of land within any zone established by this chapter in such a manner as to: 
(1)  Create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft; 
(2)  Make it difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others; 
(3)  Result in glare in the eyes of flyers using the airport; 
(4)  Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport; or 
(5)  Otherwise endanger the landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
(Code 1982, § 33-5; Ord. of 9-10-1979, § 5)  
Sec. 118-6. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derived, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport zoning board to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city.

Sec. 118-7. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. 
(1)  Permit required. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. 
a.  Exception. A permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land, contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone. 
b.  Indication of purpose. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
c.  Hazard marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the city, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
(2)  Savings clause. Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter except as set forth in section 118-4(a)(5). 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the airport zoning board determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.

a.  Submits a detailed plan and time schedule for the work at the hearing; and 
b.  Establishes at the hearing that the work cannot justifiably be completed within 90 days because of the scope and complexity of the work.

For water and wastewater facilities, a site-related facility shall include those lines which are less than or equal to 12 inches in diameter. Site-related facilities also include water and wastewater lines between two or more developers where pro-rata reimbursement agreements are required to equitably allocate costs. Site-related facility cost means either the cost of a site-related facility or that portion of the cost of a system facility equivalent to the first 12 inches in diameter of the size of a water or wastewater main, and which has not been included in the costs used to compute the maximum impact fee per service unit. 
System facility means a capital improvement or facility expansion which is designated in the impact fee capital improvements plan and which is not a site-related facility. System facility may include a capital improvement which is located off-site, within, or on and along the perimeter of the new development site. For water and wastewater facilities, a system facility shall include the oversized portion of those lines which are greater than 12 inches in diameter and which serve solely new development and which are on the impact fee capital improvements plan or the comprehensive water or wastewater improvements plan. 
Wastewater facility means an improvement for providing wastewater service, including but not limited to, land or easements, treatment facilities, lift stations, collector mains or interceptor mains. "Wastewater facility" excludes wastewater facilities, lines, or mains which are constructed by developers, the costs of which are reimbursed through pro-rata or other development-related agreements paid by subsequent users of the facilities. Wastewater facilities exclude site-related facilities. 
Wastewater facility expansion means the expansion of the capacity of any existing wastewater improvement for the purpose of serving new development, but does not include the repair, maintenance, modernization, or expansion of an existing wastewater facility to serve existing development. 
Wastewater improvements plan identifies the wastewater facilities or wastewater expansion and their associated costs that are necessitated by and which are attributable to new development, for a period not to exceed ten years, which capital improvements are to be financed in whole or in part through the imposition of wastewater impact fees pursuant to this article. The wastewater improvements plan is a part or component of the "Impact Fee Capital Improvements Plan or Capital Improvements Plans for Utility Impact Fees" ("Utility Improvements Plan") adopted by resolution of the city council, and attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 as Exhibit 2. 
Water facility means an improvement for providing water service, including, but not limited to, land or easements, water treatment facilities, water supply facilities, or water distribution lines.

The water improvements plan is a part or component of the "Impact Fee Capital Improvements Plan or Capital Improvements Plans for Utility Impact Fees" ("Utility Improvements Plan") adopted by resolution of the city council, and attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 as Exhibit 2. 
Water meter means a device for measuring the flow of water to a development, whether for domestic or for irrigation purposes. 
Water meter size ("meter size") combined with water meter type ("meter type") provide the expression of the magnitude of the water and wastewater demand created by each land use planned within a particular development based on the use of the ¾-inch water meter as the basic service unit. Other water meter sizes and types are compared to the ¾-inch water meter through a ratio of water flows. This same ratio is then used to determine the proportional impact fee amount for each meter size and meter type, where distinguished, as reflected on schedule 1 and schedule 2 attached to Ord. No. 2008-11-103 and incorporated herein by reference.

No application for new development shall be approved within the city without assessment of an impact fee pursuant to this article, and no building permit shall be issued unless the applicant has paid the impact fee imposed by and calculated hereinunder. 
(Code 1982, § 37-36; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.06), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.06), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.06), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 4, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-25. - Land use assumptions. 
(a)  The land use assumptions for utility impact fees for the city are attached to Ord. No. 2008-11-103 as exhibit 1 and are incorporated herein by reference. 
(b)  The land use assumptions for utility impact fees for the city shall be updated at least every five-years, utilizing the amendment procedure set forth in section 130-34. 
(c)  Amendments to the land use assumptions for utility impact fees shall incorporate projections of changes in land uses, densities, intensities and population therein over at least a ten-year period. 
(Code 1982, § 37-37; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.07), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.07), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.07), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 5, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-26. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum impact fee per service unit (pre-credit) and the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) for wastewater and water facilities shall be as set forth for each meter size and meter type where meter type is distinguished in: 
(1)  Schedule 1, table A, if the date of final plat recording is prior to September 1, 2003 and replatting is not necessary; 
(2)  Schedule 1, table B, if the date of final plat recording is on or after September 1, 2003 through and including November 9, 2008 and replatting is not necessary; 
(3)  Schedule 1, table C, if the date of final plat recording is on or after November 10, 2008 through and including November 19, 2013 and replatting is not necessary; 
(4)  Schedule 1, table D, if the date of final plat recording or replat recording is on or after November 20, 2013. 
Schedule 1, tables A through D (sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as "schedule 1") are attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 and made a part of this article by reference. Schedule 1 may be amended from time to time by ordinance. 
(b)  The maximum impact fee per service unit (post-credit) set forth in schedule 1 that is assessed to new development, as may be amended from time to time, is declared to be the roughly proportionate measure of the impact(s) generated by a new unit of development on the city's utility system. To the extent that the impact fee per service unit collected is less than the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit, such difference is hereby declared to be founded on policies unrelated to the measurement of the actual impacts of the development on the city's transportation system. The maximum assessable impact fee per service unit may be used in evaluating any claim by an applicant, developer, or property owner that the dedication, construction, or contribution of a capital improvement imposed as a condition of development approval pursuant to the city's regulations is not roughly proportionate to the impact(s) of the new development on the city's utility system. 
(Code 1982, § 37-38; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.08), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.08), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.08), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 6, 11-4-2008; Ord. No. 2013-11-109, § 5, 11-19-2013)  
Sec. 130-27. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  Assessment of the impact fee per service unit for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For a new development for which a final plat was recorded prior to September 1, 2003 and for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations prior to development or for a new development for which no plat is necessary pursuant to the city's zoning ordinance because the property in question is a lot of record, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit, and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) as set forth in schedule 1, table A, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 and incorporated herein by reference, for each meter size for each proposed development unit as set forth in schedule 1, table A. 
(2)  For a new development for which recordation of the final plat occurred on or after September 1, 2003 through and including November 9, 2008 and for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time of final plat recordation and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable (post-credit) impact fee per service unit (post-credit) as set forth in schedule 1, table B, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 and incorporated herein by reference, for each meter size for each proposed development unit as set forth in schedule 1, table B. 
(3)  For a new development for which recordation of the final plat occurred on or after November 10, 2008 through and including November 19, 2013, and for which no replatting is necessary, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time of final plat recordation and shall not exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) as set forth in schedule 1, table C, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 and incorporated herein by reference, for each meter size and meter type for each proposed development unit as set forth in schedule 1, table C. 
(4)  For a new development for which recordation of the final plat occurred on or after November 20, 2013, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time of final plat recordation and shall not exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) as set forth in schedule 1, table D, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 and incorporated herein by reference, for each meter size and meter type for each proposed development unit as set forth in schedule 1, table D. 
(5)  For land on which new development occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit, and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) as set forth in schedule 1, table D, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-109 and incorporated herein by reference, for each meter size and meter type for each proposed development unit as set forth in schedule 1, table D. 
(b)  Following assessment of the impact fee pursuant to subsection (A), the amount of the impact fee assessed per service unit for that development cannot be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new application for final plat approval or replat approval or proposes to increase the meter size or meter type for any use within that development, in which case new assessment shall occur at the maximum assessable schedule 1 rate then in effect. 
(c)  In the event that a development is evaluated by city staff, which results in a decrease in the number of service units, the city will credit the overall development, based on the reduction in the number of service units. 
(d)  Following the vacating of any plat or submittal of any replat, a new assessment must be made in accordance with section 130-26. 
(e)  Approval of an amended plat pursuant to Texas Local Government Code § 212.016, and the subdivision ordinance, section 142-79, is not subject to reassessment for an impact fee provided that the use of the property remains the same and no increase in the meter size or meter type for any use within that development is sought. 
(Code 1982, § 37-39; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.09), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.09), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.09), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 7, 11-4-2008; Ord. No. 2013-11-109, § 6, 11-19-2013)  
Sec. 130-28. - Payment and collection of impact fees. 
(a)  For all new developments, impact fees shall be collected at the time of application for and in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit or at the time of application for utility connection, whichever event occurs first. The impact fees to be paid and collected for each meter size and meter type are listed in schedule 2. 
(b)  The city reserves the right to enter into an agreement with a developer for a different time and manner of payment of impact fees, in which case the agreement shall determine the time and manner of payment. 
(c)  The city shall compute the impact fees for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  Determine the number of each meter size and meter type in the new development and multiply by the corresponding proportionate amount of impact fees for each such meter size and meter type contained in schedule 2 then in effect. 
(2)  The amount of each impact fee shall be reduced by any allowable offsets for that category of capital improvements, in the manner provided in section 130-29. 
(3)  The total amount of the impact fees for the new development shall be calculated and attached to the development application or request for connection as a condition of approval. 
(d)  The amount of each impact fee (wastewater and water) for a new development shall not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the maximum assessable fee per service unit for each category of utility pursuant to section 130-26 by the number of service units generated by the development. According to the American Water Works Association the ratio of water flows for different sizes and types of water meters is as follows: 
Meter Size 	Meter Type 	Ratio to ¾" meter 
¾" 	Multi-jet (simple) 	1.0 
1" 	Multi-jet (simple) 	1.7 
2" 	Ultrasonic 	8.3 
3" 	Ultrasonic 	16.7 
4" 	Ultrasonic 	33.3 
6" 	Ultrasonic 	53.3 
8" 	Ultrasonic 	93.3 
10" to 12" 	Ultrasonic 	183.3 
 
Accordingly, the number of service units for each meter size and meter type follows the same ratio and is used to determine the proportional water and wastewater impact fee for each meter size and meter type compared to a simple ¾-inch water meter. 
(e)  If the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the impact fees shall be computed using the schedule 2 then in effect, with credits for previous payment of fees being applied against the new fees due. 
(f)  For a new development which is unplatted at the time of application for a building permit or utility connection, or for a new development that received final plat approval prior to or on June 20, 1987, for water and wastewater facilities, and for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations prior to development, collection of impact fees shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit or utility connection whichever occurs first, and shall be the amount of the impact fee per service unit, as set forth in schedule 2 then in effect. 
(g)  Whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a development or increase the meter size or meter type for any use within that development, the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using schedule 2 then in effect, and such additional fee shall be collected at the times prescribed by this section. 
(h)  For a single family residential lot of record existing on June 20, 1987, for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations prior to development, or for a development which was assessed between June 20, 1987 and May 15, 1990, and for which no increase in the meter size or meter type is sought, collection of impact fees shall be pursuant to schedule 2, and such fees shall be collected at the times prescribed by this section. 
(Code 1982, § 37-40; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.10), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.10), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.10), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 8, 11-4-2008; Ord. No. 2013-11-109, § 7, 11-19-2013; Ord. No. 2017-02-021, § 4, 2-7-2017)  
Sec. 130-29. - Offsets and credits against impact fees. 
(a)  The city shall offset the reasonable value of any system facility which is on the impact fee capital improvements plan and which has been dedicated to and has been accepted by the city on or after January 1, 1983, or credit the amount of any monetary contribution to such facility, against the amount of the impact fee for that category of capital improvement. 
(b)  All offsets and credits against impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and additional standards promulgated by the city council, which may be adopted as city council-approved administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset or credit shall be given for the dedication of land or easements for or the construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  No offset or credit shall exceed the documented and city approved costs to the developer of the system facility which was dedicated to and accepted by the city, or the amount of the monetary contribution actually made. 
(3)  The costs used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the capital improvements included in the capital improvements plan for utility impact fees for the category of facilities within the service area for which the impact fee is imposed. 
(4)  Offsets or credits given for system facilities for a development which has received final plat approval prior to the effective date of this amendatory ordinance shall be discounted taking into consideration the number of existing service units within such development. 
(5)  An offset or credit created pursuant to prior impact fee ordinances for which a specific termination date was not established shall expire no later than ten years after the date the ordinance under which such offset or credit was created was amended, repealed or replaced. Offsets or credits created pursuant to this article shall expire within ten years from the date the offset or credit was created. 
(6)  In no event will the city reimburse the property owner or developer for an offset or credit when no impact fees for the new development can be collected pursuant to this chapter or for any amount exceeding the total impact fees due for the development for that category of capital improvement, unless otherwise agreed to by the city. 
(7)  No offset shall be given for a site-related or system facility or any facility which is not identified within the applicable impact fees capital improvements plan, unless the city agrees that such improvement supplies capacity to new developments other than the development paying the impact fee and provisions for offsets are incorporated in an agreement for capital improvements pursuant to section 130-36 and an amendment is adopted adding such improvement to the impact fees capital improvements plan. 
(8)  A provision stating that in those instances where the city determines the projected cost to construct a system facility is not roughly proportionate to the dollar value of the impact fee credits which may be awarded for that system facility the city may consider, upon request of the developer, awarding impact fee credits based on the lesser of a percentage of the city's projected costs for that system facility or a percentage of the documented and city-approved costs to the developer of the system facility which was dedicated to and accepted by the city with the city's projected costs or the documented and city-approved costs to the developer being reduced by the same percentage of reduction as applied to the maximum impact fee per service unit (pre-credit) to arrive at the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) as reflected in the applicable table of Schedule 1. 
(c)  An applicant for new development must apply for an offset or credit against impact fees due for the development either at the time of application for final plat approval or at the time of connection(s) to the utility system, unless the city otherwise agrees. The applicant shall file a petition for offsets or credits with the city on a form provided for such purpose. The contents of the petition shall be established by council-approved administrative guidelines. The city must provide the applicant, in writing, with a decision on the offset or credit request, including the reasons for the decision within ninety (90) days. 
(d)  The available offset or credit associated with the plat shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  For single family residential lots in a new development consisting only of single-family residential lots which have received final plat approval, such offset or credit shall be applied at the time of issuance of the building permit or connection to the city's utility system by the first lot and thereafter for each subsequent lot within the final plat at the time of plat recordation in the order in which building permits or utility connections are issued for such lots until the offset or credit has been exhausted, unless stipulated otherwise in a binding facilities agreement or a binding impact fee credit agreement. 
(2)  For all other types of new development, including those involving mixed uses, which have received final plat approval, the offset or credit applicable to the plat shall be applied to the impact fee due at the time of issuance of the first building permit or connection to which the offset or credit is applicable, and thereafter to all subsequently issued building permits or connections, until the offset or credit has been exhausted, unless stipulated otherwise in a binding facilities agreement or a binding impact fee credit agreement. 
(3)  At its sole discretion, the city may authorize alternative credit or offset agreements upon petition by the owner in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the city council.

Sec. 130-30. - Establishment of accounts. 
(a)  The city's finance department shall establish an account to which interest is allocated for each category of capital facility in each service area for which an impact fee is imposed pursuant to this chapter. Each impact fee collected within the service area shall be deposited in such account. 
(b)  Interest earned on the account into which the impact fees are deposited shall be considered funds of the account and shall be used solely for the purposes authorized in section 130-31. 
(c)  The city's finance department shall establish adequate financial and accounting controls to ensure that impact fees disbursed from the account are utilized solely for the purposes authorized in section 130-31. Disbursement of funds shall be authorized by the city at such times as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that any fee paid shall be expended within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ten years from the date the fee is deposited into the account. 
(d)  The city's finance department shall maintain and keep financial records for impact fees, which shall show the source and disbursement of all fees collected in or expended from each service area. The records of the account into which impact fees are deposited shall be open for public inspection and copying during ordinary business hours. The city may establish a fee for copying services. 
(e)  The finance department shall maintain and keep adequate financial records for said account which shall show the source and disbursement of all funds placed in or expended by such account. 
(f)  Any credits, offsets, or rights to reimbursement hereunder, including facility agreements under section 130-36(a) and (b) shall terminate or be payable, as the case may require, on September 30 of the final year of any right to such offset, credit, or reimbursement. 
(g)  Any payments to a developer required hereunder accruing in any year shall be due on or before sixty (60) days after the end of the fiscal year, September 30. 
(Code 1982, § 37-42; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.12), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.12), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.12), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 10, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-31. - Use of proceeds of impact fee accounts. 
(a)  The impact fees collected for each service area pursuant to this chapter may be used to finance or to recoup the costs of any capital improvements or facilities expansions identified in the applicable capital improvements plan for utility impact fees for the service area, including the construction contract price, surveying and engineering fees, land acquisition costs (including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorney's fees, and expert witness fees), and the fees actually paid or contracted to be paid to an independent qualified engineer or financial consultant preparing or updating the capital improvements plan for utility impact fees who is not an employee of the political subdivision. Impact fees may also be used to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance such capital improvements or facilities expansions. 
(b)  Impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall not be used to pay for any of the following expenses: 
(1)  Construction, acquisition or expansion of capital improvements or assets other than those identified in the applicable capital improvements plan for utility impact fees; 
(2)  Repair, operation, or maintenance of existing or new capital improvements or facilities expansions; 
(3)  Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards; 
(4)  Upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements to provide better service to existing development; provided, however, that impact fees may be used to pay the costs of upgrading, expanding or replacing existing capital improvements in order to meet the need for new capital improvements generated by new development; 
(5)  Administrative and operating costs of the city. 
(Code 1982, § 37-43; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.13), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.13), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.13), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 11, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-32. - Appeals. 
(a)  The property owner or applicant for development may appeal the follow administrative decisions to the city council: 
(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the development; 
(2)  The amount of the impact fee due; 
(3)  The availability of, the amount of, or the expiration of an offset or a credit; 
(4)  The application of an offset or credit against an impact fee due; 
(5)  The amount of the impact fee in proportion to the benefit received by new development; or 
(6)  Amount of a refund due, if any. 
(b)  The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the amount of the fee or the amount of the offset or credit was not calculated according to the applicable schedule of impact fees or the guidelines established for determining offsets and credits. 
(c)  The appellant must file a notice of appeal with the city secretary within 30 days following the decision. If the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application may be processed while the appeal is pending. 
(Code 1982, § 37-44; Ord. No. 1868, § 1(1.14), 5-15-1990; Ord. No. 96-03-13, § 1(1.14), 3-19-1996; Ord. No. 2001-08-092, § 1(1.14), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-056, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 12, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-33. - Refunds. 
(a)  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this chapter which has not been expended within the service area within ten years from the date of payment, shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner the property at the time the refund is paid or, if the impact fee, was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in Article 1.03, Title 79, Revised Statues (Article 5069-1.03, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), or any successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this section shall be submitted in writing within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period for expenditure of the fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-in, first-out basis. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this chapter shall be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements or facilities expansion authorized in section 130-31 within the service area within ten years following the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected for such improvements expansions during such period. 
(c)  Upon application, any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to these regulations shall be refunded if: 
(1)  Existing service is available and service is denied; or 
(2)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and the city has failed to commence construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or 
(3)  Service was not available when the fee was collected and has not subsequently been made available within a reasonable period of time considering the type of capital improvement or facility expansion to be constructed, but in any event later than five (5) years from the date of fee payment. 
(d)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), the city shall prorate the same by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(e)  If the building permit for a new development for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, and a modified or new application has not been filed within six months of such expiration, the city shall, upon written application, refund the amount of the impact fee to the applicant. The city may establish guidelines for refunding of impact fees collected for which construction plans have been abandoned.

Sec. 130-106. - Definitions. 
Assessment means the determination of the amount of the maximum impact fee per service unit which can be imposed on new development pursuant to this article. The amount of the impact fee per service unit is a measure of the traffic impact on system facilities created by the new development. 
Capital improvement means a roadway facility with a life expectancy of three or more years, to be owned and operated by or on behalf of the city (including the city's share of costs for roadways and associated improvements designated as a numbered highway on the official federal or state highway system). "Capital improvement" applies to a newly constructed roadway facility or to the expansion of an existing roadway facility necessary to serve new development. 
City means the City of McKinney, Texas. 
Credit means: 
(1)  When used in the context of determining the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit, an amount equal to: 
a.  That portion of ad valorem tax and utility service revenues generated by new service units during the program period that is used for the payment of improvements, including the payment of debt, that are included in the capital improvements plan; or 
b.  In the alternative, a credit equal to 50 percent of the total projected cost of implementing the capital improvements plan; or 
(2)  When used in the context of determining the offset for system facilities, the amount of the reduction of an impact fee designed to fairly reflect the value of any construction of, contributions to, or dedications of a system facility agreed to or required by the city as a condition of development approval, pursuant to rules herein established or pursuant to city council-approved administrative guidelines which value shall be credited on a vehicle mile basis against roadway facilities impact fees otherwise due from the development and which credits are hereinafter referred to as an "offset" or "offsets" to avoid confusion. 
Development unit or development units is the expression of the magnitude of the transportation demand created by each land use planned within a particular development and is used to compute the number of service units consumed by each individual land use application. 
Final plat approval or approval of a final plat means the point at which the applicant has complied with all conditions of approval and the plat (minor plat or record plat) has been released for filing with the county. 
Final plat recordation or recordation of a final plat means the point at which the applicant has complied with all conditions precedent to recording an approved final plat (minor plat or record plat) in the county, including the final completion of and acceptance by the city of any infrastructure or other improvements required by the subdivision ordinance or any other ordinance and the plat is filed for record with the county clerk's office. 
Impact fee or roadway impact fee means a charge or assessment imposed by the city, pursuant to this article, against new development in order to generate revenue for funding or recouping the costs of capital improvements or facility expansions necessitated by and attributable to the new development. "Impact fees" or "roadway impact fees" do not include road escrow payments for site-related facilities imposed under facility agreements in existence on the effective date of this article. The term also does not include dedication of rights-of-way or easements or construction or dedication of drainage facilities, streets, sidewalks, or curbs if the dedication or construction is required by the subdivision ordinance and is necessitated by and attributable to the new development. 
Land use assumptions means and includes a description of the service areas and the projections of population and employment growth and associated changes in land uses, densities and intensities adopted by the city, as may be amended from time to time, in each service area over a ten-year period upon which the roadway improvements plan is based. The land use assumptions are set out in the most recently updated land use assumptions for roadway impact fees adopted by resolution of the city council, and attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 as Exhibit 1. 
Land use vehicle-mile equivalency tables or LUVMET are tables that provide the standardized measure of consumption or use of roadway facilities attributable to a new development based on the land use category of the development and historical data and trends applicable to the city during the previous ten years. The LUVMET recognizes and expresses the magnitude of the transportation demand created by different land use categories within a particular development and allow different uses of land to more accurately bear the cost and expense of the impacts generated by such uses. The LUVMET expresses the number of service units consumed by each individual land use application as "vehicle miles (per development unit)." 
New development means a project involving the subdivision of land and/or the construction, reconstruction, redevelopment, conversion, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any structure, or any use or extension of the use of land which has the effect of increasing the requirements for capital improvements, measured by an increase in the number of service units to be generated by such activity, and which requires either the approval and filing with the county of a plat pursuant to the city's subdivision ordinance or the issuance of a building permit. 
Offset or offsets means the amount of the reduction of an impact fee designed to fairly reflect the value of any construction of, contributions to, or dedications of a system facility agreed to or required by the city as a condition of development approval, pursuant to rules herein established or pursuant to city council-approved administrative guidelines which value shall be credited on a vehicle mile basis against roadway facilities impact fees otherwise due from the development. 
Recoup means to reimburse the city for capital improvements which the city has previously installed or caused to be installed. 
Roadway means any freeway, expressway or arterial or collector streets or roads designated in the city's adopted master thoroughfare plan, as may be amended from time to time. The term includes the city's share of costs for roadways designated as a numbered highway on the official federal or state highway system. 
Roadway facility means an improvement or appurtenance to a roadway which includes, but is not limited to, rights-of-way, whether conveyed by deed or easement; intersection improvements; traffic signals; turn lanes; drainage facilities associated with the roadway; street lighting or curbs. "Roadway facility" also includes any improvement or appurtenance to an intersection with a roadway officially enumerated in the federal or state highway system. "Roadway facility" includes the city's share of costs for roadways and associated improvements designated as a numbered highway on the official federal or state highway system, including local matching funds and costs related to utility line relocation and the establishment of curbs, gutters, drainage appurtenances, and rights-of-way. "Roadway facility" excludes those improvements or appurtenances to a roadway which are site-related facilities. 
Roadway improvements plan or capital improvements plan for roadway impact fees identifies the capital improvements or facility expansions and associated costs for each roadway service area that are necessitated by and which are attributable to new development within the service area, for a period not to exceed ten years, which capital improvements are to be financed in whole or in part through the imposition of roadway impact fees pursuant to this article. The roadway improvements plan or capital improvements plan for roadway impact fees land use assumptions is set out in the most recently updated roadway impact fee update ("roadway improvements plan") adopted by resolution of the city council, and attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 as exhibit 2." 
Roadway service area or roadway benefits area means the geographic area(s) within the city's corporate limits, which do not exceed six miles and within which geographic area(s) roadway impact fees for capital improvements will be collected for new development occurring within such area, and within which fees so collected will be expended for those capital improvements identified in the roadway improvements plan to be located within the roadway service area. "Roadway service area" does not include any land outside the city limits. 
Service unit means one vehicle mile of travel in the afternoon peak hour of traffic and is also referred to as a "vehicle mile." 
Service unit equivalent means the amount of capacity created by contribution of a capital improvement on behalf of a new development, expressed in vehicle miles. 
Single family residential lot means a lot platted to accommodate a single family or a duplex dwelling unit, as authorized under the city's zoning regulations. 
Site-related facility means an improvement or facility which is constructed for the primary use or benefit of a new development and/or which is for the primary purpose of safe and adequate provision of roadway facilities to serve the new development and which is not included in the roadway improvements plan and for which the developer or property owner is solely responsible under the subdivision, and/or other applicable, regulations. 
System facility means a capital improvement which is designated in the roadway improvements plan and which is not a site-related facility. A system facility may include a capital improvement which is located off-site, within, or on and along the perimeter of the new development site.

Sec. 130-108. - Impact fees per service unit. 
(a)  The maximum impact fee per service unit (pre-credit) and the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) for each roadway service area shall be as set forth in: 
(1)  Schedule 1, table A, if the date of final plat recording is prior to September 1, 2003 and replatting is not necessary; 
(2)  Schedule 1, table B, if the date of final plat recording is on or after September 1, 2003 through and including November 9, 2008 and replatting is not necessary; 
(3)  Schedule 1, table C, if the date of final plat recording is on or after November 10, 2008 through and including November 19, 2013 and replatting is not necessary. 
(4)  Schedule 1, table D, if the date of final plat recording or replat recording is on or after November 20, 2013. 
Schedule 1, tables A through D (sometimes hereinafter referred to collectively as "schedule 1") are attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 and hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. 
(b)  The number of vehicle miles attributable to each land use category per development unit in each new development within a roadway service area shall be as set forth in: 
(1)  Schedule 1, table A, as designated for each particular roadway service area, roadway service areas 1 through 27 if the date of final plat recording is prior to September 1, 2003 and replatting is not necessary; 
(2)  Schedule 1, table B as designated for each particular roadway service area, roadway service areas A through M, if the date of final plat recording is on or after September 1, 2003 through and including November 9, 2008 and replatting is not necessary; 
(3)  Schedule 1, table C as designated for each particular roadway service area, roadway service areas A through M, if the date of final plat recording is on or after November 10, 2008 through and including November 19, 2013 and replatting is not necessary. 
(4)  Schedule 1, Table D as designated for each roadway service area, roadway service areas A through M, if the date of final plat recording or replat recording is on or after November 20, 2013.

(c)  Impact fee Schedule 1, and/or its various tables, may be amended from time to time by ordinance. 
(d)  The maximum assessable impact fee per service unit (post-credit) set forth in Schedule 1 that is assessed to new development, as may be amended from time to time, is declared to be the roughly proportionate measure of the impact(s) generated by a new unit of development on the city's transportation system. To the extent that the impact fee per service unit collected is less than the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit, such difference is hereby declared to be founded on policies unrelated to the measurement of the actual impacts of the development on the city's transportation system. The maximum assessable impact fee per service unit may be used in evaluating any claim by an applicant, developer, or property owner that the dedication, construction, or contribution of a capital improvement imposed as a condition of development approval pursuant to the city's regulations is not roughly proportionate to the impact(s) of the new development on the city's transportation system.

Sec. 130-109. - Assessment of impact fees. 
(a)  Assessment of the impact fee per service unit for any new development shall be made as follows: 
(1)  For a new development for which a final plat was recorded prior to September 1, 2003 and for which no replatting is necessary pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations prior to development or for a new development for which no plat is necessary pursuant to the city's zoning ordinance because the property in question is a lot of record, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit, and shall be the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit as set forth in schedule 1, table A, for the particular roadway service area in which the development is situated as reflected in map A, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 and incorporated herein by reference, multiplied by the number of vehicle miles (per development unit) for each proposed development unit in each proposed land use category as set forth in schedule 1, table A. 
(2)  For a new development for which recordation of the final plat occurred on or after September 1, 2003 through and including November 9, 2008 and for which no replatting is necessary, assessment of impact fees shall be at the time of final plat recordation and shall not exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit as set forth in Schedule 1, Table B for the particular roadway service area in which the development is situated as reflected in map B, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 and incorporated herein by reference, multiplied by the number of vehicle miles (per development unit) for each proposed development unit in each proposed land use category as set forth in schedule 1, table B. 
(3)  For a new development for which recordation of the final plat occurred on or after November 10, 2008 through and including November 19, 2013 and for which no replatting is necessary, assessment of impact fees shall be at the time of final plat recordation and shall not exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit as set forth in schedule 1, table C for the particular roadway service area in which the development is situated as reflected in map C, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 and incorporated herein by reference, multiplied by the number of vehicle miles (per development unit) for each proposed development unit in each proposed land use category as set forth in schedule 1, table C. 
(4)  For a new development for which recordation of the final plat occurred on or after November 20, 2013, assessment of impact fees shall be at the time of final plat recordation and shall not exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit as set forth in schedule 1, table D for the particular roadway service area in which the development is situated as reflected in map D, attached to Ord. No. 2013-11-108 and incorporated herein by reference, multiplied by the number of vehicle miles (per development unit) for each proposed development unit in each proposed land use category as set forth in schedule 1, table D. 
(5)  For land on which new development occurs or is proposed to occur without platting, assessment of impact fees shall occur at the time application is made for the building permit, and shall not exceed the amount of the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit as set forth in schedule 1, table D for the particular roadway service area in which the development is situated as reflected in map D multiplied by the number of vehicle miles (per development unit) for each proposed development unit in each proposed land use category as set forth in schedule 1, table D. 
(b)  Following assessment of the impact fee pursuant to subsection (A), the amount of the impact fee assessed per service unit for that new development cannot be increased, unless the owner proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new application for final plat approval or replat approval, in which case new assessment shall occur at the maximum assessable Schedule 1 rate then in effect. 
(c)  Following the vacating of any plat or submittal of any replat, a new assessment must be made in accordance with section 130-109(a)(4). 
(d)  Approval of an amending plat pursuant to Texas Local Government Code § 212.016 and the Subdivision Ordinance section 142-79 is not subject to reassessment of an Impact Fee hereunder provided that the use of the property remains the same. 
(Code 1982, § 37-87; Ord. No. 2000-03-20, § 1, 3-7-2000; Ord. No. 2001-08-091, § 1(3.07), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-055, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2003-07-062, § 1, 7-15-2003; Ord. No. 2005-11-116, § 1, 11-1-2005; Ord. No. 2008-11-102, § 4, 11-4-08; Ord. No. 2013-11-108, § 5, 11-19-2013)  
Sec. 130-110. - Payment and collection of impact fees. 
(a)  For all new developments, impact fees shall be collected at the time of application for and in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit. The impact fees to be paid and collected are listed in schedule 1. The city reserves the right to enter into an agreement with a developer for a different time and manner of payment of impact fees in which case the agreement shall determine the time and manner of payment. 
(b)  The city shall compute the impact fees to be paid and collected for the new development in the following manner: 
(1)  Determine the number of development units for each land use category in the new development using schedule 1 then in effect pursuant to section 130-109. 
(2)  Multiply the number of development units for each land use category in the new development by the vehicle miles (per development unit) for each such land use category also found in schedule 1 then in effect pursuant to section 130-109 to determine the number of service units attributable to the new development. 
(3)  If an offset agreement providing for offsets and credits against impact fees exists, the number of service units attributable to the new development shall be reduced by subtracting available service unit equivalents as provided in section 130-111. If adequate service unit equivalents for offsets and credits are available in an amount equal to or greater than the number of service units generated (required) by this new development, no fee is paid, but the pool of available service unit equivalents shall be reduced accordingly. 
(4)  The amount of impact fees to be collected shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units for the new development by the impact fee per service unit for the applicable roadway service area using schedule 1 and shall be calculated at the time of application for and in conjunction with the issuance of a building permit. 
(e)  If the building permit for which an impact fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the impact fees shall be computed using the LUVMET and schedule 1 then in effect with credits for previous payment of fees being applied against any new fees due. 
(f)  Whenever the property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for a development, the additional impact fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using the LUVMET and schedule 1 then in effect, and such additional fees shall be collected at the times prescribed by this section. 
(Code 1982, § 37-88; Ord. No. 2000-03-20, § 1, 3-7-2000; Ord. No. 2001-08-091, § 1(3.08), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-055, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2003-07-062, § 1, 7-15-2003; Ord. No. 2005-11-116, § 1, 11-1-2005; Ord. No. 2008-11-103, § 5, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-111. - Offsets and credits against impact fees. 
(a)  The city shall offset the reasonable value of any system facility which has been dedicated to and has been accepted by the city on or after May 18, 1982, or offset the amount of any monetary contributions to such facility, against the amount of the roadway impact fees due, in accordance with the rules set forth in this section. The value of an offset may be stated in dollars or service units. 
(b)  This subsection applies only to an offset associated with a capital improvement on the roadway improvement plan contributed to the city after the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997). Offsets associated with a system facility contributed to the city prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997) are addressed in subsection (c). 
(1)  For purposes of this subsection (b), an offset associated with a capital improvement on the roadway improvement plan contributed to the city after the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997) is created at the time that the city accepts the system facility for dedication or as may be otherwise stipulated in a binding facilities agreement for the facility pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations. 
(2)  At the time the offset is created, if no offset agreement exists, the developer shall apply for an offset agreement, and the agreement thereafter shall be enforced in accordance with the following terms, providing: 
a.  Identification of the plat with which the offset is to be associated; 
b.  The amount of the capacity created by the system facility, expressed in service unit equivalents; 
c.  A provision stating that the offset may be used to reduce impact fees imposed on new developments contained within the land subject to the associated plat after the effective date of the agreement; and 
d.  A provision that the amount of the offset shall be determined by estimating the number of service unit equivalents of capacity supplied by the system facility, reduced by: 
1.  The number of service units developed within the plat since the contribution of the system facility, using the LUVMET; 
2.  The amount of the city's participation in the excess costs of the system facility (expressed in service unit equivalents); and 
3.  The amount of any payments received from other new developments utilizing the system facility (expressed in service unit equivalents); and 
e.  A provision for reimbursement of any unused offsets consistent with subsection (b)(4) of this section 130-111. 
f.  A provision stating that the city may elect to buy back outstanding offsets in accordance with subsection 130-111(f). 
g.  A provision stating that in those instances where the city determines the unique characteristics of a roadway segment (such as drainage, topography, easements required, absence of roadway segments remaining in service area) and the projected cost to construct a section of roadway is not roughly proportionate to the dollar value of the vehicle mile credits which may be awarded for that roadway section, the city may consider, upon request of the developer, awarding impact fee credits based upon the developer's verified, actual costs of said roadway section. 
The developer may assign the offset agreement with the city's consent, but in no event shall the offsets provided for in the agreement be transferred to any development not subject to the plat associated with such offsets. 
(3)  The developer may petition the city council for offsets for contribution of a capital improvement, including road right-of-way, which is not identified in the roadway improvements plan, if the improvement will supply capacity to new developments other than to the development seeking the offset, at the time the facility is accepted by the city or a binding facilities agreement for the facility is executed pursuant to the city's subdivision regulations. In no event, however, may offsets attributable to such facility be used to reduce impact fees until the roadway improvements plan has been amended to include the capital improvement for which the offset was granted. If the petition is granted, the terms shall be incorporated into an offset agreement as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof. The agreement shall also provide that the amount of the offset shall not exceed the capacity of the capital improvement that is included in the roadway improvements plan. 
(4)  As provided in the offset agreement required by subsection (b)(2), hereof, the developer may apply for reimbursement of excess offsets following either completion of all development subject to the plat with which the offsets are associated or after ten years following execution of the offset agreement. The following rules apply to such reimbursement, and shall be incorporated into the offset agreement. 
a.  The developer must apply for reimbursement within six months following either: 
1.  Completion of all development subject to the plat with which the offsets are associated; or 
2.  Ten years after the date of execution of the offset agreement. 
b.  The following terms shall be incorporated into the reimbursement agreement and the agreement shall be enforced in accordance with such terms: 
1.  A provision stating that the amount to be reimbursed shall be equal to the number of unused offsets (expressed as a number of service units) multiplied by a fraction equal to the impact fee per service unit to be collected, as set forth in schedule 1 in effect on the date of execution of the offset agreement, divided by the maximum assessable impact fee per service unit, as set forth in schedule 1 in effect on the date of execution of the offset agreement; 
2.  A provision stating that the amount to be reimbursed may be further equitably reduced, if fewer than 50 percent of the number of service units in the plat with which the system facility giving rise to the offset have been developed on the date of application for reimbursement; 
3.  A provision stating that repayment shall be made within five years from the date of execution of the reimbursement agreement, from roadway impact fees collected within the same roadway service area in which the property in question is located, subject to the availability of such funds; 
4.  A provision that termination or reduction of the city's authority under state law to impose impact fees for roadway facilities shall terminate or correspondingly reduce any obligation of the city to make payments under the offset agreement; and 
5.  A provision stating that, in converting the offsets from service unit equivalents to a dollar value, the number of service unit equivalents shall be multiplied by the value of a service unit expressed in dollars using schedule 1 in effect at the time the offset agreement was executed. 
c.  Execution of a reimbursement agreement shall automatically terminate any offsets associated with a plat pursuant to an offset agreement. Thereafter, new development within the area subject to the plat shall pay roadway impact fees in accordance with schedule 1 then in effect. 
(c)  This subsection applies only to offsets associated with a system facility contributed to the city after May 18, 1982, but prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997) for which no development agreement exists providing for dedication or construction of system facilities and for offsets against impact fees in proportion thereto. Any person who dedicated a system facility to the city or financed such system facility prior to the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997), or any person who is subject to an impact fee for a new development in a plat associated with the system facility, may create offsets for such system facility by entering into an offset agreement within two years of the effective date of Ordinance No. 2000-03-20 (March 7, 2000). The agreement shall be enforced in accordance with the following terms, providing: 
(1)  Identification of the plat with which the offset is to be associated; 
(2)  The amount of the capacity created by the capital improvement, expressed in service units equivalents; 
(3)  A provision stating that the offset may be used to reduce impact fees imposed on new developments contained within the land subject to the associated plat after the effective date of the agreement; 
(4)  A provision stating that the amount of the offset shall be determined by estimating the number of service units of capacity supplied by the system facility, reduced by: 
a.  The number of service units developed within the plat since the contribution of the system facility, using the LUVMET; 
b.  The amount of the city's participation in the excess costs of the system facility (expressed in service unit equivalents); and 
c.  The amount of any payments received from other new developments utilizing the system facility (expressed in service unit equivalents); 
(5)  A provision stating that offsets created pursuant to the offset agreement shall expire at the time that development subject to the associated plat is completed; and 
(6)  A provision stating that once the offset has expired, no reimbursement for unused offsets shall be due. 
(7)  A provision stating that, in converting offsets from service unit equivalents to a dollar value, the number of service unit equivalents shall be multiplied by the value of a service unit expressed in dollars using schedule 1 in effect at the time the offset agreement was executed. 
(8)  A provision stating that the city may elect to buy back outstanding offsets in accordance with subsection 130-111(f). 
The developer may assign the offset agreement with the city's consent, but in no event shall the offsets provided for in the agreement be transferred to any development not subject to the plat associated with such offsets. 
(d)  All offsets against roadway impact fees shall be subject to the following limitations and shall be granted based on this article and additional standards promulgated by the city council, which may be adopted as city council-approved administrative guidelines. 
(1)  No offset shall be given for the dedication of land or easements for or the construction of site-related facilities. 
(2)  No offset shall exceed the documented and city-approved costs to the developer of the system facility which was dedicated to and accepted by the city, or the amount of the monetary contribution actually made. 
(3)  The costs or service unit equivalents used to calculate the offsets shall not exceed those assumed for the specific capital improvement included in the capital improvements plan for roadway impact fees or the actual cost of that improvement, whichever amount is less. 
(e)  Offsets shall be associated with the approved preliminary plat for the new development and shall apply to the development of all land subject to such plat. For new developments that are to be developed in phases, offsets may be created sequentially and may be applied to any undeveloped portions of the plat with which the offset is associated. The offset shall be expressed in service unit equivalents. The available offset associated with the plat shall be applied against an impact fee in the following manner: 
(1)  For single-family residential lots which have received final plat approval, the offset or credit shall be applied to reduce the impact fee equally for all such lots within the final plat at the time of final plat recordation. 
(2)  For all other types of new developments, the offset shall be applied to reduce the impact fee at the time of issuance of the first building permit, and thereafter to all subsequently issued building permits for each new development within the associated plat, until the offset has been exhausted, unless stipulated otherwise in a binding facilities agreement or a binding impact fee credit agreement. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section relating to offsets, the city in its sole discretion may choose to acquire all or a portion of any outstanding offsets associated with a new development by giving the property owner 60 days written notice of such intent and by tendering the dollar value of such offsets using schedule 1 in effect at the time the applicable offset agreement was executed. 
(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, for new developments subject to a development agreement predating the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997), which agreement provides for dedication or construction of system facilities and for offsets against roadway impact fees in proportion thereto, offsets shall apply to the amount of impact fees to be collected for each service unit pursuant to schedule 1 then in effect in accordance with the terms of such development agreement.

Sec. 130-112. - Use of proceeds of roadway impact fees. 
(a)  The impact fees collected within each roadway benefit area may be used to finance, pay for or to recoup the costs of any roadway facility identified in the roadway improvements plan for the roadway benefit area, including the construction contract price, surveying and engineering fees, land acquisition costs (including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorney's fees, and expert witness fees), and amounts designated in any reimbursement agreements executed pursuant to section 130-111. 
(b)  Impact fees may be used to pay for the contract services of an independent qualified engineer or financial consultant preparing or updating the roadway improvements plan who is not an employee of the political subdivision. 
(c)  Impact fees also may be used to pay the principal sum and interest and other finance costs on bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance such capital improvement. 
(Code 1982, § 37-90; Ord. No. 2000-03-20, § 1, 3-7-2000; Ord. No. 2001-08-091, § 1(3.10), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-055, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2003-07-062, § 1, 7-15-2003; Ord. No. 2005-11-116, § 1, 11-1-2005)  
Sec. 130-113. - Appeals. 
(a)  The property owner or applicant for a new development may appeal the following administrative decisions to the city council: 
(1)  The applicability of an impact fee to the new development; 
(2)  The amount of the impact fee due; 
(3)  The availability of, the amount of, or the expiration of an offset or a credit; 
(4)  The application of an offset against an impact fee due; 
(5)  The amount of the impact fee in proportion to the benefit received by the new development; or 
(6)  The amount of a refund due, if any. 
(b)  The appellant shall state the basis for the appeal in writing with particularity. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant to demonstrate that the amount of the fee or the amount of the offset was not calculated according to the rules set forth in this ordinance or by administrative guideline adopted by the city council. The appellant shall submit any traffic study or other documents upon which he relies to the city with the request for appeal. 
(c)  The appellant must file a notice of appeal with the city secretary within 30 days following the decision. If the notice of appeal is accompanied by a bond or other sufficient surety with offices for local presentment in a form satisfactory to the city attorney in an amount equal to the original determination of the impact fee due, the development application may be processed while the appeal is pending. 
(d)  The appellant shall promptly pay to the city the full amount of the impact fee determined to be due by the city council regarding such appeal. Failure to promptly pay such impact fee within five business days after the city council's determination on the appeal shall serve as authority for the city to present the bond or other surety to the bonding company or financial institution for performance with no other or further notice or contact with the appellant. 
(e)  Any appellant whose appeal has not been decided under Ordinance No. 97-10-54 on the effective date of this article may elect either to: 
(1)  Have the appeal decided under such ordinance; or 
(2)  Waive the appeal and pay impact fees under schedule 1 under rules established in this ordinance. 
(Code 1982, § 37-91; Ord. No. 2000-03-20, § 1, 3-7-2000; Ord. No. 2001-08-091, § 1(3.11), 8-21-2001; Ord. No. 2003-05-055, § 1, 5-20-2003; Ord. No. 2003-07-062, § 1, 7-15-2003; Ord. No. 2005-11-116, § 1, 11-1-2005; Ord. No. 2008-11-102, § 7, 11-4-2008)  
Sec. 130-114. - Refunds. 
(a)  Any impact fee or portion thereof collected pursuant to this article which has not been expended within the applicable roadway service area for an authorized purpose within ten years from the date of payment shall be refunded, upon application, to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid or, if the impact fee, was paid by another governmental entity, to such governmental entity, together with interest calculated from the date of collection to the date of refund at the statutory rate as set forth in § 302.002 of the Texas Finance Code or its successor statute. The application for refund pursuant to this section shall be submitted in writing within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period for expenditure of the fee. An impact fee shall be considered expended on a first-in, first-out basis. 
(b)  An impact fee collected pursuant to this article shall be considered expended if the total expenditures for capital improvements authorized in section 130-112 within the roadway service area within ten years following the date of payment exceed the total fees collected for such improvements during that time period. 
(c)  If a refund is due pursuant to subsections (a) or (b), the city shall prorate the refund by dividing the difference between the amount of expenditures and the amount of the fees collected by the total number of service units assumed within the roadway service area for the period to determine the refund due per service unit. The refund to the record owner shall be calculated by multiplying the refund due per service unit by the number of service units for the new development for which the fee was paid, and interest due shall be calculated upon that amount. 
(d)  If the building permit for a new development for which an impact fee has been paid has expired and a modified or new application has not been filed within six (6) months of such expiration, the city shall, upon written application, refund the amount of the impact fee to the applicant. The city may establish guidelines for refunding of impact fees collected for which construction plans have been abandoned. 
(e)  The city shall refund an impact fee to any person who has paid such fee after the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 but before the effective date of Ordinance No. 2000-03-20 (March 7, 2000), together with interest accruing from the date of collection of the fee, under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A written request for refund is filed within two years from the effective date of Ordinance No. 2000-03-20 (March 7, 2000); 
(2)  The new development for which the fee was charged is contained within a plat associated with a system facility contributed to the City after May 18, 1982 but before the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997); and 
(3)  An offset agreement for such facility has been executed pursuant to Section 130-111. 
This subsection does not apply to any new development in an area subject to a development agreement predating the effective date of Ordinance No. 97-10-54 (October 7, 1997), which agreement provides for dedication or construction of system facilities and for offsets against impact fees in proportion thereto.

Sec. 130-115. - Relief procedures. 
(a)  Any person who has paid an impact fee or an owner of land upon which an impact fee has been paid may petition the city council to determine whether any duty required by this article has not been performed within the time so prescribed. The petition shall be in writing and shall state the nature of the unperformed duty and request that the act be performed within 60 days of the request. If the city council determines that the duty is required, pursuant to the ordinance and is late in being performed, it shall cause the duty to commence within 60 days of the date of the request and to continue until completion. 
(b)  The city council may grant a variance or waiver from any requirement of this article, upon written request by a developer or owner of property subject to the ordinance, following a public hearing, and only upon finding that a strict application of such requirement would when regarded as a whole result in confiscation of the property. 
(c)  If the city council grants a variance or waiver to the amount of the impact fee due for a new development under this section, it may cause to be appropriated from other city funds the amount of the reduction in the impact fee to the account, for the roadway benefit area, in which the property is located.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 130-176. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the official stormwater management ordinance of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-177. - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, § 16.315, delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city has adopted this article as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-178. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The drainageways, creeks, and flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that may result in the loss of life and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affects the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that increase flood heights and velocities and by placing structures and other improvements that are vulnerable to floods in flood hazard areas. 
(c)  The development of land causes large quantities of soil to be displaced and transported to downstream locations. This soil displacement can create significant soil erosion and sedimentation problems. Erosion is a dangerous activity in that it contaminates water supplies and water resources. A buildup of sediment degrades water quality, destroys valuable environmental resources, and clogs watercourses and storm drains, which can cause flooding, thereby damaging public and private lands and property. These problems result in a serious threat to the health, safety, and general welfare of the city. 
(d)  Creek and floodplain areas in the city are valuable resources to the citizens of the city in that they provide recreational opportunities, improve the aesthetics of the community, convey stormwater runoff, and filter out water quality pollutants. As valuable resources, creeks and floodplains warrant protection. 
(e)  The development of land can cause significant changes in the manner, quality, frequency, rate, and volume of stormwater runoff entering a stream or lake. Changes in stormwater runoff can upset the natural balance of erosion and deposition in lakes and streams resulting in increased flooding and loss of bank stability, thus endangering adjacent public and private improvements and causing impacts to lake and stream characteristics that are generally viewed as negative. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-179. - Statement of purpose. 
This article sets forth the minimum requirements necessary to provide and maintain a safe, efficient, and effective drainage system within the city and to establish the various public and private responsibilities for the provision thereof. Further, it is the purpose of this article to: 
(1)  Protect human life, health, and property; 
(2)  Minimize the expenditure of public money for building and maintaining flood control and storm drainage projects and cleaning sediment out of storm drains, streets, sidewalks, and watercourses; 
(3)  Minimize damage due to drainage and erosion to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric service, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges; 
(4)  Help maintain a stable tax base and preserve land values; 
(5)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
(6)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; 
(7)  Preserve the natural beauty and aesthetics of the community; 
(8)  Control and manage stormwater runoff, and the sediment load in that runoff from points and surfaces within subdivisions; 
(9)  Establish a reasonable standard of design for development that prevents potential flood and erosion damage; and 
(10)  Reduce the pollutant loading to streams, ponds, and other watercourses. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-180. - Stormwater management policy. 
(a)  Purpose. Stormwater management policies shall govern the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of storm drainage and erosion control facilities within the city. This stormwater management policy is written for purposes of instruction to city staff to give guidance to draft changes to our current stormwater ordinance. For this policy to be enforceable, the ordinance must be amended to reflect this policy and approved by the city council through a public hearing process. 
(b)  Design standards. It is the policy of the city to adopt and maintain design standards that protect and provide for the safety and general welfare of the community. 
(c)  Drainage and erosion control standards. It is the policy of the city to implement drainage and erosion control standards to minimize flood damage and soil erosion to private and public facilities within the community and to protect water quality. 
(d)  Review and permit process. The review and permit process established under division 2 of this article shall be utilized by the city to provide control of development activities related to erosion control and stormwater runoff through natural and constructed facilities. 
(e)  Implementation. These stormwater management policies are defined by stormwater management ordinance No. 1773, adopted on February 16, 1988, and amendments thereto. All amendments, additions, or modifications to this article are considered effective upon the date of acceptance, in whole or in part by the city. These stormwater management policies shall apply to any stormwater management system improvement not having plans released for construction on or before the date of city council approval of revised ordinance provisions. 
(f)  Stormwater management ordinance and engineering design standards. The stormwater management ordinance and engineering design standards have been adopted by official action of the City of McKinney City Council. The stormwater management ordinance and engineering design standards, as they may be amended from time to time, are part of the official stormwater management plan for streams, channels, NRCS dams and lakes, and pipe drainage systems to the limits shown in the engineering design standards. Deviations will not be permitted unless the following criteria are met: 
(1)  It can be clearly shown by approved procedures that the deviation will not adversely affect conditions either upstream or downstream of the point of deviation; 
(2)  The owners directly affected by the deviation are in agreement; and 
(3)  The deviation is not in conflict with any other plans adopted by the city. 
Request for deviation shall be approved by the director of engineering. 
(g)  Relocation and reclamation. To implement stormwater control measures in existing areas of private ownership, the city may consider the acquisition of private land or the relocation and reclamation of existing developed areas. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 2, 5-2-2017)  
Sec. 130-181. - Scope of authority. 
Except as exempted by section 130-412, any person, firm, public utility, corporation, or business proposing to develop land or improve property within the jurisdiction of the city is subject to the provisions of this article. This article shall also apply to individual building structures, subdivisions, excavation and fill operations, and similar activities. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-182. - Lands to which this article applies. 
This article shall apply to all areas of land within the incorporated limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. Certain provisions of this article apply only to special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the city, while other provisions exempt certain other tracts. These limited areas of application are explained in section 130-381 and section 130-412. The erosion control provisions of this article do not apply to land under active agricultural use. As soon as construction or modification to the lands under active agricultural use is proposed so that the use of land will change from agriculture to any other use, then the provisions of this article shall be applicable to the previously-exempted land.

This floodway is used by FEMA to determine compliance with its regulations. 
(75)  Retention basins means a pond or other water body that has been designed to have both a conservation pool for holding some water indefinitely and a flood storage pool for storing stormwater runoff on a temporary basis for the purpose of reducing the peak discharge from the basin. 
(76)  Runoff means that portion of the excess precipitation that makes its way toward stream channels or lakes as surface or subsurface flow. When the term "runoff" is used alone, surface runoff usually is implied. 
(77)  Sediment means solid soil material, both mineral and organic, that is being moved or has been moved from its original site by wind, gravity, flowing water, or ice. Also sometimes referred to as "silt" or "sand." 
(78)  Significant rise means an increase, when rounded to the nearest 0.1 feet, in either the base flood elevation or the design flood elevation. For encroachments within the regulatory floodway, significant rise means an increase, when rounded to the nearest 0.01 feet, in the base flood elevation. 
(79)  Site plan means a plan meeting the requirements of the subdivision regulations of the city that provides a layout of a proposed project. 
(80)  Soil means the unconsolidated mineral and organic material on the immediate surface of the earth that serves as a natural medium for the growth of plants. 
(81)  Special Flood Hazard Area ("SFHA") means the land in the floodplain within a community that is subject to a one percent, or greater, chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map ("FHBM"). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A is usually refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO or V1-30, VE, or V. The SFHA is also called the base floodplain, 100-year floodplain, or one percent annual chance floodplain. 
(82)  Stabilized means to be protected from possible erosion losses, usually by mechanical means or the use of vegetative cover. 
(83)  Start of construction means, for a structure, the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "start of construction" includes substantial improvement. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction of a structure does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. 
(84)  Storm frequency means an expression or measure of how often a hydrologic event of given size or magnitude should, on an average, be equaled or exceeded. 
(85)  Structure means a walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, a substation, or a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground. When used in the context of stormwater, the term means a drainage improvement, such as a dam, levee, bridge, culvert, headwall, flume, etc. 
(86)  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before damage occurred. 
(87)  Substantial improvement means: 
a.  Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, or improvements of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the initial market value of the structure either: 
1.  Before the first improvement or repair is started; or 
2.  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
b.  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. Incremental improvements over a period of time, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value at the time of the first improvement, shall be considered a substantial improvement. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for the improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places. 
(88)  Temporary erosion control means the stabilization of erosive or sediment-producing areas for a specific time period, usually during a construction job and until stabilization is restored regardless of whether by mechanical or vegetative means. 
(89)  Ten percent rule means the basis for establishing the downstream limits of the influence that a proposed development has on the downstream drainage system as defined in the integrated stormwater management (iSWM) manual published by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). The ten percent rule is also described in the engineering design standards. 
(90)  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) means the state coordinating agency for environmental issues. 
(91)  Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) means the state coordinating agency for the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(92)  Use means any purpose for which a building or other structure or a tract of land may be designed, arranged, intended, maintained, or occupied; or any activity, occupation, business, or operation carried on, or intended to be carried on, in a building or other structure or on a tract of land. 
(93)  Use permit means the permit required before any use may be commenced. 
(94)  Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this article when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
(95)  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence, as required by the city engineer, is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(96)  Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas and behind dams. 
(97)  Watershed means the area drained by a stream or drainage system. 
(98)  Zone of influence means the area downstream of a proposed development where the discharge of the development can have a significant impact upon the receiving stream or storm drainage system, as discussed further in the engineering design standards. Said another way, it is the area where the effects of a detention pond can be felt. For additional information, refer to the integrated stormwater management (iSWM) manual published by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG).

(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 7, 5-2-2017)  
Secs. 130-194130-263. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 2. - ADMINISTRATION 
 
Sec. 130-264. - Duties of city officials. 
The director of engineering or designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement this article and other appropriate sections of 44 CFR (Emergency Management and Assistance National Flood Insurance Program Regulations) pertaining to floodplain management. The duties of the director of engineering shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Reviewing and approving or disapproving all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this article have been met and that all necessary, local, state, and federal permits have been obtained; 
(2)  Submitting and enacting the components of the municipal stormwater management program as required by TCEQ; 
(3)  Obtaining and recording the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level of the finished pad for all new residential or commercial building sites; 
(4)  Maintaining for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this article, including floodproofing certifications; 
(5)  Notifying adjacent communities and the state coordinating agency, the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), and also the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submitting evidence of such notification to FEMA; 
(6)  Requiring that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished; 
(7)  Making interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions; 
(8)  Obtaining, reviewing, and reasonably utilizing any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state, or other source in order to administer this article when base flood elevation data has not been provided;

(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 8, 5-2-2017)  
Sec. 130-265. - Responsibilities of owners. 
(a)  The owner or developer of a property shall be responsible for all storm drainage flowing through or abutting such property. Construction of stormwater detention facilities only relieves the owner or developer of any responsibility for off-site drainage improvements with the exception of the NRCS lakes provisions of this article and does not relieve an owner or developer of the responsibility for improvements on-site or adjacent to a proposed development. This responsibility also includes drainage directed to that property by ultimate development as well as the drainage naturally flowing through the property by reason of topography. 
(b)  The owner, builder, or developer of a property shall be responsible for any silt or soils transported from the property by drainage. 
(c)  Where the improvement or construction of a storm drainage facility is required along a property line common to two or more owners, the owner hereafter proposing the development of the property shall be responsible for obtaining the necessary permits, making the required improvements at the time of development, and acquiring or dedicating the necessary rights-of-way or easements to accommodate the improvements. The initial owner or developer may recover a portion of the cost from the adjacent owner or developer in accordance with a predetermined facilities agreement. 
(d)  Where an applicant proposes development or use of only a portion of the property, provisions for storm drainage and erosion control shall only be required in that portion of the property proposed for immediate development, except as construction or improvements of a drainage facility or erosion controls outside that designated portion of the property are deemed essential to the development of that designated portion or if the remainder parcel is not large enough to support the required improvements financially. 
(e)  Floodplain and surface drainage easements shall be maintained by the property owner; save and except subsurface structure maintenance as provided by section 130-189; or where maintenance is otherwise expressly assumed by the city. Regardless of maintenance responsibility, adequate maintenance easements and physical access alongside and to and from the easements so conveyed shall be provided. 
(f)  The owner and developer shall use their best efforts to protect trees and vegetation during and after all development activities. To the extent practicable, trees removed along natural channels by stormwater improvements shall be replaced in accordance with the city's tree preservation ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 9, 5-2-2017)  
Sec. 130-266. - Plat approval; development permit. 
The city has several approval processes and permits related to storm drainage and floodplains. These processes and permits are listed below and explained in detail in the following subsections. 
(1)  Platting process. In accordance with the city's subdivision regulations, a construction plan and profile sheets for all public improvements, including drainage facilities, shall be submitted with the record plat. Approval of the record plat is contingent upon city's approval of the construction plans. The required information to be shown on the construction plans for drainage facilities can be found in the engineering design standards. Platting of public drainage systems, drainage channels, and floodplains require: 
a.  Dedication of drainage easements. Public drainage systems designed to convey the design storm runoff shall be contained within a drainage easement or a floodplain easement or property dedicated to the public for that purpose. Drainage easements shall be established such that no parcel will be landlocked as a result of the platting action. 
b.  Platting of property along drainage channels. Future platting along streams and drainage channels within the 100-year floodplain, based on fully developed watershed conditions, will require dedication of a floodplain easement. The developer platting the property shall enter into a hold-harmless agreement with the city on behalf of the current and future land owners, or shall include language on the record plat, approved by the city, that relieves the city of any responsibility for future channel or bank stabilization or tree protection measures along the channel. The record plat language shall identify and obligate the responsible party(s) to address any sediment, erosion, or flooding related issues emanating from the reach of the creek in question that is adversely affecting private property. The agreement shall be filed for record with Collin County and shall be a covenant running with the land clearly obligating current and/or future owners to the conditions of the agreement. 
c.  Platting of detention/retention facilities. Detention and retention facilities and all associated appurtenances shall be contained within a drainage easement. The record plat shall include language that obligates the property owner to perform all maintenance of stormwater detention and retention facilities consistent with section 130-358(c) and shall hold the city harmless from and against any damages to persons, to the owner's lot, or any other affected lot arising from such maintenance or lack thereof. 
d.  Erosion hazard setbacks. Erosion hazard setbacks will be utilized to provide stream bank protection for all streams within the city. In all cases, a buffer shall be created and protected by easement for the determined setbacks. The setback limits may be altered through mechanical stream bank protection if such mechanical stabilization is approved by the director of engineering and record platted consistent with the protected bank area. Where erosion hazard setback easements are established, no building, fence, wall, deck, swimming pool, or other structure shall be located, constructed, or maintained within the area encompassing the setback. The exception to this restriction shall be any hike and bike trail dedicated to the city which may be constructed within the outer ten feet of the determined erosion hazard setback easement or as otherwise determined appropriate by the director of engineering. The setback requirement for each stream or channel shall be determined as described in the engineering design manual and shall be shown on the record plat. The channel and the area adjacent to the channel shall be platted as a common area lot to be owned and maintained by the applicable homeowners' association. This common area lot shall encompass all of the erosion hazard setback easement. Commercial developments are exempt from platting the erosion hazard setback easement as a dedicated common area. 
(2)  Development permit (floodprone areas). All developers, owners, or builders shall submit a floodplain application and obtain a development permit before beginning any projects in floodplain areas, such as constructing new buildings and infrastructure, filling land, altering waterways, substantially improving existing structures located in flood hazard areas or channelizing, impounding, realigning, deepening or other altering of a natural drainageway. Application forms can be obtained from the director of engineering. The director of engineering uses the application, along with duplicate copies of the accompanying engineering or architectural plans, to identify those construction or renovation projects that would occur in a special flood hazard area. The engineering design manual identifies the information that must be submitted to the director of engineering as part of the permit application. Construction or renovation projects cannot begin until the city issues the development permit, and building permits cannot be issued before obtaining a development permit. 
(3)  Proceeding without applicable permits. Any developer, owner, or builder who fails to obtain a development permit before beginning a project is in violation of this article. In addition to the penalties outlined in section 130-193, no building permit, plat, site plan, certificate of occupancy, or other use permit shall be issued for any construction, reconstruction, or development upon any land where such construction, reconstruction, or development is not in conformity with the requirements and intent of this article. Anyone who violates any of the terms and provisions of this article shall be denied the use permit until the violation is corrected. The city floodplain administrator shall not approve or forward application materials for altering the federal flood insurance maps to FEMA until the application materials are in compliance with the terms of this article. No land disturbing activity for development purposes may be undertaken on undeveloped land until a site plan has been approved and a development or building permit has been issued. Plans for any associated land disturbing off-site improvements shall be submitted and approved along with the site plan. Any infrastructure construction not related to a site plan shall require approval of construction plans prior to issuance of a development permit. 
(4)  Deviations from permit terms. Permits may be revoked by the director of engineering if, upon periodic inspection, it is determined that the work is not progressing in accordance with specifications of the approved plan and permit, or if he determines that erosion from a building or construction site is not being controlled in a satisfactory manner. 
(5)  Field changes to storm sewer plans; record of as-built drawings. Field changes to storm sewer plans can be made upon the approval of the director of engineering. Record of as-built drawings of storm sewers shall be submitted to the director of engineering at the completion of the project. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 10, 5-2-2017; Ord. No. 2018-04-029, §§ 2, 3, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 130-267. - Plan requirements. 
Application materials and plan requirements for storm sewers or floodplain alterations are listed below. All engineering plans for storm sewers, floodplain alteration projects, and tracts greater than one acre in size shall be sealed by a professional engineer who is registered in the state and experienced in civil engineering work. The total cost for preparing the engineering plans and implementing the plans shall be borne by the applicant. 
(1)  Storm drainage plans. As part of the platting process, storm drainage plans shall be prepared. These plans shall include drainage facilities for both off-site and on-site drainage, so that the proper transition between the two can be maintained. Criteria for on-site development shall also apply to off-site improvements. The construction of all improvements shall be in accordance with the current specifications and regulations adopted by the city. Storm drainage plans shall be prepared in accordance with the engineering design manual. 
(2)  Application materials for development permits. Owners or builders who are planning to renovate existing structures or construct new structures shall apply for a building permit. Prior to submitting an application for a building permit the owner or builder shall determine whether the property on which such existing or proposed structures are situated, or will be situated, is located within a flood-prone area. If the property is located within a flood-prone area the owners or builders shall submit a floodplain permit application. Such floodplain permit application shall be submitted and a floodplain permit issued to the owner or builder by the city prior to the owner's or builder's submission of an application for a building permit. If the owner or builder fails to obtain a floodplain permit before submitting an application for building permit and the city's floodplain administrator and/or city staff determines during the permit review that the proposed project is located in a flood-prone area, then any further review and approval of a building permit shall be suspended and withheld until such time as the building permit applicant applies for and receives a floodplain permit and a development permit through the director of engineering as provided in section 130-266(2). The owner or builder shall submit for review duplicate copies of the appropriate materials as required by the engineering design manual. Owners or developers who are proposing to build or expand subdivisions shall submit a floodplain application and a development permit application as provided in section 130-266(2). If the owner or developer proposing to build or expand subdivisions fails to obtain a floodplain permit before submitting an application for a building permit and the city staff determines the proposed work to be in flood hazard areas, then any further review and approval of a building permit shall be suspended and withheld until such time as the applicant applies for and receives a floodplain permit and a development permit through the director of engineering as provided in section 130-266(2). The owner or developer shall submit for review duplicate copies of the additional appropriate materials outlined in the engineering design manual. 
It is recommended that applicants coordinate the application materials listed with those needed with other city permits and with the data requirements of FEMA. Such coordination will facilitate staff review, and drawings could be combined to save the applicant from making multiple drawings. 
(3)  Water quality protection. McKinney's stormwater management program requires that all new development and redevelopment projects provide water quality protection by implementation of post construction, structural, and non-structural best management practices. Prior to the start of construction activities for both new development and redevelopment, developers and/or builders must submit a detailed post construction water quality protection plan, incorporating current and appropriate best management practices to the director of engineering for review and approval. A maintenance plan for the approved water quality BMPs must be included with the plan submittal. Maintenance performance for the approved plan shall be the responsibility of the HOA or property owner and this maintenance performance responsibility must be clearly indicated on the record plat. The specific requirements for a water quality protection plan and guidelines for water quality protection BMPs can be found in the engineering design manual.

DIVISION 3. - DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS 
 
Sec. 130-300. - Impact of runoff on downstream facilities. 
Stormwater runoff, based on fully developed watershed conditions, is allowed from all new developments provided that throughout the downstream zone of influence: 
(1)  The receiving drainage facilities and/or natural channels have the capacity to convey the fully developed 100-year storm event with appropriate freeboard, 
(2)  The fully developed 100-year storm event is conveyed within public right-of-way or existing drainage and/or floodplain easements, and 
(3)  The increased volume of runoff does not have an adverse impact on downstream properties. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 13, 5-2-2017)  
Sec. 130-301. - Drainage improvements required for development. 
(a)  All drainage systems, whether upstream, downstream, or on-site, shall be designed for fully developed watershed conditions, unless directed otherwise by the director of engineering. 
(b)  All developments shall provide for any new drainage facilities, the improvement of any existing drainage facilities, channel improvements, grading, driveway adjustments, culvert improvements, or any other improvement, drainage facility, or work that is necessary to provide for the stormwater drainage needs of the development and to protect property situated downstream of the development. At all storm sewer outfall points, discharges shall be limited to non-erosive velocities or the discharge point shall be stabilized by the developer. 
(c)  Regarding downstream impacts, the developer shall do the following: 
(1)  Provide on-site detention facilities to limit the peak discharge of the development to pre-project levels for both the five-year and 100-year storm events at the point(s) of discharge; or 
(2)  Study downstream facilities throughout the zone of influence to determine if: 
a.  The receiving drainage facilities and/or natural channels have the capacity to convey the fully developed 100-year storm event with appropriate freeboard, and 
b.  The fully developed 100-year storm event is conveyed within public right of way or existing drainage and/or floodplain easements. 
(3)  If the study determines that the necessary capacity with appropriate freeboard does not exist, the developer must construct the improvements to provide the necessary capacity or provide on-site detention facilities. 
(4)  If the study determines that the drainage and/or floodplain easements do not exist, the developer must obtain the necessary easements or provide on-site detention facilities. 
(d)  A downstream assessment may be required if the director of engineering has reason to believe that on-site detention may increase the fully developed 100-year peak flow due to coincidental peaks. If the assessment demonstrates coincidental peaks, on-site detention facilities will not be an acceptable option. Downstream improvements may be required if downstream capacity and easements are inadequate to convey the increased site flow. This will be determined by the director of engineering on a case-by-case basis. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 14, 5-2-2017)  
Sec. 130-302. - Drainage of residential lots. 
Existing drainage between developed lots will remain the responsibility of the affected property owners. Future developments are required to drain surface runoff from an individual lot to a public right-of-way or to a drainage system contained in a drainage easement. The director of engineering shall have the discretion to allow modifications to the lot-to-lot drainage requirements where adherence to these requirements would be in conflict with the tree preservation ordinance or where the lot size is one-fourth acre or larger, and it is determined by the director of engineering to not pose a burden on a future property owner. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 15, 5-2-2017)

DIVISION 4. - SPECIAL DRAINAGE FACILITIES 
 
Sec. 130-355. - Channels. 
(a)  Channel design. Unless approved by the director of engineering, open channels shall not be permitted when the inside pipe diameter required to carry the fully developed 100-year flow is 60 inches or less. Exceptions to this prohibition might be residential estate subdivisions and other areas where there are significant natural features, including trees, springs, exposed channels, and other environmental items that would work positively into the aesthetics of a development. Criteria for determining the nature of open channels is found in the engineering design manual. 
(b)  Starting water surface condition. When performing hydraulic analyses for channel or drainageway design, the starting water surface shall be based on the criteria found in the engineering design standards. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 16, 5-2-2017; Ord. No. 2018-04-029, § 5, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 130-356. - Lakes and dams. 
(a)  All existing dams located on a property to be developed shall meet the criteria listed below and current TCEQ dam safety standards. If necessary, the property owner or developer shall upgrade existing dams to meet the criteria listed below and current TCEQ dam safety standards. 
(b)  In the event that a property owner or developer desires to modify an existing pond or lake or desires to impound stormwater by filling or constructing an aboveground dam, thereby creating a lake, pond, lagoon, or basin as part of the planned development of that property, the criteria listed below shall be met before city approval of the impoundment can be given. Ponds or lakes created by excavation of a channel area without erecting a dam above natural ground elevation or in-stream low water check dams are also subject to the criteria listed below, with the exception of spillway capacity requirements. The director of engineering has the final authority to determine the design criteria for a proposed dam, check dam, or excavated lake. The requirements of the state must also be met for the construction of dams, lakes, and other impoundments. 
(c)  The design criteria for a dam are dependent on the size and hazard classification of the dam. The size and hazard classification will be based on the recommended guidelines adopted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) under V.T.C.A., Water Code § 12.052, which provides for the safe construction, maintenance, repair, and removal of dams located in the state, and will be determined by the director of engineering based on information furnished by the owner. The following criteria will be used to classify a dam: 
(1)  Size. The classification for size is based on the height of the dam and storage capacity, whichever gives the larger size category. The term "height" is defined as the distance between the top of the dam and the existing streambed at the downstream toe. The term "storage" is defined as the maximum water volume impounded at the top of the dam. 
(2)  Hazard classification. The hazard classification for a dam is a measure of the potential loss of life, property damage, and/or economic impact of the area downstream of the dam in the event of a failure or malfunction of the dam and/or any appurtenant structures. 
(3)  Spillway design flood. 
a.  The classification of a dam based on the above criteria will be used to determine the spillway design flood (SDF). The total capacity of a dam structure, including principal and emergency spillways, shall be adequate to pass the SDF without exceeding the top of dam elevation. The SDFs for various dam classifications are shown in the engineering design manual. 
b.  In all cases, the minimum principal spillway design capacity is the total 100-year inflow design flood assuming fully developed upstream conditions. 
c.  In all cases, a dam breach analysis shall be required to determine the proper hazard classification of the structure. A dam breach analysis is required to determine the downstream consequences of a failure for all dams over six feet in height. If the consequences of a breach failure are determined to pose a significant threat to life or properties, the spillway design flood will be equal to the probable maximum flood (PMF). All dams shall be constructed with a minimum freeboard of two feet above the SDF elevation except in the case of dam designed to pass the PMF, which will have top of dam set at the maximum water surface achieved by the passage of the PMF. See section 130-357 for NRCS dam requirements. 
(d)  Maintenance and liability criteria. 
(1)  The owner or developer shall retain their private ownership of the constructed lake, pond, lagoon, or basin and shall assume full responsibility for the protection of the general public from any health or safety hazards related to the lake, pond, lagoon, or basin constructed. For NRCS assisted watershed dams, the land and lakes are in private ownership, with operation and maintenance of the dam and its appurtenances provided by the city or by the county and the County Soil and Water Conservation District. 
(2)  The owner or developer shall assume full responsibility for the maintenance of the lake, pond, lagoon, or basin constructed. The owner or developer shall keep the director of engineering advised of the currently responsible agent for this maintenance. 
(3)  The developer shall develop and submit an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for any dam associated with the above as required by TCEQ. A copy of the EAP shall also be provided to the director of engineering. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 17, 5-2-2017; Ord. No. 2018-04-029, § 6, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 130-357. - Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) lakes. 
(a)  There are a number of Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) assisted watershed dams and lakes within the city limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. These dams and lakes were constructed to NRCS (previously Soil Conservation Service) and TCEQ standards. Although the land and lakes are in private ownership, the dams are maintained according to the operations and maintenance agreement pertaining to each dam. NRCS lakes provide stormwater retention and water quality enhancement as a design feature. This retention volume was considered in the design of the structure and shall be maintained with regard to their original design to collect silt from stormwater runoff and to provide regional flood control. The city is responsible for floodplain management of those areas upstream, downstream, and adjacent to the lakes. 
(b)  The city shall control future development upstream, downstream, and adjacent to all NRCS dams and lakes. Planning for future development that impacts on or is impacted by NRCS dams shall require a detailed engineering study to provide a technical basis for development. Design for upgrading dams shall comply with other sections of this article and the engineering design manual. Furthermore, the dam shall be upgraded as follows: 
(1)  Provide principal spillway capacity adequate to discharge the routed 100-year flood event based on fully developed watershed conditions and limited to constraints including both hydraulic capacity and channel stability immediately downstream; 
(2)  Provide total capacity of the dam structure, including principal and auxiliary spillways to accommodate the probable maximum flood (PMF); 
(3)  Maintain existing flood storage and planned sediment storage capacities; 
(4)  Prohibit upstream development within the contour line determined by the auxiliary spillway crest elevation plus two feet, or the routed 100-year flood elevation (based on fully developed watershed conditions and the improved dam) plus two feet, whichever elevation is greater. In addition, the areas required for reasonable maintenance access to the lake, dam, and associated appurtenances and for safe operation of the spillway for the existing and rehabilitated dam shall be preserved and protected from encroachment through easement. These easements shall be described by a metes and bounds survey; and 
(5)  Restrict development and improvements within the floodplain established by a breach flow analysis from the dam to the downstream limit of the dam breach impact. Commercial development may be allowed below NRCS dams that have been rehabilitated to safely pass the PMF, if conditions warrant and with approval of the director of engineering. 
(c)  The detailed study of the NRCS floodwater retarding structure shall include an evaluation of the existing lake sediment level. 
(d)  At the discretion of the director of engineering, a developer may, in lieu of upgrading an NRCS floodwater retarding structure, offer a contribution toward the future upgrade of the structure. However, easements as described in subsection (b)(4) of this section shall be required. 
(e)  A metes and bounds description of an easement with elevation two feet above the emergency spillway elevation or an elevation two feet above the routed 100-year flood elevation, whichever is higher, shall be provided on a plat prior to filing. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 18, 5-2-2017; Ord. No. 2018-04-029, § 7, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 130-358. - Detention and retention facilities. 
(a)  Detention/retention facilities may be required to reduce runoff rates due to inadequate storm drainage facilities or increased zoning resulting in a significant increase in runoff rates, volume or frequency. Where detention is required and practicable, regional detention is encouraged. Calculations to verify downstream adequacy of hydraulic capacity shall be performed in accordance with the ten percent rule as defined in section 130-183. If an approved study demonstrates that the downstream facilities and stream system can adequately convey the fully developed 100-year storm event and required easements exist or can be obtained, then detention is not required. 
(b)  Detention/retention facilities shall be designed to safely pass all storms up to and including the fully developed 100-year storm event according to criteria in the engineering design manual. 
(c)  Detention/retention facilities shall be required to have a maintenance plan that considers debris removal, mowing, trimming, and a regular inspection schedule. The plan shall be provided to the director of engineering and implemented by the property owner. The minimum maintenance requirements therefor may be found in the engineering design manual.

DIVISION 5. - FLOODPLAIN GUIDELINES 
 
Sec. 130-381. - Lands to which this article applies. 
Floodplain areas shall include all areas inundated by the fully developed 100-year flood and special flood hazard areas shown in the flood insurance study and on the FEMA flood insurance rate maps for the county dated June 7, 2017, and subsequent amendments thereto. Applicants shall comply with the requirements of this article for floodplain areas before making substantial improvements to or increasing the outside dimensions of an existing structure or developing land within the floodplain as defined above. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014; Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 20, 5-2-2017)  
Sec. 130-382. - General floodplain regulations. 
Utilization of natural floodplains shall be the preferred consideration in providing stormwater management control within the city. Where maintaining natural floodplains is deemed impractical by the city, structural improvements and drainage systems will be designed and constructed to minimize adverse impact on the floodplain. 
(a)  Permitted uses of floodplain areas. 
(1)  To minimize possible losses of life and property, the following uses are permitted in a floodplain area, provided such uses are also permitted in the underlying zoning district:

(b)  Regional detention/retention of stormwater runoff. Existing NRCS lakes provide for up to 200 acre feet of stormwater retention within the constructed sediment pool as a design feature. This volume was considered in establishment of the design flood and shall be maintained below the level of the designed flood pool, or restored in lakes being improved. In addition, the flood pools of these facilities were sized to accommodate a specific volume of flood storage and this volume shall not be reduced in any case. 
(c)  Residential construction. 
(1)  New construction in reclaimed floodplain areas and substantial improvements of any existing residential structure in floodplain areas shall have the lowest floor, including basements or fully enclosed areas, elevated to at least two feet above either the base flood or the fully developed 100-year flood elevation, whichever elevation is greater. Pad elevations for residential lots raised out of the floodplain shall be at least one foot above the elevation of either the base flood or the fully developed 100-year flood elevation, whichever elevation is greater. Incremental improvements, either at one time or over a period of time, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value at the time of the first improvement, shall be considered as a substantial improvement. New residential structures on stilts or behind ring levees serving individual lots shall not be permitted. 
(2)  Improvements to an existing residential structure located within a designated floodplain that increase the outside dimensions, but that do not result in making a substantial improvement to that structure, must meet the floodproofing requirements of subsection (l) of this section. 
(d)  Nonresidential construction. 
(1)  New construction in reclaimed floodplain areas and substantial improvement of any existing commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure in floodplain areas shall either have the lowest floor, including basements, elevated to at least two feet above either the base flood or the fully developed 100-year flood elevation, whichever elevation is greater, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall: 
a.  Be floodproofed so that, below two feet above the design flood elevation, the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the director of engineering; and 
d.  Meet the requirements of subsection (l) of this section. 
(2)  Incremental improvements, either at one time or over a period of time, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value at the time of the first improvement, shall be considered as a substantial improvement. Improvements to an existing commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure that increase the outside dimensions, but do not result in a substantial improvement, must meet the requirements of subsection (l) of this section. 
(e)  Manufactured homes. 
(1)  All existing manufactured homes located within either a FEMA or fully developed floodplain shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. Special requirements shall be that: 
a.  Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of the manufactured home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations, with manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side; 
b.  Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five additional ties per side at intermediate points, with manufactured homes less than 50 feet long requiring four additional ties per side; 
c.  All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and 
d.  Any additions to the manufactured home be similarly anchored. 
(2)  For all new manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions; for expansions to existing manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions; for existing manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, or improvement of the streets, utilities, and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities, and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement has commenced; for manufactured homes not placed in a manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision; and for new manufactured homes moved into an existing site in an existing manufactured home park, require that: 
a.  Stands or lots are elevated on compacted fill, so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home will be at least two feet above the design flood elevation; 
b.  Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler are provided; and 
c.  No new manufactured homes shall be placed in a floodplain, except on a pad site created by compacted fill in which the new pad site is elevated so that the lowest finished floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least two feet above the design flood elevation. 
(3)  Table 11 summarizes the requirements for manufactured homes in floodplain areas. 
(f)  Recreational vehicles. A recreational vehicle placed on a site in an SFHA shall: 
(1)  Meet the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes; or 
(2)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
(3)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. "Ready for highway use" means that it is on its wheels or jacking system is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and has no permanently attached additions. 
(g)  Streets, parking lots, and bridges. 
(1)  The top of the curb or street crown of all new streets to be built in reclaimed floodplain areas shall be at least one foot above the design flood elevation. 
(2)  The low beam of all new bridges to be constructed across floodplains shall be a minimum of one foot above the design flood elevation. 
(3)  All new private bridges to individual homes shall have their low beams at one foot above the design flood elevation. 
(4)  To the extent practicable, street crossings and bridges shall be designed such that, if a larger flood or blockage should occur, they do not cause flood damages of areas that would otherwise not flood (overflow back to the creek). 
(5)  Parking lots associated with residential uses in reclaimed floodplain areas shall be at least at the design flood elevation. 
(6)  Parking lots for commercial and industrial uses may be built at one foot below the design flood elevation. 
(7)  Parking lots for public parks or playgrounds, private recreation clubs or areas, private community centers, and golf courses may be located below the design flood elevation. 
(h)  Utilities. All new and replacement water supply systems, sanitary sewer facilities, and other public utilities shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(i)  Fences. In any floodplain or positive overflow areas, fences (private and public screening) shall be constructed such that blockage or diversion of surface water flow does not occur. No fence having openings less than ten feet measured horizontally, by one foot measured vertically, may be constructed within an effective flow area and perpendicular to the direction of flow. Breakaway fences may be approved by the director of engineering. 
(j)  Trees. The planting of trees in existing drainage channels, designated floodways, floodway easements, floodplain effective flow areas, positive overflow areas, or on slopes greater than 4:1 is prohibited unless it is for the purpose of replacing trees destroyed by stormwater improvements as cited in section 130-265(f) or if approved by the director of engineering. Trees may be planted outside of these areas, but within the erosion hazard setback, so long as a 15-foot wide maintenance path would not be blocked by the planting of such trees. 
(k)  Fill areas. Where fill is proposed for placement to raise the ground surface, design engineers proposing the reclamation shall demonstrate that the fill will not settle below the design elevation of the fill through proper compaction; and that the fill will be adequately protected from erosion, scour, or differential settlement. Fill slopes shall be permanently protected from erosion losses by grassing, establishing vegetative cover approved by the director of engineering, or installing channel linings or stabilization measures when allowed by the other provisions of this article. Additional fill requirements are included in section 130-383. 
(l)  Additional construction standards for structures. All substantial improvements and new construction permitted in a floodplain area must comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Structures must be securely anchored to the foundation to prevent flotation and collapse during inundation and designed to prevent damage to nonstructural elements during inundation. 
(2)  Thermal insulation used below the first floor elevation must be of a type that does not absorb water. 
(3)  Adhesives must have a bonding strength that is unaffected by inundation. 
(4)  Doors and all wood trim must be sealed with a waterproof paint or similar product. 
(5)  Mechanical, electrical and utility equipment shall be located above the fully developed 100-year flood elevation. 
(6)  Water heaters, furnaces, electrical distribution panels and other critical mechanical or electrical installations must not be placed in basements. Electrical circuits for basements shall be separate from circuits serving floors above the basement, and circuits for basements shall be installed lowered from above. 
(7)  Basements are permitted for nonresidential structures only if they are designed to preclude inundation by the design flood elevation, either by: 
a.  The elimination of exterior openings below the design flood elevation; or 
b.  The use of watertight closures, such as bulkheads and flood shields. However, no basements are permitted in soils whose permeability meets or exceeds the minimum local standards of permeability established for the installation of individual sewer disposal systems. 
(8)  Plywood used at or below the lowest floor elevation must be of an exterior or marine grade and of a water-resistant or waterproof variety. 
(9)  Wood flooring used at or below the lowest floor elevation must be installed to accommodate a lateral expansion of the flooring, perpendicular to the flooring grain, without incurring structural damage to the building. 
(10)  Basement ceilings for nonresidential structures must be of sufficient wet strength and be so installed as to survive inundation. 
(11)  Paints or other finishes used at or below the lowest floor elevation must be capable of surviving inundation.

Sec. 130-383. - Criteria for approval of floodplain alterations. 
(a)  No new construction is allowed in floodplain areas, but construction is allowed in those areas that can be reclaimed from the floodplain. Portions of the 100-year floodplain, based on fully developed conditions, may be reclaimed; provided that there is not a significant rise in the water surface elevation, acceptable velocities are maintained, and channel stability is maintained in the reach being reclaimed. Additionally, in any stream with a contributing watershed of 200 acres or more at the point of a proposed development, an equivalent volume of valley storage must be provided in the same reach to offset any fill placed in the floodplain. Arterial roadway and/or pedestrian bridge projects may be exempt from the valley storage requirement. A development permit for floodplain reclamation or alteration for all types of reclamation shall be allowed only if all of the following criteria are met: 
(1)  Alterations shall be in compliance with FEMA guidelines. A portion of the 100-year floodplain may be reclaimed provided there is no upstream or downstream increase in the water surface elevation and acceptable channel stability and velocities are maintained. 
(2)  Any alteration of floodplain areas shall not cause any additional expense in any current or projected public improvements. 
(3)  Maximum slopes of filled areas or excavated areas not in sound rock shall not exceed three to one (three horizontal to one vertical). Any city-maintained land shall be at least on a four-to-one slope regardless of the existence of rock with the following exceptions: When proposed as part of a landscape plan, fill slopes, vertical walls, terracing and other slope treatments may be considered where public safety and maintenance are not jeopardized and where no unbalancing of stream flow or upsetting of the channel's stability results. 
(4)  Alterations to the floodplain are permitted without consideration to the water surface elevations when the entire floodplain is on the owner's, builder's or developer's own property. No rise in water surface elevations of the fully developed 100-year flood event of the creek is permitted on adjacent properties unless the rise is fully contained within a floodplain or drainage easement. 
(5)  Alterations to the floodplain shall not create an erosive or aggradational flow velocity on either side of a natural channel adjacent to floodplain reclamation, whether on- or off-site, in any flood event up to and including the fully developed 100-year flood event. 
(6)  The effects of existing improvements, or public and private improvements for which a future commitment has been made by the city or county, state or federal agencies, shall be used in determining water surface elevations and velocities. 
(7)  The floodplain shall be altered only to the extent permitted by equal conveyance on both sides of the natural channel. The right of equal conveyance applies to all owners and uses, including greenbelt, park areas and recreational usages. Owners may relinquish their right to equal conveyance by providing a written agreement to the city. 
(8)  When constructing a swale parallel to the main channel, which swale also ties to the main channel, the lowest elevation of excavated areas shall not be lower than one-third of the depth of the main channel, as measured down from the top of bank of the main channel, or the water surface elevation resulting from the one-year flood, whichever is lower. The director of engineering may consider an exception to this provision, depending upon the distance between the swale and the main channel and with the provision of appropriate stabilization of the swale outfall. The upstream end of the excavation area shall not tie into the creek, and no excavation shall be closer than 50 feet to the bank of the natural channel, except as necessary to drain. Excavation of lakes may exceed the depth indicated above. In any case, excavation in the floodplain shall not cause or allow a diversion of flood flows outside the FEMA floodway. 
(9)  Relocation or alteration of natural streams shall not be permitted without: 
a.  An environmental evaluation, the scope of which will be determined by the director of engineering; and 
b.  Appropriate permitting by state and federal regulators. 
(b)  The criteria in subsection (a) of this section shall be met before a floodplain, grading and/or development permit can be issued for a proposed project. Typical projects requiring a floodplain permit or a development permit include placing fill, whether or not it actually raises the property out of the floodplain; constructing a dam; straightening channel sections; temporary storage of fill materials, supplies and equipment; creating on- or off-line lakes; installing retaining walls or other creek side-slope protection; changing the streambed gradient; constructing a swale parallel to the main channel; and making improvements, substantial or otherwise, to existing structures in a floodplain in which the existing outside dimensions of the structure are increased. 
(c)  The required submittals for a floodplain, grading or development permit are listed in section 130-267(2). The flood routing and modeling requirements needed for projects involving floodplain areas can be found in the engineering design manual. Flood routing information shall be used to ensure any changes in floodplain valley storage will not cause downstream increases in water surface elevations. 
(d)  Applicants can obtain copies of the existing conditions backwater models and flood-routing where available from the director of engineering. These models shall be kept current with modification to the floodplains at the expense of the party making the changes.

Sec. 130-384. - Verification of floodplain alterations. 
(a)  Prior to final city acceptance of utilities and street construction for projects involving floodplain alterations or adjacent to defined floodplains, creeks, channels, and drainageways, a certified statement shall be prepared by a registered professional land surveyor, or a licensed professional engineer, showing that all lot elevations, as developed within the subject project, meet or exceed the required minimum finished pad elevations necessary to create the minimum finished floor elevations as shown on the record plat of the subdivision. This certification shall be filed with the director of engineering. 
(b)  In addition, at any time in the future when a building permit is desired for an existing platted property, which is subject to flooding or carries a specified or recorded minimum finished floor elevation, a registered professional land surveyor or a registered professional engineer shall prepare a certified statement that sites are built to the design elevations. The certified survey data showing the property to be at or above the specified elevation shall be furnished to the chief building official for approval. A certificate of compliance with the provisions of this article, pertaining to specified finished floor elevations, shall be required. 
(c)  The applicants shall furnish, at their expense, to the director of engineering the above certifications and any other certified engineering and surveying information requested by the director of engineering to confirm that the required minimum floor and pad elevations have been achieved. Save and except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, building permits will not be issued until: 
(1)  A letter of map revision or amendment has been issued by FEMA; and 
(2)  Lots and/or sites are certified by a registered professional land surveyor or a registered professional engineer that they are elevated from the floodplain according to FEMA-approved revisions to the floodplain and the requirements of this article. 
(d)  As an alternative to the above requirements the following procedure may be used to obtain subdivision acceptance, record a final plat which includes a lot, and/or obtain a building permit for a lot within an area shown as flood plain on an existing FEMA map that is proposed to be reclaimed pursuant to, and prior to the approval of a letter of map revision (LOMR) by FEMA: 
(1)  A city reviewed and approved conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) must have been submitted to and approved by FEMA. 
(2)  The infrastructure must have been constructed in accordance with plans and specifications, accepted by the city, and in substantial conformance with the FEMA-approved CLOMR as determined by the floodplain administrator. 
(3)  A LOMR must have been submitted to and approved by the city, and then submitted to and receipt acknowledged by FEMA. 
(4)  A record plat that includes the lot must have been approved that includes the proposed revised floodplain line (the floodplain line on the then effective FEMA map will not be shown) and the following form of note prominently affixed on the record plat: The floodplain line shown on this plat represents a proposed floodplain line that has been designated on a FEMA-approved CLOMR Number X-XXXX, for which a LOMR has been submitted and after approval of which LOMR, if it is approved by FEMA, will become the effective FEMA floodplain delineation. 
(5)  An elevation certificate must have been issued confirming that the pad elevation for the lot is at or above the proposed adjacent base flood elevation shown on the submitted LOMR. 
(6)  The developer must present to the city a signed affidavit affirming that the proposed lot is currently within the flood plain as shown on the effective FEMA FIRM and that flood insurance must be obtained and maintained in order to receive a final green tag or certificate of occupancy prior to the effective date of FEMA approval of the LOMR. 
(7)  An agreement must be entered into between the city and the developer that contains the following provisions and attachments: 
a.  An executed engineering contract between the developer and its engineer covering the scope of services required to complete the LOMR process (the "engineering contract"), conditionally assigned to the city; 
b.  An escrow of funds/bond in an amount equal to 120 percent of the cost of the work remaining under the engineering contract relating to the LOMR process to ensure the completion of the LOMR process; and 
c.  A provision acceptable to the city attorney whereby the developer indemnifies the city from and against any and all claims that might arise out of or be related to this alternative process. 
(8)  In order to obtain a final green tag or certificate of occupancy as appropriate for a habitable structure on the lot, the following must be accomplished: 
a.  All other requirements for the final approval have been met; 
b.  The record plat that includes the lot has been filed; and 
c.  Proof that a policy of flood insurance written by an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of Texas and authorized to issue flood insurance policies, prepaid for up to two years as determined by the director of development services, has been issued for all habitable structures on the lot. 
(9)  Subsequent to issuance of a green tag or a certificate of occupancy but prior to a property buyer taking ownership of the property, the property buyer shall sign an affidavit that acknowledges the property buyer agrees and understands: 
a.  The improvements on the lot are located in an area shown on the effective FEMA FIRM as being in the floodplain; 
b.  A letter of map revision has been sent to FEMA which, if approved, will modify the FIRM such that the improvements will no longer be shown as being located within the floodplain; 
c.  FEMA may not approve the LOMR; 
d.  If FEMA does not approve the LOMR the improvements will continue to be shown as being in the floodplain and the property buyer's right to use, repair, replace, restore, rebuild or expand the improvements may be limited or even prohibited; 
e.  The property buyer is assuming the foregoing risks and agrees to indemnify and hold the city harmless from and against any and all claims arising out of the absence of a FEMA approved LOMR; and 
f.  The property buyer understands the property buyer will be solely responsible for purchasing flood insurance.

DIVISION 6. - EROSION CONTROL GUIDELINES 
 
Sec. 130-412. - Lands to which this article applies. 
Private property owners, developers, or builders shall be accountable for the movement of soil from their property or construction site which results in accumulation of sediment in dedicated streets, alleys, lakes, ponds, any waterway, or other private properties. Development activities shall comply with erosion control guidelines established within this article, as well as those required by the EPA and TCEQ. At its discretion, the city may review and enforce a SWP3 required by state or federal permit. Any accumulation or deposit of soil material beyond the limits of the property or in city streets, alleys, or drainage facilities in an amount sufficient to constitute a threat to public health, safety, and comfort as determined by the director of engineering shall constitute a nuisance and violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-413. - General guidelines. 
(a)  Erosion and sediment controls must be designed to retain sediment on-site to the extent practicable with consideration for local topography, soil type, and rainfall. 
(b)  Control measures must be properly selected, installed, and maintained according to the manufacturer's or designer's specifications. 
(c)  Controls must be developed to minimize the offsite transport of litter, construction debris, and construction materials. 
(Ord. No. 2014-09-063, § 2, 9-2-2014)  
Sec. 130-414. - Required plans and permit. 
Application of article. All operators of sites with construction activity, including demolition, clearing, grading, excavation, and landfilling activities, shall be responsible for submitting an erosion control plan for approval by the city. This article shall apply regardless of whether a responsible party is required to obtain a permit from the city in order to conduct such land disturbing or construction activity. Each erosion control plan required by this article shall clearly identify all erosion and sediment control measures to be installed and maintained throughout the duration of the project for which that plan is submitted. For residential lots, the standard city erosion control plan found in the residential builder packet shall apply or the builder/contractor may submit an alternative erosion control plan for consideration and possible approval by the city. The responsible party shall install and maintain erosion control devices in accordance with the city approved erosion control plan. 
Concurrently with the approval of a floodplain, building, or development permit by the city and prior to commencement of land disturbing activities, the builder/contractor or other responsible party shall be responsible for obtaining an approved erosion control plan as the city deems appropriate. The approved erosion control plan shall indicate and apply to all areas within the project controlled by, or coming into the control of, the applicant at the time of issuance. The responsible party shall also be held liable for violations of this article committed by third parties engaging in activities related to the responsible party's project. 
(Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 24, 5-2-2017) 
Editor's note Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 24, adopted May 2, 2017, repealed § 130-414 and enacted new § 130-414 as set out herein. Former § 130-414 pertained to required erosion control control guidelines and derived from Ord. No. 2014-09-063, adopted Septermber 2, 2014.  
Sec. 130-415. - Required erosion control deposit. 
Erosion control deposit account. An erosion control deposit shall be posted to ensure implementation and continued maintenance of the city approved erosion control plan. At no time shall the deposit balance fall below an amount as determined from time to time by city council, or the initial deposit amount, whichever is less (the "required minimum balance"). If the fund has less than the required minimum balance, work on the project shall stop until additional funds are deposited to bring the balance above the amount of the required minimum balance as determined from time to time by city council. 
(1)  Erosion control deposit required. Prior to approval of the development permit for nonresidential or multifamily sites greater than one acre in area or residential subdivisions, the responsible party shall pay an erosion control deposit to the city in the amount as determined from time to time by city council. 
(2)  Subdivisions. 
a.  If a developer has more than one subdivision or multiple phases of a subdivision under construction, a single erosion control deposit account equal to the amount due for the largest of the developer's subdivisions or phases will be adequate (except in the case where a lake is situated within the property being developed where the maximum shall be as determined from time to time by city council). 
b.  Subdivisions for which the developer certifies that all houses within the subdivision will be sold at no more than the current housing and urban development home maximum per-unit subsidy for Dallas, Texas, shall be exempt from the initial erosion control deposit requirement. The city housing division shall determine whether the subdivision meets these criteria. Upon two or more violations of the erosion control standards of the stormwater ordinance, within an exempted subdivision, the director of engineering may, at his discretion, require the erosion control deposit to be paid in full, and may withhold inspections or stop work in the exempted subdivision until the erosion control deposit is paid. 
c.  If the developer sells all of the lots in a subdivision to one purchaser, that purchaser becomes the responsible party for the subdivision and is liable for any and all violations of this article and shall post an erosion control deposit as required by this article. The balance remaining in the original developer's account shall be released as provided herein upon the submission of written proof of transfer of all such lots and a new erosion control deposit is submitted by the purchaser. 
(3)  Deductions. 
a.  The city may deduct fees/citations from the responsible party's erosion control deposit account if, after multiple notifications, the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan. 
b.  The city may, at its sole discretion, cause erosion control devices to be installed or repaired, sediment to be removed, or take other actions necessary to correct the problem. Costs for such work, an administration fee, and reinspection fees may be charged against the erosion control deposit account. Stop work orders may be issued until the total amount of all charges are refunded by the responsible party into the erosion control deposit account. A citation may also be issued for each violation in which the city acts to cure the violation. The responsible party shall have the right of appeal as set forth in section 130-418. 
(4)  Refunds. A developer may request the return of the remainder or balance of his deposit by submitting a written request to the director of engineering as follows: 
a.  For single-family residential subdivisions, the request may be submitted after building permits have been issued for 90 percent of the lots within the development and perennial vegetation is fully established along all rights-of-way and common areas. Notwithstanding any partial refund, the developer shall continue to maintain temporary erosion control devices on those remaining lots for which building permits have not been issued and for any other areas upon which permanent erosion control has not been established. 
b.  For multi-family/non-residential subdivisions, the request may be submitted after the project area, including any off-site areas, is fully stabilized, including a perennial vegetative cover, all BMPs are removed, and the NOT has been submitted, if applicable. 
In either case a. or b. above, if the developer fails to request the return of the remainder of his deposit, the city may initiate the refund of the balance to the party making such deposit at the address provided to the city by the developer in the same fashion as a refund requested by the developer. The balance of the deposit remaining in an account after deductions for all violations have been made shall be refunded within 30 days of receipt of the written request. The responsible party shall have the right of appeal as set forth in section 130-418. 
(5)  Charges. Such charges shall be as specified in appendix A of the Code of Ordinances, which fee amount may be amended from time to time by ordinance. 
(6)  Interest. Erosion control deposits posted pursuant to the requirements of this article shall not accrue interest.

Editor's note Ord. No. 2017-05-049, § 24, adopted May 2, 2017, repealed § 130-415 and enacted new § 130-415 as set out herein. Former § 130-415 pertained to plans and permits and derived from Ord. No. 2014-09-063, adopted Septermber 2, 2014.  
Sec. 130-416. - Required erosion control implementation, maintenance, and removal. 
(a)  Erosion control plan implementation and compliance. Each responsible party shall implement and maintain the erosion control measures shown on its approved erosion control plan in order to minimize the erosion and the transport of silt, earth, topsoil, etc., by water runoff or construction activities, beyond the limits of the responsible party's site onto city streets, drainage easements, drainage facilities, storm drains, or other city property prior to beginning any land disturbing activity. Other than for erosion control, no city inspection of any type may be scheduled or approved on a project or portion thereof until a city approved erosion control plan is implemented by the responsible party. 
(b)  Related land areas. The erosion control requirements of this article shall apply to all land areas relating to project construction. This section applies whether or not a building permit is required. 
(c)  Removal of erosion control devices. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy or upon establishing permanent ground cover on a site or lot, all temporary erosion control devices shall be removed and disposed of legally, and notice of termination as applicable shall be submitted to the state and copied to the city. 
(d)  Final acceptance. Developers, builders, or owners of property shall install the applicable landscape plan and all utilities, including franchise utilities, before final acceptance of a subdivision, property and/or structure. Final acceptance will also be contingent upon having permanent stabilization measures initiated (such as required perennial vegetative cover) and all necessary erosion control measures as approved, installed, and maintained to minimize off-site sediment deposition. The owner shall continue to maintain the erosion control measures until permanent stabilization measures are fully established. A site may be accepted, at the discretion of the director of engineering, without erosion control measures, if perennial vegetative cover is established with > 70 percent density and actively growing, and if all conditions of any permits (including 404, SWP3, etc.) have been met prior to acceptance. Any and all off-site areas disturbed during construction must be fully vegetated and established with > 70 percent density and actively growing prior to final acceptance of the project. 
(1)  For subdivisions, the developer shall continue to maintain all temporary erosion control devices until permanent stabilization measures have been established on all those lots within the subdivision for which a building permit has not been issued. 
(2)  For nonresidential or multifamily construction projects requesting phased acceptance, permanent stabilization shall be established prior to the occupancy of the requested phase. Phased occupancy will be allowed only when there are no outstanding erosion control violations for the project for which the request is made. 
(e)  Notice of termination. For all projects, residential or non-residential, the owner shall remove all BMPs and submit a notice of termination (NOT) as applicable to the state and/or federal agency, and copy the city once permanent stabilization is fully established. It shall be a violation to submit an NOT to either the state or federal agency prior to establishment of permanent stabilization and/or removal of BMPs.

Sec. 130-417. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Violations. It shall be an offense for a responsible party or a third party performing work on a project to violate any of the requirements of this article, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Conducting any land disturbing or construction activity without an approved erosion control plan and any state or federal permits for the location where the violation occurred; 
(2)  Failing to install erosion control devices or to maintain erosion control devices throughout the duration of land disturbing activities, in compliance with the approved erosion control plan for the location where the violation occurred; 
(3)  Failing to remove off-site sedimentation that is a direct result of land disturbing activities where such off-site sedimentation results from the failure to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in an approved erosion control plan for the location where the violation occurred; 
(4)  Allowing sediment-laden water resulting from belowground installations to flow from a site without being treated through an erosion control device; or 
(5)  Failing to repair damage to existing erosion control devices, including replacement of existing grass or sod. 
(b)  Notice of violation. Written notice of violation shall be given to the responsible party or his job site representative as identified in the erosion control plan for a site. Such notice shall identify the nature of the alleged violation and the action required to obtain compliance with the intent of the approved erosion control plan. 
(c)  Citation/stop work order. An erosion control inspector shall verify that the erosion control measures are in place prior to and during the permitted activity. If a permittee (which includes the site's owner, his/her contractor, or other agent) does not comply, or is not complying, with any correction notice or erosion control measures, the enforcement process may take the following form in the following order. 
(1)  If a responsible party fails to implement or maintain erosion control devices as specified in the approved erosion control plan, the city shall provide such party with written notice of noncompliance identifying the nature of such noncompliance. The responsible party shall have 24 hours to bring the erosion control devices into compliance with the approved erosion control plan for the site where the violation occurred. 
Modifications to the approved erosion control plan may be required to maintain all sediment on-site. Correction may include any or all of the following: sediment clean-up, erosion control device repair, erosion control device maintenance, and/or installation of additional erosion control devices to prevent reoccurrence of the violation. The 24-hour period may be extended for inclement weather or other factors at the discretion of the director of engineering. 
(2)  At the end of the 24-hour period the city may reinspect the site. If at the time of reinspection the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan a reinspection fee shall be assessed. 
(3)  If an inspector returns to a site for a third or subsequent inspection because erosion control measures have not been brought into compliance, reinspection fees shall be doubled. In addition, a stop work order shall be issued and no department shall proceed with further inspections until the erosion control measures have been brought into compliance. The stop work order may apply to all sites subject to the erosion control permit or may apply to specific sites, at the discretion of the director of engineering. To remove the stop work order the inspection and reinspection fee(s) shall be paid in full and erosion control violations corrected. 
(4)  If at any time the erosion control devices at the site have not been brought into compliance with the approved erosion control plan, the city may avail itself of any or all of the following processes, which processes shall not be exclusive: 
a.  Issue a stop work order; 
b.  Revoke the erosion control permit; or 
c.  Issue a citation for each violation of the city's erosion control requirements. 
(5)  If any soil or material is deposited, by natural event or by an actor, on the right-of-way adjacent to a site or upon any adjacent site, in violation of any provision of this article or of any state statute regulating soil erosion, and the identity of the actor (property owner, builder, permittee, or responsible party) cannot be determined, the owner or person in whose name the permit was issued is presumed to be the person who caused or failed to prevent the deposit of soil or material from a site to the adjacent right-of-way or to an adjacent site. This presumption is rebuttable and shall have the effects and consequences set forth in Texas Penal Code § 2.05, and as it may be amended. The city records relative to the permit are prima facie evidence of the contents of the record. 
(6)  If the erosion control devices have been properly installed and maintained, but the intent of the approved erosion control plan (maintaining sediment on-site) is not met, the responsible party shall take action within 24 hours to control soil eroding from the site and clean up any sediment and shall have five days to submit for review by the engineering department a revised erosion control plan. Work may continue during the review period. Implementation of this new plan will be required within 24 hours of plan approval by the director of engineering. If no plan is submitted within five days, then a construction activities stop work order may be issued until a revised plan is submitted and approved. 
(7)  The city may issue an immediate construction activities stop work order to any applicant, builder, developer, and/or other responsible person or party when the city finds: 
a.  There is an imminent threat to public health or safety or to private property arising out of any action that violates this section; or 
b.  Actions/inactions by a person have contributed to an actual or threatened illicit discharge to the MS4; or 
c.  A person has proceeded with construction activities without an approved erosion control plan or applicable state or federal permits. 
In addition to the issuance of a construction activities stop work order, the city may also direct the applicant, builder, developer, and/or any other person or party responsible for the situation or condition giving rise to the issuance of the stop work order to (a) immediately cease and desist all such acts or omissions and (b) clean up, correct, and/or cure said situation or condition. 
The city may at its discretion issue a fee assessment and/or a class C misdemeanor violation citation for each such violation. Each and every day, or part of a day, that such situation or condition continues to exist without correction shall be deemed to constitute a separate violation for which the stop work order shall remain in full force and effect and for which an additional fee assessments or citations may be issued. 
(d)  Class C misdemeanor. Any person, firm, or corporation performing land disturbing activities and violating any of the provisions or terms of this article and not complying within the time periods stated in this article shall be deemed guilty of a class C misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine not exceeding $500.00 for each offense, and each and every day, such violation shall continue shall be deemed to constitute a separate offense.

Sec. 134-1. - Purpose and intent. 
Regulation of the location, size, placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities in the corporate limits of the city, to encourage the general attractiveness of the community and to protect property values therein. Accordingly, it is the intention of this chapter to establish regulations governing the display of signs and in part to achieve the following: 
(1)  Safety. To promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs: 
a.  Promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals and convenience; 
b.  Do not obstruct firefighting or police surveillance; and 
c.  Do not overload the public's capacity to receive information or increase the probability of traffic congestion and accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision. 
(2)  Communications efficiency. To enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs and thereby encourage increased communication with the public, so that: 
a.  Businesses and services may identify themselves; 
b.  Customers and other persons may locate a business or service; 
c.  Signs are compatible with their surroundings, are appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain, and are expressive of the identity of proprietors and other persons displaying signs; and 
d.  Persons exposed to signs are not overwhelmed by the number of messages presented and are able to exercise freedom of choice to observe or ignore said messages, according to the observer's purpose. 
(3)  Environment quality and preservation. To protect the public welfare and to enhance the appearance and economic value of the landscape by providing that signs: 
a.  Do not interfere with scenic views, and protect and preserve the unique and natural beauty and historic values of the city; 
b.  Do not create a nuisance to persons using the public rights-of-way; 
c.  Do not create a nuisance to the occupancy of adjacent and contiguous property by their brightness, size, height or movement; and 
d.  Are not detrimental to land or property values.

The policy must be carried by an approved insurance company authorized to do business in the state. A bond covering the subject sign will also be acceptable. Proof of liability coverage shall be submitted by means of a certificate. 
(d)  Refusal of permit for failure to pay costs. The inspection department may refuse to issue a permit under this chapter to any person who has refused or failed to pay any costs relating to signs. 
(e)  Approval of permit by electrical inspector. The application for a permit for the erection of a sign in which electrical wiring and connections are to be used shall be approved by the electrical inspector prior to submission of the application to the inspection department for final approval. 
(f)  Permit fee schedule. All attached, detached and nonpremises signs, except those exempted from the provisions of this chapter, shall be charged a permit fee calculated from the sign valuation based on the fee schedule set forth in Appendix A of the Code of Ordinances, which may be amended from time to time by ordinance. 
(g)  Issuance. It shall be the duty of the inspection department, upon the filing of an application for a permit under this chapter, to examine the plans and specifications and other data and the premises upon which the sign is proposed to be erected; and, if it shall appear that the proposed sign is in compliance with all the requirements of this chapter, the building code and all other laws and ordinances of the city, the permit shall then be issued. 
(h)  Time limit for completion of work. If the work authorized by a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter has not been completed within 90 days after the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or the issuance of a sign permit, whichever is later, the permit shall become null and void. 
(i)  Revocation. All rights and privileges acquired under the provisions of this chapter or any amendment hereto are mere licenses, revocable at any time by the city council, and all permits issued hereunder shall contain this provision. 
(j)  Penalty. Any person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter or cause or permit the same to be done in violation of this chapter shall be guilty of a class C misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed the maximum permissible fine allowed by state law. It shall be presumed that a person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity is responsible for the violation if the person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity is: 
(1)  The permit holder for the sign, or 
(2)  The owner, operator, agent, or manager of an entity or business that, or a person who, is promoted by the sign or listed on the sign as responsible for the sign. 
This presumption may be rebutted if the named violator provides the full name, date of birth, physical and mailing address, and telephone number or numbers for the person, firm, corporation, association, or other entity responsible for the violation.

A multiuse sign that identifies a coordinated development site of more than one use, such as a shopping center, office center, or industrial park, may have a sign area not larger than 1.5 times the area allowed for a single-use sign on the site, or a maximum of 200 square feet, whichever is less. A multiuse sign may contain a directory or listing of the occupants within a center or multiuse development. If a directory is utilized, the remainder of the sign area shall contain only the identification of the entire center or entire development. If a multiuse sign area exceeds that allowed for a single use, no detached ground or pole sign is allowed for any single use within the center or development, or for any use listed in a directory on such sign. 
(2)  When determining requirements for allowable detached ground or pole signs under the above table, first determine the right-of-way width adjacent to the subject lot, then determine the lot frontage. Next, determine the maximum square footage per side, setback from adjacent rights-of-way and the maximum height by reading vertically below the applicable lot frontage. To calculate the height of a sign, measurement shall be made from the top of the curb adjacent of the street upon which a sign faces or from the natural ground level, if above curb level, to the top of the sign. Construction of a berm or earthen mound for the purpose of increasing height of signage is prohibited. For the purpose of calculating the distance from a street right-of-way line where the existing street right-of-way width is less than that required in the thoroughfare plan and subdivision ordinance, such distance shall be measured from the line of such right-of-way as required by such plan or ordinance (adding equal amounts to each side of the existing right-of-way) rather than from the existing right-of-way line. Freeways are as proposed by the thoroughfare plan of the city. 
(3)  No such sign shall be erected within 20 feet of the street intersection, unless the bottom of the sign exceeds 42 inches in height above ground level, and the sign is set back from the right-of-way as stated in the table above (reference graphic 6). 
Note See editor's note, ch. 134.

On lots located at the intersection of a major thoroughfare and a freeway, two detached ground or pole signs are permitted, the size to be based on subsection (c)(1) of this section. All detached signs shall have a minimum of 20 feet of separation from the largest permitted sign. 
(5)  If two of the allowable detached signs are combined into one detached sign, then the signage may exceed by 50 percent the total allowable signage of the largest permitted sign up to a maximum of 200 square feet per side.

(2)  It is not the intention of these criteria to discourage innovation. It is entirely conceivable that signage proposals could be made that, while clearly nonconforming to this chapter, and thus not allowable under these criteria, have obvious merit in not only being appropriate to the particular site or location, but also in making a positive contribution to the visual environment. Such proposals will be seriously and fairly considered by the city council.

(2)  Establishment of one or more probation period(s) the aggregate of which shall not exceed 12 months during which the permittee may continue operations under its special use permit for a private club. For overlapping reporting periods or sequential permit years of non-compliance, the probationary period(s) may run concurrently for the purposes of determining compliance for all affected periods. The purpose of the probationary period(s) is to allow the permittee to come into compliance with the requirements that were found to be noncompliant as a result of the public hearing. For any period(s) of probation ordered on or after May 1, 2012, compliance with the gross receipt requirements of Section 138-22(a) shall be established when the permittee shall have achieved the required percentage of food sales for not less than 50 percent of the months contained in the probationary period(s). 
(c)  At the end of the probationary period(s), if same is ordered, an additional audit shall be performed at the permittee's expense. The auditor may be internal (staff member) or external and shall be selected and engaged by the city manager. The purpose of the audit shall be to determine compliance or noncompliance of the permittee during the entire probationary period(s) with all requirements of this article.

(1)  If the order finds compliance, the probationary period(s) shall be ended and the permittee's operations under the special use permit may be continued. 
(2)  If the order finds noncompliance, the permittee shall immediately cease the operation of the private club on the premises. Procedures shall immediately be implemented on behalf of the city to revoke and delete the special use permit for a private club designation from the zoning for the permittee's property. 
(f)  A special use permit for the operation of a private club shall not be issued for a period of one year for an establishment that has had a special use permit revoked pursuant to section 138-22 or section 138-23.

(2)  For zones A and X, or all other areas within the city's corporate limits, in which the proposed well bore is within 775 feet of any type of surface water conveyance, including, but not limited to, creeks, streams, drainage ditches, or other constructed stormwater conveyance systems, calculating distance in a straight line from the conveyance centerline, an approximate flood study shall be prepared by the applicant and approved by the city engineer or designee. Upon completion of the approximate flood study, if the city engineer or designee determines that the proposed well bore is within 100 feet of any type of surface water conveyance, or other flood hazard area, then a detailed flood study shall be prepared by the applicant and approved by the city engineer or designee. All distance measurements shall be consistent with other provisions contained in this article. 
(l)  No oil, gas, or combined well permit shall be issued for any well to be drilled that is in noncompliance with any standard, provision, procedure, and/or recommendation as described in the city's engineering design and construction standards manual. 
(m)  No oil, gas, or combined well permit shall be issued for any well to be drilled on city-owned property without the prior consent of the city council. The city council shall review the insurance and security requirements, potential environmental impacts, and threats to public health and safety, on an individual basis prior to city council issuing the permit.

Sec. 138-470. - Bond, letters of credit, indemnity, insurance. 
(a)  Generally. The operator shall be required to: 
(1)  Comply with the terms and conditions of this article and the permit issued hereunder; 
(2)  Promptly clear drill and operation sites of all litter, trash, waste and other substances used, allowed, or occurring in the operations, and after abandonment or completion grade, level and restore such property to the same surface conditions as nearly as possible as existed before operations; 
(3)  Indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, causes of action, suits and liability of every kind, including all expenses of litigation, court costs, and attorney's fees, for injury to or death of any person or for damage to any property arising out of or in connection with the work done by operator under a permit: 
a.  Where such injuries, death or damages are caused by operator's sole negligence or the joint negligence of operator and any other person or entity; and 
b.  Regardless of whether such injuries, death or damages are caused in whole or in part by the negligence of operator; 
(4)  Promptly pay all fines, penalties and other assessments imposed due to a breach of any terms of the permit; and 
(5)  Promptly restore to its former condition any public property damaged by the oil and gas operation. 
(b)  Bond, irrevocable letter of credit. Prior to the issuance of an oil, gas or combined well permit the operator shall provide the oil and gas inspector with a security instrument in the form of a bond or an irrevocable letter of credit as follows: 
(1)  A bond shall be executed by a reliable bonding or insurance institution authorized to do business in the state, acceptable to the city. The bond shall become effective on or before the date the oil, gas or combined well permit is issued and shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs first. The operator shall be listed as principal and the instrument shall run to the city, as obligee, and shall be conditioned that the operator will comply with the terms and regulations of this article and the city. The original bond shall be submitted to the oil and gas inspector with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary. 
(2)  A letter of credit shall be issued by a reliable bank authorized to do business in the state and shall become effective on or before the date the permit is issued. The letter of credit shall remain in force and effect for at least a period of six months after the expiration of the permit term or until the well is plugged and abandoned and the site is restored, whichever occurs first. The city shall be authorized to draw upon such letter of credit to recover any fines or penalties assessed under this article. Evidence of the execution of a letter of credit shall be submitted to the oil and gas inspector by submitting an original signed letter of credit from the banking institution, with a copy of the same provided to the city secretary. 
(3)  The principal amount of any security instrument shall be $50,000.00 for any single well. If, after completion of a well, the applicant/operator, who initially posted a $50,000.00 bond, has complied with all of the provisions of this article and whose well in the producing stage and all drilling operations have ceased, he may submit a request to the oil and gas inspector to reduce the existing bond to $10,000.00 for the remainder of the time the well produces without reworking. During reworking operations, the amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be maintained at $50,000.00. If at any time after no less than a 15-day written notice to the operator and a public hearing, the city council shall deem any operator's bond or letter of credit to be insufficient, it may require the operator to increase the amount of the bond or letter of credit up to a maximum of $250,000.00 per well. 
(4)  Whenever the oil and gas inspector works director finds that a default has occurred in the performance of any requirement or condition imposed by this article, a written notice shall be given to the operator. Such notice shall specify the work to be done, the estimated cost and the period of time deemed by the oil and gas inspector to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. After receipt of such notice, the operator shall, within the time therein specified, either cause or require the work to be performed, or failing to do so, shall pay over to the city 125 percent of the estimated cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice. In no event, however, shall the cure period be less than 30 days unless the failure presents a risk of imminent destruction of property or injury to persons or unless the failure involves the operator's failure to provide periodic reports as required by this article. The city shall be authorized to draw against any irrevocable letter of credit or bond to recover such amount due from the operator. Upon receipt of such monies, the city shall proceed by such mode as deemed convenient to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred other than for the expenditure of said sum in hand. In the event that the well has not been properly abandoned under the regulations of the commission, such additional money may be demanded from the operator as is necessary to properly plug and abandon the well and restore the drill site in conformity with the regulations of this article. 
(5)  In the event the operator does not cause the work to be performed and fails or refuses to pay over to the city the estimated cost of the work to be done as set forth in the notice, or the issuer of the security instrument refuses to honor any draft by the city against the applicable irrevocable letter of credit or bond, the city may proceed to obtain compliance and abate the default by way of civil action against the operator, or by criminal action against the operator, or by both such methods. 
(6)  When the well covered by said irrevocable letters of credit or bond has been properly abandoned in conformity with all regulations of this article, and in conformity with all regulations of the commission and notice to that effect has been received by the city, or upon receipt of a satisfactory substitute, the irrevocable letter of credit or bond issued in compliance with these regulations shall be terminated and cancelled. 
(c)  Insurance. In addition to the bond or letter of credit required pursuant to this article, the operator shall carry a policy or policies of insurance issued by an insurance company or companies authorized to do business in the state. In the event such insurance policy or policies are cancelled, the permit shall be suspended on such date of cancellation and the operator's right to operate under such permit shall immediately cease until the operator files additional insurance as provided herein.

Sec. 142-2. - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the safe, efficient, and orderly development of the city, and the provision of adequate streets, utilities, services, and facilities, all in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the city. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-3. - Authority. 
These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority of V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 212, which chapter is hereby made a part of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-4. - Jurisdiction. 
(a)  These regulations shall govern any and every person, firm, corporation, or organization owning any tract of land within the corporate limits of the city and the extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) who may hereafter divide the same into two or more parts for the purpose of laying out any subdivision of any tract of land or any addition to said city or ETJ, or for laying out suburban lots or building lots, or any lots, and street, alleys, public infrastructure, or parks or other portions intended for public use, or the use of purchasers or owners of lots fronting thereon or adjacent thereto. These regulations shall also govern any and every person, firm, corporation, or organization constructing any public infrastructure, street, right-of-way improvement or any related roadway improvement, whether or not a subdivision as defined herein is being created. 
(b)  By the authority of the Municipal Annexation Act, 1963, V.T.C.A., Local Government Code chs. 42, 43 and V.T.C.A., Local Government Code ch. 212, which are hereby made a part of these regulations, these regulations shall be extended to and shall apply to all of the area outside of the corporate limits of the city, but within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city. Such jurisdiction shall extend into and encompass all those areas not within the jurisdiction of some other municipality, as classified in V.T.C.A., Local Government Code chs. 42, 43 and 212, and extend in all directions from the corporate limits of the city, and all of its extensions.

When building additions, alterations, or repairs within any 12-month period exceed 50 percent of the value of an existing building or structure on previously unplatted property, the land upon which such building or structure is located shall be platted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a building permit may be issued for one single main building on an unplatted plot, tract, or lot that faces upon a dedicated street and which plot, tract, or lot was separately owned in such configuration prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or prior to the annexation of such plot, tract, or lot into the city, whichever is applicable. The single main building being constructed on such an unplatted plot, tract, or lot shall conform to all of the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.

Sec. 142-6. - Improvements required. 
All of the improvements required under these regulations, or improvements specified in the comprehensive plan of the city, or improvements which, in the judgment of the director of engineering, are necessary for the adequate provision of streets, utilities, drainage, services, and facilities to the subdivision and to surrounding areas of the city, shall be constructed at the sole expense of the developer, unless other provisions are approved by the city council. All improvements required by this chapter shall be constructed by the developer and accepted by the director of engineering prior to filing an associated plat with the county, unless otherwise specified in a binding contractual facilities agreement.

Sec. 142-7. - Zoning. 
(a)  If property located within the corporate limits is not zoned as required for the proposed subdivision, permanent zoning shall be requested.

(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2018-12-078 , § 3, 12-4-2018)  
Sec. 142-8. - Variances and appeals. 
(a)  These rules and regulations are the standard requirements of the city. Suspension of any of these rules and regulations may be granted by the city council or, in some circumstances described below, the planning and zoning commission upon a good and sufficient showing by the owner that there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property in question, or that enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will deprive the applicant of a substantial property right, and that such suspension, if granted, will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or property rights in the vicinity. Each and every application for variance shall be decided solely and entirely on its own merits; and the disposition of any prior or pending application for variance shall not be allowed to enter into or affect any decision on the application in question. Pecuniary interests standing alone shall not be justification for the granting of a variance. 
(b)  If the suspension of any of the rules and regulations of this chapter is sought, said variance request will usually and primarily be considered by the city council. In the event, however, that a city council meeting will not occur within the timelines required pursuant to Texas Local Government Code chapter 212, the director of planning shall have the authority to send the variance request to the planning and zoning commission for its approval or disapproval. 
(c)  The property owner or applicant of the tract of land under consideration who is aggrieved by the planning and zoning commission's final disapproval of a plat under Texas Local Government Code § 212.0095 for which plat the planning and zoning commission is the final decision maker may appeal such disapproval to the city council within 21 days of the date that the decision to disapprove was made by the planning and zoning commission. All requests for appeals must be made in writing, identify the specific basis for the appeal, and be submitted to the director of planning. Any appeal to city council under this provision shall not be considered a filing under Texas Local Government Code chapter 212, and thus shall not require council action within 30 days or 15 days, respectively. The director of planning shall prepare a report and place the plat on the agenda for consideration by the city council."

(b)  This agreement shall be based upon the requirements of this chapter, and shall provide the city with specific authority to complete the improvements required in the agreement in the event of default by the subdivider, and to recover the full legal costs of such measures. The city may subordinate its facilities agreement to the prime lender if provided for in said agreement. 
(c)  The facilities agreement shall be a legally binding agreement between the city and the subdivider specifying the individual and joint responsibilities of both the city and the subdivider. Unusual circumstances relating to the subdivision shall be considered in the facilities agreements such that the purpose of this chapter is best served for each particular subdivision. The subdivider shall include in such an agreement a hold harmless and indemnity clause agreeing to hold the city harmless against any claim arising out of the subdivider's subdivision of the property or any actions taken therein. 
(d)  The city delegates to the director of engineering the ability to approve standard facilities agreements. In the event of a disagreement between the subdivider and the director of planning or the director of engineering concerning stipulations of the facilities agreement, the city council shall review said stipulations and make recommendation for resolving the disagreement. 
(e)  The subdivider shall have a continuing responsibility under this facilities agreement after the filing of the record plat, minor plat, minor replat, or final plat with the county until all facilities and improvements required under this facilities agreement have been completed. When the construction of required improvements has proceeded to the point that certain parts of the subdivision are adequately served, the director of engineering may release specified portions of the subdivision for use prior to the completion of all improvements, unless the release of such improvements will jeopardize or hinder the continued construction of required improvements. Any facilities agreement shall remain in force for all portions of the subdivision for which a release has not been executed. 
(f)  The city shall impose a fee for filing facilities agreements with the county. The amount of the filing fee shall be an amount as specified in appendix A of the Code of Ordinances which may be amended from time to time by ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2008-09-093, § 18, 9-16-2008; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, §§ 6, 7, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 142-38. - Permits. 
(a)  Required. A permit shall be obtained from the city before commencing any construction including, but not limited to, grading, paving, utility installation or foundation work. Requirements for permits related to buildings and structures are further defined in chapter 122 of the Code of Ordinances. Permits may be issued in phases or groups depending on the applicant's development needs. All public improvements required by this chapter must be installed and accepted prior to filing a plat for record, unless otherwise specified in an approved facilities agreement or waived by approval of a variance. 
(b)  Types. 
(1)  Building permit. This permit allows for the installation of all proposed improvements, including but not limited to grading, utility installation, paving, and vertical construction. This permit is further referenced in chapter 122 of the Code of Ordinances. This permit is often the final permit to be issued in the development process. 
(2)  Development permit. This permit allows for the installation of on-site and off-site public improvements. This permit is typically issued after a grading and erosion control permit and before a utility, paving, and/or foundation permit. This permit is typically issued to allow for the construction of required public improvements. 
(3)  Grading and erosion control permit. This permit allows the applicant to install erosion control measures and begin the earth-disturbing activities associated with the development of the subject property. This permit is often the first permit to be issued in the development process. 
(4)  Utility, paving, and/or foundation permit. This permit allows for the installation of on-site utilities, paving and building foundations. This permit may be issued as a single permit or may be issued individually depending on the applicant's development needs. 
(c)  Expiration. All permits referenced herein shall expire two years after issuance. If construction has not been completed within the allotted two years, another permit shall be required and the required fees associated therewith shall be paid. If this provision conflicts with an expiration provision contained in another chapter, the more restrictive provision shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2010-12-053, § 3, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, § 8, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 142-39. - Pro rata payments. 
(a)  The developer shall be fully responsible for the construction of utilities necessary for the subdivision and the surrounding area, unless other provisions are approved by the city council. Provisions for reimbursement of costs required by the city but exceeding those necessary to serve the subdivision, and any other provisions, shall be made a part of a facilities agreement. For any subsequent subdivision utilizing such facilities, any costs due prior developers shall be prorated by the use the new subdivision bears to the amount due. Such prorated amounts will be made a part of any subsequent facilities agreement, collected by the city, and repaid to the original developer making such improvements. 
(b)  All such reimbursements or prorations shall be based on the actual cost of the improvements at the time of their construction, subject to comparison with other current unit and/or project costs. The original developer shall therefore provide the city with acceptable documentation of actual construction costs from which calculation of reimbursable amounts will be made for inclusion in a facilities agreement. 
(c)  In the case that the subdivision shall utilize utilities already constructed through the use of city funds, the developer shall pay to the city for the use of such facilities an amount equal to that which would be required to serve the subdivision under the requirements of this chapter, based upon policies developed and approved by the city council. 
(d)  Any rebates or other payments to the developer by the city for the cost of oversized improvements or off-site improvements required as a part of the subdivision or development and necessary for the adequate and efficient development of surrounding areas of the city, shall be paid only from monies received by the city from the subdividing or development of surrounding areas, and such rebates or payments shall not be made until such monies are received by the city, unless other provisions are approved by the city council. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjacent owner shall pay 100 percent of the costs incurred by the developer to acquire an easement from the adjacent owner. The pro rata share paid by the adjacent owner to the city will be forwarded to the developer within 60 days of receipt by the city. All pro rata payments levied are a personal liability and charge against the real and true owners of the premises described, notwithstanding such owners may not be named, or may be incorrectly named. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-40. - City participation. 
(a)  The city may participate with the developer on major items of construction such as lift stations, bridges or streets adjacent to the subdivision, which benefit existing or future development in addition to that being subdivided. The city shall participate in the street construction within and adjacent to new subdivisions on the following basis: 
(1)  All streets not exceeding 45 feet from curb back to curb back shall be paid for and constructed by the developer. 
(2)  If the developer's property abuts only one side of a street right-of-way, the developer shall provide not less than two travel lanes of paved width, including on-street bicycle facilities if applicable. 
(3)  Streets in excess of 45 feet in width shall be provided by the developer in accordance with the city's transportation plan, or on request of the city council, but the city shall pay the cost of developing the width of the street in excess of 45 feet, excluding the cost of curbs or turning lanes. 
(b)  The construction of certain facilities required by the provisions of this chapter may not be possible or practical at the time the developer prepares their plans for public improvements. Such deletion or delay of improvements may be specified in a facilities agreement, together with provisions for escrow deposits or future payments by the city and/or developer. The city shall not be responsible for payment until the street is extended into or through property other than that being subdivided, and/or until funds are available, unless otherwise provided in the facilities agreement for the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, §§ 9, 10, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 142-41. - Floodplains. 
(a)  Prior to the clearing, grading, filling, dredging, or other improvement within a designated floodplain, a permit shall be issued as provided herein. Plans accompanying such permit shall be certified by a professional engineer competent to make certification that such improvements shall not increase the elevation of the 100-year floodplain, as described in chapter 130, article IV, storm water management. A determination of other possible adverse environmental effects on adjacent properties will also be made by the director of engineering in approving or disapproving such permit. 
(b)  Upon, and as a condition for approval of the permit, all lands remaining within the 100-year floodplain shall be dedicated as an easement; unless designated as open space under terms and conditions approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, § 11, 4-3-2018)

As such, in accordance with the Texas Transportation Code § 311.007, the city may choose to vacate, abandon, or close a street or alley, on its own accord or upon receipt of a petition from all owners of property adjacent to, abutting or directly served by the right-of-way sought to be closed and/or abandoned. 
(b)  Public hearing and public notice. Prior to the vacation of a public street or alley right-of-way, a public hearing shall be held at a city council meeting. Written notice for the public hearing shall be sent to all owners of property, or to the person rendering the same for city taxes, located within 200 feet of the right-of-way in question, not less than ten days before such hearing is held. Such notice shall be served by using the most recently approved municipal tax roll, and depositing the notice, properly addressed and postage paid, in the United States mail. Notice of the public hearing shall also be given by publication one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, stating the time and place of such hearing, which time shall not be earlier than 15 days from the first date of publication. 
(c)  Easements. The applicant for a right-of-way vacation or alley abandonment shall verify with the appropriate entity that the right-of-way to be vacated is free of all public and private utilities including, but not limited to water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electricity, cable television, telephone, and gas. If public or private utilities are present within the right-of-way, a utility easement of an appropriate size and location, as determined by the director of engineering, will be retained. A drainage easement may also be retained over the right-of-way to be vacated, as determined by the director of engineering, to maintain adequate storm water drainage in the area. 
(d)  Ordinance adopted. If the city council chooses to vacate or abandon a portion of the city's right-of-way, an ordinance shall be adopted and said ordinance shall be filed for record with the county clerk. A metes and bounds description and a visual depiction or exhibit showing the location and limits of the vacated right-of-way shall be attached to the adopted ordinance as exhibits. 
(e)  Submittal requirements. If a property owner petitions the city to abandon a certain portion of its right-of-way, the information detailed below shall be submitted to the director of engineering by the property owner. This required information will allow the director of engineering to thoroughly review the property owner's right-of-way vacation request and draft a report of their findings to be submitted to the city council for consideration. 
(1)  An application; 
(2)  The appropriate application fee as specified in Appendix A of the Code of Ordinances, which fee may be amended from time to time by ordinance; 
(3)  A letter of intent detailing the reasons for the requested right-of-way vacation; 
(4)  A right-of-way vacation petition signed by all property owners whose property shares a boundary line with, or is directly served by, the right-of-way in question; 
(5)  An affidavit signed by the applicant identifying all private utilities situated within the right-of-way to be vacated; 
(6)  An exhibit, drawn to a scale of up to 100 feet to the inch, or as determined by the director of planning, showing the location of the right-of-way to be vacated; 
(7)  A metes and bounds description of the right-of-way to be vacated; and 
(8)  Any other relevant information as requested by the director of planning or director of engineering. 
(Ord. No. 2010-12-053, § 10, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, § 18, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 142-81. - Conveyance plat. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of a conveyance plat is to subdivide land and to provide for the recordation of the same, for the purpose of conveying the property to another owner without developing it. A conveyance plat may be used to sell the property or interests therein, but a conveyance plat does not constitute approval of any type of development on the property. A conveyance plat is merely a map of property approved by the city for the purpose of sale or conveyance. A conveyance plat is not the first step in the development of a project as it does not provide any detail regarding a project. As such the submission and approval of a conveyance plat does not vest any rights in the property. No plat shall be considered submitted or filed with the city until it is determined to be administratively complete by the city. 
(b)  Applicability. A conveyance plat may be used in lieu of a record plat to record the subdivision of property with the county clerk in the following instances: 
(1)  To record the remainder of a parent tract that is larger than five acres, and that is created by the record platting of a portion of the parent tract, provided that the remainder has adequate access to an existing public right-of-way via frontage on said right-of-way or via the dedication of access easements; or 
(2)  To record the subdivision of a property into parcels larger than five acres in area, provided that each parcel has adequate access to an existing public right-of-way via frontage on said right-of-way or via the dedication of access easements; or 
(3)  To record the subdivision of a property into parcels, five acres or smaller in area, provided that each parcel has direct access to all required public improvements (water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer) via dedicated easements or direct adjacency to existing infrastructure, no portion of the lot is smaller than 45 feet wide, and each parcel has adequate access to an existing public right-of-way via frontage on said right-of-way or via the dedication of access easements. 
(c)  Approval, variances, expiration, and recording. 
(1)  The conveyance plat shall be delivered to the director of planning who shall check and verify the plat, prepare a report to the planning and zoning commission or city council setting forth the findings of staff, and file the report and the plat with the planning and zoning commission or city council at or before the meeting where the conveyance plat is scheduled for consideration. 
(2)  A conveyance plat will be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved in accordance with the provisions of section 142-89 except as such process is modified herein-below. 
(3)  The approval of a conveyance plat authorizes the conveyance of the parcel(s) created thereon, but does not authorize any type of development on the property. The applicant and future owner(s) of the property remain obligated to comply with all provisions of this chapter upon future development of the property including, but not limited to, all platting requirements, required public improvements, utility extensions, street improvements, right-of-way and easement dedications, and all other applicable requirements of this chapter. 
(4)  The conveyance plat shall be recorded in the map and plat records of the county by the director of planning after the plat has received approval. The director of planning shall provide prints of the conveyance plat to the affected offices as they may require. The conveyance plat shall not be returned or released to the subdivider until it has been recorded as provided above. 
(5)  Approval of a conveyance plat shall be valid for 12 months from the date of approval. If the conveyance plat has not been filed for record within the allotted 12 months, the plat's approval shall terminate and become void. However, the validity of a conveyance plat's approval may be extended once for a period not to exceed six additional months, subject to the approval of the director of planning. 
(6)  A variance to the requirements of this section may be granted by the city council or commission in accordance with the provisions of section 142-8 of this chapter. 
(d)  Special approval standards and requirements. 
(1)  The scale, drawing size, features and certificates to be shown, and all other related information that must be provided on a record plat in accordance with section 142-76 of this chapter, shall be provided on a conveyance plat. All conveyance plats shall also feature the following notations: 
a.  CONVEYANCE PLAT ONLY: NOT FOR DEVELOPMENT; 
b.  The subdivider shall place an owner's dedication certificate in the format approved by the director of engineering on at least one page of the plat; and 
c.  A conveyance plat is a map of property approved by the city for the purpose of sale or conveyance in its entirety or interests thereon defined. Lots created by a conveyance plat may not have all necessary public utilities available for immediate use. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued nor permanent public utility service provided to any lot(s) created by a conveyance plat until all required public improvements have been constructed and accepted and a record plat is filed for record with the county clerk. Selling a portion of property by metes and bounds, except as shown on an approved, filed and accepted conveyance plat, record plat, minor plat or minor replat is a violation of the city's Code of Ordinances and State Law. 
(2)  No permits for development shall be issued nor permanent utility service provided for land that has only been platted via the conveyance plat process. A record plat, minor plat, or minor replat must be approved subsequent to the filing of said conveyance plat prior to the issuance of permits for development. 
(3)  A conveyance plat may be superseded by a revised conveyance plat or a record plat, minor plat, or minor replat, in total or in part, through compliance with the procedures and requirements of this chapter. 
(4)  If a parcel is to be created adjacent to a right-of-way shown on the city's master thoroughfare plan or another existing roadway with insufficient right-of-way based on its classification type, the appropriate amount of right-of-way based on its roadway classification, as defined by the engineering design manual, shall be dedicated to the city via the proposed conveyance plat. 
(5)  If a parcel is to be created adjacent to a hike and bike trail, water line, sewer line or some other public infrastructure as shown by the comprehensive plan, easements of adequate size to accommodate said infrastructure shall be dedicated to the city via the proposed conveyance plat. 
(6)  A conveyance plat is not the first step in the development of a project as it does not provide any detail regarding a project. As such the submission and approval of a conveyance plat does not vest any rights in the property. 
(7)  Any study or analysis detailing drainage, flood, traffic, or other miscellaneous impacts deemed necessary by the director of engineering shall be submitted and approved prior to the submittal of a conveyance plat.

Sec. 142-83. - Payment of fees. 
All application fees as outlined in Appendix A (Schedule of Fees) of the Code of Ordinances, as may be amended from time to time, shall be paid prior to action being taken on the plat application. If any required fees are not paid as specified herein, future development applications for the project or property in question may be refused. 
(Ord. No. 2019-08-060, § 19, 8-20-2019)  
Sec. 142-84. - Incomplete plat application. 
Submitted plat applications not deemed to be administratively complete shall be returned to the applicant without any further action by the city. The fact that a City employee reviewed a plat application to determine whether it is administratively complete shall not be binding on the City as the official acceptance of the application for filing. 
(Ord. No. 2019-08-060, § 19, 8-20-2019)

ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 142-99. - Lots. 
(a)  Lot dimensions shall be determined by the appropriate zoning classification. However, for lots within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, no lot shall be less than 5,000 square feet. 
(b)  For all lots, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Natural areas including creeks, wooded areas and flood plain. 
a.  No property shall be subdivided through record platting or "phasing" in a manner which is intended to avoid or circumvent the developer's obligation to construct public improvements and/or dedicate required easements including, but not limited to, rights-of-ways, erosion hazard setbacks, roads, bridges, trails and parks. 
b.  Minimum usable lot depths for lots backing on natural drainage easements shall not be less than 80 feet measured between front lot line and easement. 
c.  Property located within any flood plain designation (subsequent to any reclamation) or which is subject to, or required to be designated as, an erosion hazard setback easement or another similarly related easement (hereinafter collectively referred to in this section as "no-build areas") shall be designated in a record plat as a common area or included in and platted as a part of a buildable lot. "Buildable lot" shall mean a lot of a size, shape, characteristics and topography which allows for the reasonable construction of improvements and structures allowed in the zoning classification in which it is located. 
d.  A property owners' association shall be established for the supervision, maintenance and restoration of the no-build areas that are included in a conveyance plat or which no-build areas are identified in a preliminary-final plat/replat or record plat of the entire parcel of property (the "parent tract") in accordance with this paragraph. The ownership of any common areas containing such no-build areas shall be conveyed to the property owners' association in fee simple. An irrevocable perpetual easement for the supervision, maintenance and restoration of the no-build areas that are included in and record platted as a part of an otherwise buildable lot shall be conveyed to the property owners' association. The property owners' association shall be formed and established, in accordance with the city's requirements regarding the establishment of property owners' associations for the maintenance of other common areas, at or before the filing of the first record plat of all or a part of the property subject to such preliminary-final plat/replat. The property owners' association shall ultimately be responsible for the supervision, maintenance and restoration of all no-build areas within the property subject to such preliminary-final plat/replat, regardless of whether the no-build area is contained in a common area or on an otherwise buildable lot. 
e.  The record plat for common areas and buildable lots containing no-build areas described in subparagraph (b)(1)c of this section shall be filed of record prior to or concurrent with the filing of record plats or conveyance plats, containing more than 50 percent of the parent tract's developable land area. The "parent tract's developable land area" shall mean that area lying outside of existing flood plains and erosion hazard setbacks or no-build areas. 
(2)  Lot shape. Lots should be rectangular insofar as is practical. Sharp angles between lot lines should be avoided. The ratio of depth to width should not ordinarily exceed 2½ to one. 
(3)  Lot facing. 
a.  Each lot shall be provided with adequate access to an existing or proposed street by frontage on such street, or as provided for by an approved plat reflecting a series of mutual access easements connecting lots with no street frontage to a public street.. 
b.  Wherever feasible, each lot should face the front of a similar lot across the street. In general, an arrangement placing facing lots at right angles to each other should be avoided. 
c.  For all single family and two family (duplex) residential lots, the following shall also apply: 
1.  Lots that front to a street shall only back to an alley. No lot shall front and back to a street. 
2.  Lots shall have frontage on a public street. 
3.  No portion of the lot shall have a width of less than 24 feet. 
(4)  Lot lines. Side lot lines should be perpendicular or radial to street frontage and the following note may be used in lieu of bearings: "All side lot lines are perpendicular or radial to street frontage unless otherwise noted." 
(5)  Lot numbering. All lots are to be numbered consecutively within each block. Lot numbering may be cumulative throughout the subdivision if the numbering continues from block to block in a uniform manner that has been approved on an overall preliminary-final plat or preliminary-final replat. 
(6)  Public improvements. Irrespective of the phasing of development of any parent tract, whether by conveyance plat, record plat or otherwise, all public improvements required to serve the parent tract, or otherwise required by this Code, shall be constructed in conjunction with and as a condition of filing a record plat or conveyance plat with the county when the record plats or conveyance plats submitted to the city for approval contain more than 50 percent of the parent tract's gross developable land area, as defined in this section. In the alternative, the applicant may seek approval of the city manager to enter into a facilities agreement establishing the timing for the construction of such required public improvements and containing such other provisions as may be required by section 142-37 of this Code, as amended.

Sec. 142-106. - Screening and buffering of certain residential lots adjacent to streets. 
(a)  Intent and purpose. The intent of this section is to provide screening and buffering guidelines in residential subdivisions adjacent to public thoroughfares. The intent is to create an aesthetically pleasing corridor which encourages harmony and discourages monotony, while ensuring safety and security and reducing noise and glare in neighborhoods. It is also the intent to encourage screening and buffering at a reasonable (moderate) cost with low to moderate maintenance requirements and to encourage sound planting principals including the use of indigenous plant material with reduced watering requirements. A variety of plant materials shall be provided in order to discourage monotony, subject to review and approval by the landscape administrator. 
(b)  Application. Buffering shall be provided in the form of a common area wherever a residential lot would otherwise back or side to a street and shall be the minimum width indicated in table 1. Within that common area, screening as indicated in table 2 shall be provided. It is not necessary that the back or side of a residential lot physically touch or be immediately adjacent to the public thoroughfare in question or its right-of-way for compliance with this section 142-106 to be required. 
The placement of an alley, parallel road, easement, fence, wall, common area, hardscaping, landscaping, or any other type of improvement, whether individually or in combination, to restrict the visibility of such residential lot and which screening and buffering does not meet the minimum requirements of this section 142-106 shall not circumvent, replace or otherwise satisfy the requirements of this section 142-106. Rather, the rear and/or side of any such residential lot shall be screened and buffered in accordance with the provisions of this section 142-106. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a residential lot (a) that does not physically touch and is not immediately adjacent to a public thoroughfare or its right-of-way and (b) which residential lot is screened by future development or the residential lot is developed in a phase of development of a larger subdivision that has been pre-final platted and is being constructed in phases may be excepted from this requirement by the landscape administrator, in consultation with the director of engineering, if it is determined that the back or side of such residential lot will be screened from view by the development of a future phase of the larger pre-final platted subdivision of which the subject residential lot is a part.

No improvements, including trees or large shrubs which do not meet the guidelines established by the utility company or the city shall be planted over or under existing utilities. Sidewalk or hike and bike trail locations shall be coordinated with other improvements and shall be shown on the screening and buffering plan. 
(f)  Submittal. Plans for screening and buffering shall be submitted concurrently with the applicant for minor plat, minor replat or record plat approval. Plans will be evaluated by the landscape administrator concurrently with the minor plat, minor replat or record plat consideration. Approval of the screening and buffering plans by the landscape administrator is required prior to the approval of a minor plat, minor replat or record plat. 
(g)  Administration. The developer shall provide three complete sets of plans to the planning department which shall include, but not be limited to, the following information; location of berming, fencing, walls or landscaping; sidewalks; location of the street and property line; location of the screening and buffering area within the open space common area; location of existing and proposed utilities (water, sanitary sewer, electric, cable, gas, etc.); location of existing and proposed easements; construction details of the fencing or walls; specific plant materials being used (including common name, scientific name, quantity, size, spacing); planting details; berm details; and an irrigation plan; and any additional information as requested by the landscape administrator to assist in the complete and thorough review of the proposed plans. Sheet size shall be 24 inches by 36 inches with the scale not to exceed one inch equals 40 feet, or as determined by the landscape administrator. Construction drawings of all improvements shall be approved by the landscape administrator and the chief building official, prior to the installation of any proposed screening and buffering improvements. 
Prior to the filing of the minor plat, minor replat or record plat, a compact disk (CD) with a copy of the as-built plans for the screening and buffering improvements shall be submitted to the engineering department in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format, subject to review and inspection by the landscape administrator. 
(h)  Certificate of acceptance. A certificate of acceptance shall be required prior to filing of a plat with the county clerk. Upon completion of construction of the required screening and buffering improvements, the applicant for a plat shall request an inspection of said improvements from the landscape administrator. If the required screening and buffering is installed per the approved screening and buffering plan, the landscape administrator shall issue a certificate of acceptance. Where installation of landscaping is required to occur during a stage 3 or stage 4 drought situation as determined by the city subject to approval by the landscape administrator, the developer may provide the city with a letter of credit or some financial assurance determined by the landscape administrator equal to the cost of installing the landscaping which will remain in effect until the screening and buffering improvements are installed and accepted by the city. Once stage 3 restrictions are lifted, the landscaping required by the plan must be installed within six months, or the development shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter and no additional building permits or certificates of occupancy will be issued. 
(i)  Maintenance. Maintenance of the screening and buffering requirements mentioned herein shall be established prior to plat approval and shall be clearly outlined as part of the facilities agreement or as a condition of plat approval. A homeowners' association (HOA) shall be responsible for maintenance of all landscaping, buffering, screening, irrigation and associated improvements adjacent to residential subdivisions along public thoroughfares.

Sec. 142-107. - Common areas and homeowners' associations. 
(a)  In the event that common areas are to be a part of a plat, the common areas shall be shown on the record plat along with an adequate form for dedication thereof. This dedication form shall accomplish the following purposes: 
(1)  Save the title to common area properties for the benefit of the homeowners' association; 
(2)  Express a definite undertaking by the developer to convey the common properties to the homeowners' association; and 
(3)  Tie the covenants and homeowners' use provisions to the plat so that collection of fees and denying use is legally supportable. 
(b)  Prior to recording the plat, the developer shall: 
(1)  Create an incorporated nonprofit homeowners' association; and 
(2)  Record covenants that automatically make every lot owner a mandatory member of the association, give the property owner the right to use the common property, and establish their voting rights and their obligations to pay assessments. 
(c)  The homeowners' association's restrictive covenants shall provide for continuous maintenance and control of the common areas by a responsible body, in perpetuity, for the benefit of the homeowners without using public funds. Membership in the homeowners' association shall run with the title to each lot. That is, membership in the homeowners' association is not voluntary and its primary source of operating funds is a periodic assessment levied against each parcel of land within the development under recorded covenants, which shall be incorporated into each deed and which shall run with the land to bind each and every owner of it and which are enforceable as a lien against the land. 
(d)  Maintenance of the screening and buffering requirements mentioned herein shall be established prior to record plat approval and shall be clearly outlined as part of the facilities agreement or as a condition of plat approval. A homeowners association (HOA) shall be responsible for maintenance of all landscaping, buffering, screening, irrigation and associated improvements adjacent to residential subdivisions along public thoroughfares and shall have an HOA fee to be levied against each property owner within the subdivision. The HOA covenants shall include a provision that if the HOA defaults, the city shall have the rights of the association to either file a lien on property within the subdivision or assess property owners within the subdivision. This shall include the open space common area designated for screening and buffering. The developer shall establish the HOA, which meets the approval of the city attorney, prior to the acceptance of all public improvements. An open space common area, corresponding to the width requirements described in Exhibit A, shall be provided for this option. 
(e)  The articles of incorporation of the homeowners association, its bylaws, and the restrictive covenants shall be submitted to the planning department for approval along with the record plat and shall be recorded as a part thereof. 
(f)  In the approval of the above documents, the city shall determine that the proper legal position is ensured and that the proposed homeowners association will function properly both during and after the time in which the developer is active in the subdivision. The city may require the association to provide ongoing reporting of budgetary actions, financial reports, and collection activity on homeowners' assessments. Should the funding of the common areas maintenance not support the level of maintenance required by applicable ordinance, the city may require additional security for the provision of such maintenance.

As a condition to acceptance of the plat or deed by the city, the subdivider shall provide the city with an owner's title policy of insurance in an amount equal to the value of the land conveyed, which amount shall be determined by the city. 
a.  For single family, duplex residential and multi-family developments, the amount of land needed shall be based on one acre per 50 residential dwelling units or a portion thereof. 
b.  If any subdivision or site plan change results in an increase in the number of dwelling units allowed on a platted lot, the developer shall pay the difference as a fee in lieu of land dedicated to be paid prior to the filing of the replat or the issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  Credit for prior dedications. 
a.  Where a gift of land was made prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived by the owner of land required to convey land under the provisions of this article, the former gift of land shall be credited on a per-acre basis toward the required conveyance provided by this article when the Council finds that: 
The gift was made within five years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived; 
The land given was within one-half mile of the new development for which land is required to be conveyed; 
The land given is not being presently used for purposes incompatible with park purposes and is suitable for park purposes; and 
A credit may be given for on-site improvements that are compatible with long range development plans for the proposed park. 
b.  The credit provided for herein shall not be transferable and shall only be given to the donor of the land who is the owner of the property being developed for which a conveyance of land is required by this article, unless said prior conveyances were included as a part of an executed facilities and/or development agreement with the city and the developer. 
(4)  Credit for private recreation facilities. Where private recreation facilities are built for the residents for the subdivision or development, a credit may be granted by the director of parks and recreation. The value of these private recreation facilities shall be determined by the director of parks and recreation but shall not exceed 50 percent credit and shall be consistent with credit guidelines to be promulgated as part of the city comprehensive plan and park master plan. 
(5)  Credit for conveyance of floodplains. In cases where floodplain land or property is proposed to be conveyed to satisfy the parkland requirements, a credit will be given based upon the following formula or ratio: three acres of floodplain shall equal one acre of nonfloodplain land. 
(6)  Location. The land required to be conveyed may be located inside or outside the boundaries of the development, as long as the land is so located and in such proximity to the development so as to serve or benefit persons residing therein, as approved by the director of parks and recreation. 
(b)  Improvements to be made. The person required to convey land shall be responsible for, and pay the costs of, providing convenient access by improved streets, sidewalks and, adequate drainage improvements so that the site is suitable for the purpose intended, and shall provide water, sewer and electrical utilities to the property in accordance with the procedures applicable to other public improvements as specified in the subdivision ordinance of the city. However, the city council may waive, in whole or part, such required improvements where an amount of land in excess of the requirements of this article is conveyed, the value of which is equal to or greater than the cost of the improvements being waived. Such waivers shall be specified on a case-by-case basis in a facilities agreement between the developer and the city for the given subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-158. - Money in lieu of land. 
Where the director of parks and recreation determines that a payment of money in lieu of land shall be made, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Amount required to be paid. Any payment of money required to be paid by this article shall be in an amount equal to the value of the property established by the most recent appraisal of all or part of the property made by the central appraisal district. Periodically the city may have an independent appraisal conducted for a sampling of properties to determine if the appraised value established by the central appraisal district is appropriate. The city council may adjust the amount assessed based on any difference between the value of property established by the central appraisal district and the value of property per the independent appraisal. The adjustment shall be a percentage change to all properties of the values established by the central appraisal district. 
(2)  Time of payment. any payment of money required herein shall be paid as a condition to the approval of any final plat or replat. Payment shall be made prior to the filing of the plat for single family and duplex residential developments and prior to the issuance of a building permit for multi-family developments, unless otherwise stated in a facilities agreement approved by the city. 
(3)  Parkland dedication fund. All cash payments paid to the city in accordance with this article shall be deposited in a separate parkland dedication fund. The city shall account for all such payment with reference to each development for which the payment is made. 
(4)  Use of funds. Any payments made to the parkland dedication fund may be used solely for the acquisition, development, expansion or upgrading of neighborhood or community parks located within the same park district or general area where the proposed development for which payment was made is located. 
(5)  Right to refund. If all or part of the payments made for a development are not expended for the purposes authorized herein within six years of the date that 95 percent of all certificates of occupancy have been issued for the completed development of the property for which the payments were made, the person or entity who made such payments shall be entitled to a refund on all unexpended funds if a request for a refund in writing has been made within one year of entitlement. If no such timely request is made, the right to a refund of the unexpended funds shall be considered waived. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-159. - Penalties, sanctions and redeterminations. 
(a)  Requirements to be satisfied prior to development. It shall be unlawful for any person who is required to convey land, or pay money in lieu of land as required by this article, to begin, or allow any other person or contractor to begin, any construction or improvements on any land within any development to which this article applies until the required conveyance of land or payment of money in lieu of land is made to the city in accordance with this article. 
(b)  Permits and services to be withheld. No building permits shall be issued for, and no permanent utility services shall be provided to, any land within any development to which this article applies until the required conveyance of land or payment of money in lieu of land is made to the city in accordance with this article. 
(c)  Redetermination of requirements for proposed additional dwelling units. After the council has made a determination of the requirements of this article, or after the requirements of this article have been met, based upon the proposed number of residential dwelling units for any land to which this article applies, any person who desires to construct a number of dwelling units in excess of the number of dwelling units for which the requirements of this article were determined or met must submit to the council a revised zoning proposal for additional dwelling units for the development. Once the council has approved a zoning ordinance increasing the number of dwelling units allowed on a platted lot, the developer shall either convey the additional park land through a plat or replat or shall pay a fee in lieu of parkland for the additional dwelling units at the issuance of the building permits. Where a payment of money was originally made to meet the requirements of this article, the person proposing to construct additional dwelling units may be required to convey land for all or part of the development. In such case, after the required conveyance is made, the payments, or portion thereof, previously made, which are satisfied by the dedication of land shall be returned by the city.

ARTICLE VII. - PRIVATE STREET REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 142-190. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  It is the intent of these private street regulations: 
(1)  To allow private street developments to occur within the city on a limited and restrictive basis; 
(2)  To provide for private street developments as one type of residential development mechanism to allow the city to continue to be competitive in the development market; and 
(3)  To provide a broader variety of residential areas to meet the needs of the residents of the city. 
(b)  There shall be no required minimum or maximum acreage size and/or number of lots within private street developments. However, minimums and maximums will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis through the specific use permit process. 
(c)  The location of each private street development will be subject to the approval of the city council, through the specific use permit process, on a case-by-case basis, based on, among other matters, the criteria described in this article. An applicant who meets the stated criteria will not be entitled to the specific use permit as a matter of right, but shall only obtain approval for the specific use permit at the sole discretion of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-191. - Administrative procedure. 
In order to qualify for consideration of a specific use permit for private streets, the applicant must satisfy the criteria set forth below. 
(1)  Zoning ordinance. All applications for private street developments shall be processed through the specific use permit or planned development district procedure as specified herein and as stated within chapter 146 and as such chapter may be hereafter amended. 
(2)  Subdivision ordinance. All applications for private street development shall also be processed through this chapter, and as such chapter may be hereafter amended. 
(3)  Board of adjustment. Denial of approval of any private street development specific use permit by the city council shall be final and shall not be appealable to the zoning board of adjustment. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008)  
Sec. 142-192. - Guidelines for development. 
The proposed development shall be evaluated with respect to the following guidelines as part of the review and approval process for all private street developments. Subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section are mandatory and are requirements for all private street developments. Subsections (4) through (7) of this section, while they are recommended guidelines, the degree to which each is satisfied should be reviewed by staff, the planning and zoning commission, and city council, as a part of the determination of the merits of any individual proposed private street development. 
(1)  The area shall be within the corporate limits of the city. 
(2)  The development plan shall not impede the current or future street circulation needs of the area, especially any needed collector or arterial street route, or adequate access to any adjoining tract. 
(3)  Area shall not disrupt an existing or proposed city public pedestrian pathway, hike and bike trail or park. 
(4)  If the area is intended for residential use (may be an existing or proposed residential development), it should be zoned solely as a residential zoning district (that is, a zoning district the stated purpose of which is to provide for primarily residential uses), except in the case of a PD (planned development) zoning district, in which case the area should be designated solely for residential use. 
(5)  The area should be bounded on all sides by natural barriers, manmade barriers such as a greenbelt, hike and bike trail, golf course or park, screening walls, or collector roadways. 
(6)  Except where substantial existing natural or manmade barriers would render the requirement unreasonable, each such development should have direct access to a two-lane collector street (C2U - 37-foot pavement width, unless a lesser width two-lane collector is determined adequate by the director of engineering due to an absence of need for on-street parking), in addition to any access to one or more arterial streets that may be proposed. Any private street development of such limited size that it does not require direct collector street access for appropriate traffic service may instead have access to a collector street within the neighborhood by way of another local street. 
(7)  The proposed private street subdivision should not result in an overconcentration of such developments, to the extent of dominating the neighborhood development pattern. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, § 28, 4-3-2018)  
Sec. 142-193. - General requirements. 
(a)  The private street system must comply with the engineering design manual and the standards of this chapter. All references in this chapter to "public right-of-way" shall apply to private street lots. 
(b)  The private street system must provide access for emergency vehicles, public and private utility maintenance and service personnel, the U.S. Postal Service, and government employees in pursuit of their official duties. 
(c)  The type of gate or controlled access mechanism is subject to the approval of the city's fire marshal. 
(d)  If the private street development is designated solely for residential use, the specific use permit shall be subject to termination by the city council through applicable procedures, at such time as the development ceases to be used solely for residential purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2008-08-077, § 1, 8-5-2008; Ord. No. 2018-04-028, § 29, 4-3-2018)

(3)  All security stations, gates, and other structures not consistent with a public street development must be removed. 
(4)  All monies in the reserve fund must be delivered to the city. 
(5)  The subdivision plat shall be submitted to the city as a replat and upon review and approval, shall be filed with the county clerk to dedicate the streets, public utility easements, storm sewer easements and any other public easements to the city. An ordinance converting the private streets to public streets must be approved by the city council prior to the filing of said subdivision plat. 
(6)  The property owners' association documents must be modified and refiled to remove requirements specific to private street subdivisions. 
(b)  Mandatory conversion.

Sec. 146-7. - Zoning district map. 
(a)  The city shall establish and maintain a zoning district map on which each property's zoning designation and zoning boundary is recorded and said zoning district map shall be updated by the city from time to time as changes in any property's zoning are made. This zoning district map, which may be represented using geographic information systems (GIS), shall be designated as the official zoning district map of the city. The official zoning district map is made a part of and incorporated into this chapter by reference for all purposes allowed by law. 
(b)  In case of any question involving a district designation within the city, the updated copy of the official zoning district map on file in the office of the director of planning shall be presumed correct. Any person challenging the accuracy of the updated copy of the official zoning district map shall have the burden of presenting the official zoning map together with the ordinances the challenging party asserts were omitted or inaccurately recorded in amending the map to prove the inaccuracy of the updated copy. 
(Code 1982, § 41-7; Ord. No. 1270, § 1.07, 12-15-1981; Ord. No. 2002-08-084, § I.3, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2008-07-066, § 1, 7-14-2008; Ord. No. 2019-08-061, § 1(Exh. A), 8-20-2019; Ord. No. 2019-11-074, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2019)  
Sec. 146-8. - Zoning district boundaries. 
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or highways, street lines or highway right-of-way lines, such centerlines, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
(2)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
(3)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following or parallel to a drainage course or other prominent physical feature, such drainage course, other prominent physical feature or parallel line shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
(4)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines of right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale of said zoning map. 
(5)  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately perpendicular to the centerline or right-of-way lines of streets, highways, or drainage courses, such district boundaries shall be construed to be perpendicular to said street, highways, or drainage courses. 
(6)  If on unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the zoning map shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map. Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action of the city council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacated area and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts. 
(7)  Where the streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys as shown on the zoning map, the streets or alleys on the ground shall control. This provision is not intended to change the boundaries of districts where streets or alleys are relocated, realigned, vacated, or abandoned.

The planning and zoning commission shall be advised by city staff regarding a proposed annexation, and it may at the same time hold a hearing upon the permanent zoning that is to be given to the area or tract to be annexed, and make a recommendation to the city council so that the city council may act on the matter of annexation and permanent zoning at the same time. 
(b)  The procedure for establishing permanent zoning on annexed territory shall conform to the procedure established by law for the adoption of original zoning regulations. 
(Code 1982, § 41-31; Ord. No. 1270, § 2.01, 12-15-1981; Ord. No. 2002-08-084, § I.6, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2008-07-066, § 1, 7-14-2008; Ord. No. 2019-08-061, § 1(Exh. A), 8-20-2019)

Sec. 146-39. - Creation of building site. 
A permit for the construction of a building or buildings upon any tract or plot shall be issued only if a building site, building tract or building lot has been created in compliance with one of the following:

(2)  The site plot or tract is all or part of a site plan in a planned development district that has been officially approved by the city council after recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, which site plan provides for all public improvements necessary to meet the normal requirements for platting, and all easements, alleys, and streets have been required and properly dedicated; 
(3)  The plot, tract, or lot faces upon a dedicated street and was separately owned prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, or prior to annexation of the property into the city, whichever is applicable; however, only one building permit for a single main building conforming to all the requirements of this chapter may be issued on each such original separately owned parcel unless either subsection (1) or (2) of this section is complied with; or 
(4)  A permit for the construction of a non-residential building or buildings upon any tract or plot may be issued if a building site, building tract or building lot has been reflected on an approved record plat. A full or temporary certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until said record plat has been filed for record with the county clerk and all other applicable regulations have been appropriately satisfied. 
(Code 1982, § 41-33; Ord. No. 1270, § 2.03, 12-15-1981; Ord. No. 2002-08-084, § I.8, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2008-07-066, § 1, 7-14-2008; Ord. No. 2011-04-026, § 3, 4-19-2011; Ord. No. 2019-08-061, § 1(Exh. A), 8-20-2019)  
Sec. 146-40. - Nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the declared purpose of this section that nonconforming uses be eliminated and be required to comply with the regulations of the zoning ordinance of the city, having due regard for the property rights of the persons affected, the public welfare, and the character of the surrounding area. This section also establishes certain regulations respecting private property rights for the allowance and alteration of uses, lots, and/or structures that do not conform to currently applicable regulations, but which have been in continuous use and were in conformance with the regulations in place at the time of their inception and have been rendered nonconforming due to a change in the applicable regulations. 
(b)  Nonconforming status. A nonconforming status shall exist under the following provisions of this chapter: 
(1)  When a use, lot, or structure, which does not conform to the current regulations of this chapter, was in existence and lawfully operating prior to April 29, 1968, and has been operating since without discontinuance. 
(2)  When a use, lot, or structure does not conform to the current regulations of this chapter, but was legally established at a prior date when the use, lot, or structure was in conformance with applicable regulations and such use, lot, or structure has been in continuous use or operation since its establishment. 
(3)  When a use, lot, or structure, which does not conform to the current regulations of this chapter, was legally established prior to and in existence at the time of annexation to the city, and has been operating since without discontinuance. 
(c)  Burden to establish legal nonconformity. The burden of demonstrating that any use, lot, or structure is a legal nonconformity as defined by this section shall belong to the owner(s) or the proponent of such purported nonconformity. 
(d)  Continuing lawful use of property and structures. Any nonconforming use, lot, or structure may be continued for definite periods of time as indicated herein-below subject to the board of adjustment's power of amortization: 
(1)  Uses. 
a.  Nonconforming uses may continue to operate indefinitely unless the use ceases to operate for a period longer than 12 months. If a nonconforming use ceases to operate for a period longer than 12 months, the nonconforming use shall be deemed permanently abandoned. The nonconforming use shall not thereafter be renewed or instituted on that property or another property in any district which does not permit the abandoned use, unless otherwise approved by the board of adjustment. For the purposes of this paragraph, the phrase "ceases to operate" shall mean to intentionally terminate operations of the nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use that does not involve a permanent type of structure and which is moved from the property shall be deemed permanently abandoned. 
b.  A nonconforming use may not be replaced by or changed to another nonconforming use. 
c.  The board of adjustment shall have the authority to reinstate the nonconforming status of a use if the board finds there was clear intent not to abandon the use even though the use was discontinued for more than 12 months. The failure of the owner and/or operator to remove on-premise signs related to the nonconforming use shall not be sufficient, as the sole evidence presented by the applicant, to establish a clear intent or an exigent circumstance not to abandon the use. 
(2)  Structures. 
a.  Nonconforming structures may be occupied by conforming uses and may be repaired and maintained to preserve or extend their usability. 
b.  Structures conforming to all currently applicable regulations may be constructed on nonconforming lots provided that all setbacks and yard areas are observed. 
c.  Nonconforming structures may be relocated within the same lot so long as no existing nonconformity is exacerbated. 
(3)  Lots. 
a.  Any nonconforming lot may be replatted so long as the existing nonconformities of the lot are not exacerbated by the replat and the size of the nonconforming lot, including its various dimensional components other than lot coverage, is not reduced. 
b.  Lots containing nonconforming structures may be replatted so long as the nonconformities of the structure are not exacerbated by the replat and the size of the nonconforming lot, including its various dimensional components other than lot coverage, is not reduced. 
(4)  Certain uses and lots in non-residential zoning districts existing on or before May 7, 2019. 
a.  This subsection (d)(4) shall apply only to certain uses and lots in existence on or before May 7, 2019. 
b.  Single-family or two-family residential uses located in non-residential districts may be improved, maintained, or rebuilt. 
c.  Single-family or two-family dwellings may be constructed on any vacant lot(s) located within a residential subdivision for which such vacant lot was originally-platted solely for single-family or two-family dwellings. 
d.  Any limitation on the construction or reconstruction of a single-family or two-family residential use pursuant to subsection (f) of this section 146-40 shall not apply to single-family or two-family residential uses which meet the criteria in subsections (d)(4)a.(d)(4)c., above. 
(e)  Expansion of nonconforming uses or structures. A nonconforming use or structure shall not be expanded or increased, except as follows: 
(1)  A nonconforming use located within a building may be expanded throughout the existing building, provided: 
a.  No alterations to the building are required by ordinance to accommodate the expansion of the nonconforming use; and 
b.  The number of dwelling units in said building is not increased. 
(2)  The minimum single family residential lot width, depth, and/or area for the various residential zoning districts shall be in accordance with their respective district's standards, except that a lot having less width, depth, and/or area than herein required, and which lot was a lot of record prior to the adoption of this chapter, may be used for a single family residential use. 
(3)  In the MTCMcKinney Town Center zoning district, a nonconforming structure may be altered or enlarged, provided that such alteration or enlargement shall neither create any new nonconformity nor shall increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure. An alteration for a non-air-conditioned space (e.g. patio, porch, roof terrace, balcony, arcade) shall be allowed under any circumstance." 
(f)  Destruction of structure by fire, the elements, or other cause. Subject to the provisions of subsection (d)(4) above, if a nonconforming structure is destroyed by fire, the elements, or other cause, it may not be rebuilt except to conform to the provisions of this chapter. A restoration or reconstruction in violation of this subsection immediately terminates the right to occupy the nonconforming structure except as specifically provided otherwise herein-below. 
(1)  Partial destruction. 
a.  In the case of partial destruction of a nonconforming structure where the damage to the structure represents less than 50 percent of its total appraised value as determined by reference to the Collin Central Appraisal District's valuation of the structure in question for the tax-year of such destruction ("appraisal"), reconstruction will be permitted to restore the nonconforming structure to its previously existing condition. 
b.  The nonconforming structure may only be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same, but not greater, height, shape, and floor area that it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction. In addition, a nonconforming structure that is located in a historically significant area or which is a significantly important building may also only be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same appearance that it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction. The chief building official shall estimate the height, shape, floor area, and when applicable the appearance of the structure immediately prior to the damage or destruction, and shall consult with the property owner, if necessary, to make a determination. Should the property owner not agree with the determination of the chief building official, the property owner may appeal the determination of the chief building official to the board of adjustment, in accordance with this chapter. 
(2)  Total destruction. 
a.  If a nonconforming structure is totally destroyed by fire, the elements, or other cause, it may not be rebuilt unless it adheres to all then applicable regulations. Total destruction for the purposes of this section shall mean destruction of 50 percent or more of the structure's total appraised value as determined by reference to the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal. 
(3)  Multi-family residential destruction. In the case of the destruction of a multi-family residential structure or development that is nonconforming due to the adoption of Ordinance 2010-05-011 (adopted on May, 17, 2010), the following shall apply: 
a.  The nonconforming structure(s) may be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same, but not greater, height, shape, and floor area than it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction if the damage to the structure(s) represents less than 50 percent of its appraised value, as determined by reference to the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal. In addition, a nonconforming structure that is located in a historically significant area or which is a significantly important building may also only be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same appearance that it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction if the damage to the structure(s) represents less than 50 percent of its appraised value, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal. 
b.  The nonconforming structure(s) may be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same, but not greater, height, shape, and floor area than it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction if the damage to the structure(s) equals or exceeds 50 percent of its appraised value, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal, but the damage to the structure(s) represents less than 50 percent of the appraised value of the overall development, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal. In addition, a nonconforming structure that is located in a historically significant area or which is a significantly important building may also only be restored or reconstructed so as to have the same appearance that it had immediately prior to the damage or destruction if the damage to the structure(s) equals or exceeds 50 percent of its appraised value, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal, but the damage to the structure(s) represents less than 50 percent of the appraised value of the overall development, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal. 
c.  The nonconforming structure(s) must be rebuilt to all currently applicable regulations if the damage to the structure(s) equals or exceeds 50 percent of its appraised value, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal, and the damage to the structure(s) equals or exceeds 50 percent of the appraised value of the overall development, as determined by the Collin Central Appraisal District's Appraisal. 
d.  The chief building official shall estimate the height, shape, and floor area and, when applicable, the appearance of the structure immediately prior to the damage or destruction, and shall consult with the property owner, if necessary, to make a determination. Should the property owner not agree with the determination of the chief building official, the property owner may appeal the determination of the chief building official to the board of adjustment, in accordance with this chapter. 
(g)  Amortization of nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Request to establish compliance date. The city council, by a simple majority vote, may request that the board of adjustment consider establishing a compliance date for a nonconforming use. Upon receiving such a request, the board shall hold a public hearing to determine whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties or the community welfare. Notice of the public hearing shall be in the manner established in section 146-165(4)b. If, based on the evidence presented at the public hearing, the board determines that continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse impact on nearby properties, it shall call for a second public hearing to establish a compliance date for the nonconforming use. 
(2)  Factors to be considered. The board of adjustment shall consider the following factors when determining whether continued operation of the nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on nearby properties or the community welfare: 
a.  The Comprehensive Plan; 
b.  The character of the surrounding or nearby properties; 
c.  The degree of incompatibility of the use with the zoning district in which it is located; 
d.  The manner in which the nonconforming use is being conducted; 
e.  The hours of operation of the use; 
f.  The extent to which continued operation of the use may threaten public health or safety; 
g.  The environmental impacts of the use's operation, including, but not limited to, the impacts of noise, glare, dust, and odor; 
h.  The extent to which public disturbances and nuisances may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use; 
i.  The extent to which traffic or parking problems may be created or perpetuated by continued operation of the use; and 
j.  Any other factors relevant to the issue of whether continued operation of the use will adversely effect nearby properties. 
(3)  Determination of amortization period. 
a.  If the board of adjustment determines that continued operation of the nonconforming use has an adverse effect on nearby properties or the community welfare, it shall hold a second public hearing, in accordance with the law, to set a compliance date for the nonconforming use under a plan whereby the owner's actual investment in the use before the time that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a definite time period. Notice of the second public hearing shall be in the manner established in section 146-165(4)b. 
b.  The board of adjustment shall request and shall have the authority to require, through the issuance of a subpoena, the owner to produce the financial documentation and records within its possession, custody or control (collectively "documents") relating to the factors listed in subsection (3)e, below. The owner shall provide to the board such documents at least 30 days before the second public hearing. 
c.  The board of adjustment shall also have the authority to request that the owner allow the city and its representatives or experts reasonable access to, upon and about the property on which the nonconforming use in question is situated together with a reasonable amount of time to examine, photograph, videotape and inspect all aspects of the nonconforming use including, but not limited to, the property, structure, fixtures, assets, records, architectural drawings, and all appurtenances thereto relating to the factors listed in subsection (3)e, below (collectively the "physical inspection"). The owner shall cooperate with the city to schedule a date and time period that is acceptable to both the owner and the city to provide the city such reasonable access together with a reasonable amount of time to allow for the physical inspection at least 30 days before the second public hearing. 
d.  If the owner does not provide the board any requested documents or fails to cooperate with the board in allowing the city the ability to perform the physical inspection, the board of adjustment is authorized to make its determination of a compliance date based upon any reasonably available public records, comparisons to physical inspection of one or more other similar uses, as well as public or expert testimony at the hearing. Failure or refusal by owner to provide any requested documents or to provide reasonable accommodation to perform a physical inspection shall not prevent the board of adjustment from setting a compliance date. In addition, owner's failure or refusal to provide any requested documents or to provide reasonable accommodation to perform a physical inspection shall constitute the owner's waiver of any and all rights to challenge the qualifications of any witness providing testimony, opinions or evidence of any kind or nature to the board submitted to the board for its consideration in establishing a compliance date. Owner's failure or refusal to provide any requested documents or to provide reasonable accommodation to perform a physical inspection shall also result in the owner's waiver of any and all rights to challenge any evidence, information, testimony, theories, conclusions, analysis, opinions and results submitted to the board for its consideration in establishing a compliance date. 
e.  The board of adjustment shall provide a compliance date for the nonconforming use under a plan whereby the owner's actual investment in the use before the time that the use became nonconforming can be amortized within a definite time period. The following factors shall be considered by the board in determining a reasonable amortization period: 
i.  The owner's capital investment in structures, fixed equipment, and other assets (excluding inventory and other assets that may be feasibly transferred to another site) on the property before the time the use became nonconforming; 
ii.  Any costs that are directly attributable to the establishment of a compliance date, including demolition expenses, relocation expenses, termination of leases, and discharge of mortgages; 
iii.  Any return on investment since inception of the use, including net income and depreciation; 
iv.  The anticipated annual recovery of investment, including net income and depreciation; and/or 
v.  A reasonable wind-up period for the nonconforming use. 
(4)  Compliance requirement. If the board establishes a compliance date for a nonconforming use, the use must cease operations on that date and it may not operate thereafter unless such operations constitute a conforming use. 
(5)  For the purposes of this section, "owner" means the owner of the nonconforming use at the time of the board of adjustment's determination of a compliance date for the nonconforming use. 
(h)  Decisions that cannot be immediately appealed. 
(1)  A decision by the board of adjustment to establish a compliance date is not a final decision and cannot be immediately appealed. 
(2)  A decision by the board of adjustment that the continuing operation of a nonconforming use will have an adverse effect on neighboring property or the community welfare and a board of adjustment's decision to schedule a second public hearing to establish a compliance date are not final decisions and cannot be immediately appealed. 
(i)  Decision to deny a request for a compliance date. A decision by the board to deny a request to establish a compliance date is final unless appealed to state court within ten calendar days in accordance with Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code. 
(j)  Decision setting a compliance date. A decision by the board of adjustment setting a compliance date is final unless appealed to state court within ten calendar days in accordance with Chapter 211 of the Texas Local Government Code. 
(k)  Setting compliance date by agreement. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city and the owner(s) of such nonconforming use from mutually agreeing upon a compliance date. Any such agreement shall be in writing, approved by the city council and said owner(s), fully executed and attested by all parties, and filed in the real property records of Collin County, Texas. 
(l)  Completion of structures. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the plans, construction, or designated use of a structure for which a building permit has been issued or a site plan approved prior to the effective date of this section, nor shall any changes be required in the plans, construction, or designated use of a structure for which a substantially complete application for a building permit was accepted by the chief building official on or before the effective date of this section, provided that the building permit shall comply with all applicable regulations on the date that the application was filed and the building permit is issued within 30 days of the effective date of these regulations.

No. 2019-11-074, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2019)  
Sec. 146-41. - Specific use permits. 
The city council by an affirmative vote may, after public hearing and proper notice to all parties affected, and after recommendations from the planning and zoning commission that the use is in general conformance with the master plan of the city and containing such requirements and safeguards as are necessary to protect adjoining property, authorize the granting of a specific use permit for those uses indicated by "S" in the schedule of uses to this chapter, according to the following criteria: 
(1)  An application for a specific use permit shall be accompanied by a site plan drawn to scale and showing the general arrangement of the project, together with essential requirements such as off-street parking facilities; size, height, construction materials, and locations of buildings; the uses to be permitted; location and construction of signs; means of ingress and egress to public streets; the type of visual screening such as walls, plantings, and fences; and the relationship of the intended use to all existing properties and land uses in all directions. A specific use permit that will require the construction of a new structure shall be accompanied by said site plan. A site plan may not be required if a specific use permit is applied for that will locate in an existing structure, if the director of planning determines that the existing site adequately addresses the above elements and a site plan is not necessary to evaluate the specific use permit. 
(2)  In recommending that a specific use permit for the premises under consideration be granted, the planning and zoning commission shall determine that such uses are harmonious with and adaptable to building structures and uses of abutting property and other property in the vicinity of the premises under consideration, and shall make recommendations as to requirements for the paving of streets, alleys and sidewalks, means of ingress and egress to public streets, provisions for drainage, adequate off-street parking, protective screening and open space, heights of structures, and whether the building is compatible for the use under consideration. 
(3)  Every specific use permit granted under these provisions shall be considered as an amendment to the zoning chapter and shall remain applicable to the property so long as all conditions imposed at the time of granting said permit continue to be met and no substantive change in the use of the property occurs. In the event the building, premises, or land use under the specific use permit is voluntarily vacated for a period in excess of 180 days, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the original zoning district of such property unless a new and separate specific use permit is granted for continuation of the same. 
(4)  In granting a specific use permit, the city council may impose conditions that shall be complied with by the owner or grantee before a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the chief building official for use of the building on such property pursuant to such specific use permit. Such conditions are not precedent to the granting of a specific use permit, but shall be construed as conditions precedent to the granting of the certificate of occupancy. 
(5)  No specific use permit shall be granted unless the applicant, owner, and grantee of the specific use permit shall be willing to accept and agree to be bound by and comply with the written requirements of the specific use permit, as attached to the site plan drawings and approved by the city council. 
(6)  A building permit shall be applied for and secured within 12 months from the time of granting the specific use permit; provided, however, that the city council may authorize an extension of this time upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, except in the case of a private street development, which shall have no limit regarding the application and securing of a building permit. A specific use permit shall expire 12 months after its approval or extension date if no building permits have been issued for the site, or if a building permit has been issued but has subsequently lapsed. 
(7)  No building, premises, or land used under a specific use permit may be enlarged, modified, structurally altered, or otherwise significantly changed unless a separate specific use permit is granted for such enlargement, modification, structural alterations, or change. 
(8)  The board of adjustment shall not have jurisdiction to hear, review, reverse, or modify any decision, determination, or ruling with respect to the granting, extension, revocation, modification or any other action taken relating to such specific use permit. 
(9)  When the city council authorizes granting of a specific use permit, the official zoning district map shall be amended according to its legend to indicate that the affected area has conditions and limited uses, said amendment to indicate the appropriate zoning district for the approved use and suffixed by an "S" designation. 
(10)  A specific use permit issued by the city shall be transferable from one owner or owners of the subject property to a new owner or occupant of the subject property, and subsection (5) of this section shall be applicable to the new owner or occupant of the property. However, a specific use permit issued for a private club shall not be considered a property right but a personal privilege of the permit holder in accordance with the Alcoholic Beverage Code, and thus shall not be transferable or assignable from one owner or owners of the permitted property to a new owner or occupant of the permitted property. 
(11)  Special specific use permit regulations and considerations are as follows: 
a.  Car wash. In the BN neighborhood business district, a specific use permit may be approved to allow a car wash only in connection with an auto fuel sales facility. The car wash shall be limited to a fully automated facility, which will accommodate only one vehicle at a time. The location and orientation of the facility on the site and the proximity of residentially zoned areas shall be considered, in addition to any other factors deemed appropriate, in determining whether the permit should be approved. 
b.  Service station. In the BN neighborhood business district, motor vehicle fuel sales with facilities to fuel four vehicles at one time is allowed by right and motor vehicle fuel sales with facilities to fuel up to eight vehicles is allowed by right if the gas pumps are located within 350 feet of the intersection of two arterial roadways as shown on the thoroughfare plan. A specific use permit may be approved to allow additional facilities to fuel more than the number of vehicles allowed by right regardless of the location. Additionally, no major automotive repairs, body and fender work or automotive painting may be conducted. All uses and waste materials must be kept within a solid enclosure so that the contents are not visible from the street or other properties, and no stock of goods may be displayed out of doors with the exception of lubricants and additives for frequent sale, and no lighting may be constructed to shine on neighboring properties used for residential purposes. A maximum of two brand identification signs shall be allowed if their only illumination is non-flashing and does not contain a rotating, oscillating or revolving beam or beacon of light. They may be installed at the property line. They shall also conform to chapter 134. In determining whether a specific use permit should be approved to allow this use in a district where such permit would be required, the number of fueling stations, the range of automotive services to be provided and the proximity of residentially zoned areas shall be considered, in addition to any other factors deemed appropriate. 
c.  Private club. In the C planned center district, BG general business district, BC commercial business district, CHD commercial historic district, and PD planned development district, a private club may be approved to allow for social and dining facilities, as well as alcoholic beverage service. Private clubs shall meet the requirements listed under the definition of "private clubs" in section 146-46. 
d.  Bed and breakfast facilities. Bed and breakfast facilities may be approved in all districts specified in the schedule of uses. Bed and breakfast facilities shall develop according to the regulations set out in chapter 138, article IV, of this Code and made a part hereof. 
e.  Private street subdivisions. Private street developments may be approved in all districts specified in the schedule of uses. Private street developments shall develop according to the regulations set out in chapter 142, article VII, and made a part hereof. 
f.  Mini-warehouse uses. In the C planned center district and BG general business district, mini-warehouse facilities shall be allowed with the approval of a specific use permit. All proposed mini-warehouse developments in the C planned center district and BG general business district, shall satisfy the following development standards: 
1.  No overhead bay doors or loading areas shall be visible from an adjacent use or public right-of-way; 
2.  Buildings located within a Historically Significant Area shall be covered with 100 percent masonry materials (brick or stone); 
3.  Proposed mini-warehouse buildings located directly adjacent to residential uses or zones shall be limited to a single story; and 
4.  Proposed mini-warehouse buildings located directly adjacent to single family residential uses or zones shall feature a pitched roof (minimum 4:12 slope). 
In determining whether a specific use permit should be approved to allow this use in a district where such permit would be required, the following factors shall be considered: 
1.  The compatibility of the proposed use with the adjacent uses and other uses in the immediate area; 
2.  The development's proposed location within the city; and 
3.  Any other factors deemed appropriate. 
g.  Other uses. Those uses indicated by "S" in the schedule of uses of this chapter shall require the approval of a specific use permit, and shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.

Sec. 146-42. - Temporary uses. 
The following temporary uses may be allowed under the conditions and for the time specified upon proper application and review by the chief building official: 
(1)  A temporary building may be used as an office incidental to construction work if such building is located upon the same property as the site under construction, does not contain living quarters, and provides only for uses incidental to construction on the premises. Such buildings shall be removed within 30 days following final acceptance of the construction by the city. 
(2)  A temporary facility or a permanent residential structure located on any platted lot in an approved residential subdivision may be used as a construction office, or as a sales office, or for display purposes. No more than one office and no more than four display facilities shall be allowed for any purposes for any subdivision. Such temporary use shall be allowed for a period of one year, with extensions upon application and approval of six months possible, provided construction remains continuous and no more than ten lots remain unsold in the subdivision. However, in no case shall more than four such extensions be granted. 
(3)  Temporary uses of a religious or philanthropic nature by those organizations not normally conducting business for profit may be allowed for the period of their actual duration up to a maximum of 30 days, except that two extensions of up to 30 days may be possible upon application and approval.

Temporary sales of seasonal products may be allowed no more than 120 days, whether consecutive or cumulative, per site. 
(5)  The chief building official, in approving or denying such application shall consider the nature of the use; existing uses in surrounding areas; noise, dust, light, and traffic generated; health and sanitary conditions; and compliance with other regulations of this chapter. The chief building official shall have the right, upon finding that a hazard or nuisance shall exist by continuing such use, to revoke any temporary use at any time or to deny any extension. After which, such temporary use shall immediately cease and all temporary structures shall be removed within ten days of notification of such finding.

Sec. 146-43. - New and unlisted uses. 
It is recognized that new types of land use will develop and forms of land use not anticipated may seek to locate in the city. In order to provide for such changes and contingencies, a determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made as follows: 
(1)  The director of planning shall refer the question of any new or unlisted use to the planning and zoning commission requesting a determination as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. The referral of the use determination question shall be accompanied by a statement of facts listing the nature of the use and whether it involves dwelling activity, sales, processing, type of product, amount or nature of storage, enclosed or open storage, anticipated employment, transportation requirements, the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material and vibration likely to be generated, and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer. 
(2)  The planning and zoning commission shall consider the nature and described performance of the proposed use and its compatibility with the uses permitted in the various districts in order to determine the zoning district or districts within which such use should be permitted. 
(3)  The planning and zoning commission shall transmit its findings and recommendations to the city council as to the classification proposed for any new or unlisted use. The city council shall by resolution approve or deny the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission or make such determination concerning the classification of such use as is determined appropriate based upon its findings.

Sec. 146-95. - MTC - McKinney Town Center district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district is intended to implement the Town Center Study Phase 1 Report and associated illustrative vision (known together as the "Town Center Master Plan") adopted by city council in March 2008. It facilitates pedestrian oriented, mixed-use, urban infill redevelopment in and around the historic core of McKinney, providing shopping, employment, housing, and business and personal services. 
This is achieved by promoting an efficient, compact and walkable development pattern; encouraging pedestrian activity; reducing the reliance on private automobiles; positioning the historic town center as a viable transit-oriented development (TOD); promoting a more functional and attractive community through the use of recognized and time-tested principles of urban design; and allowing developers flexibility in land use and site design. A high level of attention to site and building design is required to promote an attractive and functional town center as envisioned in the master plan. 
The MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district is created to support economic development, sustainable tax base, and job creation/retention by: (a) providing a streamlined and simplified zoning process, (b) establishing adjacency predictability in the built environment, (c) offering flexibility to changing market conditions, (d) reducing risk to private investment/development, (e) synchronizing private investment/development with public capital investment policies, and (f) calibrating zoning regulations with the existing physical context and character of the downtown core area of McKinney. 
(b)  Applicable regulations. The MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district regulations located in appendix G-2 of the zoning regulations of the city ("zoning ordinance") and chapter 146 of the zoning ordinance, as amended, shall enumerate the standards for private land use and development within the MTC - McKinney Town Center with text and graphics including but not limited to definitions, administration, permitted uses, building form and site development standards, building design standards, and open space standards. 
Zoning regulations not specifically addressed in appendix G-2 shall be governed by chapter 146 of the zoning ordinance, as amended, to the extent they are not in conflict with the spirit and intent of the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district's regulations. 
(c)  Areas encompassed. The MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district shall apply to the geographical boundaries as established in the McKinney Town Center regulating plan located in appendix G-1 of the zoning ordinance. 
The regulating plan shall be the official zoning map for the McKinney Town Center and shall establish the development standards for all properties within the MTC - McKinney Town Center including: 
Character districts: The MTC - McKinney Town Center is further distinguished by character districts. A character district is intended to preserve and/or create an urban form that is distinct from other character districts. Each character district shall establish use and building standards including but not limited to building placement, height, parking, service access, and other functional design standards for all properties within that character district. The regulating plan classifies all properties within the town center into one of seven character districts (Historic Core; Downtown Core; Downtown Edge; Transit Village Core; Transit Village Edge; Cotton Mill Core; and Cotton Mill Edge). The different character districts are based on historic and regional architectural traditions and development intended to create a built environment that is consistent with the adopted town center master plan. 
Street designations: The regulating plan shall identify existing streets within the MTC - McKinney Town Center as pedestrian priority "A" streets, pedestrian priority "B" streets, or service streets. In addition, it shall identify the location and the level of pedestrian priority for recommended new streets as well as the location of streets recommended for vacation. 
Special requirement: The regulating plan shall identify the location of required commercial frontage. 
Other: The regulating plan shall identify existing civic building sites and existing civic/open spaces and shall recommend the location of future civic building sites, civic/open spaces, passenger rail station/platform, and vista termini within the MTC - McKinney Town Center.

(3)  For COA applications, the HPO shall approve, approve with conditions or schedule the COA for the next available historic preservation advisory board (HPAB) meeting within 30 days from receipt of the completed application. Should the HPO not take action as described above within the 30-day period, the certificate of appropriateness shall be automatically approved. The HPO may, for any reason, elect to present the COA application to the historic preservation advisory board for approval. 
(4)  If the applicant is not in agreement with the conditions of approval imposed by the HPO, the applicant may, within 21 days of HPO action, request in writing to the director of planning that the COA be reconsidered by the HPAB. 
(5)  The HPO shall not have the authority to disapprove the COA application and shall be required to refer any COA, which he is not able to approve to the historic preservation advisory board for consideration and action. 
(6)  Pursuant to subsection (j)(3) of this section, appeals of the historic preservation advisory board's decision may, within 21 days of receipt of the board's written decision, file a written application with the city council, through the director of planning, for review of the decision and the approval, denial, modification of, or deviation from, the HPO's and/or HPAB's decision. The appeal application shall be set before the city council at the first available city council meeting. The city council's decision shall be final. 
(7)  All decisions of the city shall be in writing. A copy of the decision shall be sent to the applicant and kept on file in the planning department along with the certificate of appropriateness. The decision shall state the reasons for modifying or denying any application. 
(8)  No building permit shall be issued for such proposed work until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the HPO or, upon appeal, to the historic preservation advisory board and/or city council pursuant to subsections (e)(3), (e)(4), (e)(5) and (j)(3) of this section. The certificate of appropriateness required by this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building permit that may be required by another ordinance of the city. 
(f)  Demolition. A permit for the demolition of a historic landmark or property within the historic district, including secondary buildings, shall not be granted by the chief building official without the review of a completed application and issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for demolition by the historic preservation officer.

(1)  Any COA for demolition that requires final consideration by the building and standards commission shall be forwarded to them with the recommendation of the HPO, prior to any action by the commission. 
(2)  The HPO shall not have the authority to disapprove the demolition application and shall be required to refer any demolition which he is not able to approve to the historic preservation advisory board for consideration. The HPO may, for any reason, elect to present the demolition application to the HPAB for consideration. 
(3)  If the applicant is not in agreement with the 90-day delay imposed by the HPO, the applicant may, within 21 days of HPO action, request in writing to the director of planning, that the demolition application be reconsidered by the HPAB. 
(4)  If demolition has been delayed for 90 days, a demolition permit shall not be issued during that 90 days unless the chief building official determines that the property poses a threat to the life and safety of the citizens of the city. In the event that the HPO does not act within 90 days of the receipt of the application, a permit for demolition may be granted. 
(g)  Economic hardship. 
(1)  For deviations. 
a.  If the HPO is not able to issue the certificate of appropriateness on the ground that the proposed work will not comply with the criteria set forth in subsection (d) of this section, and any design guidelines for the property, the applicant shall have the right to seek deviations from the criteria design guidelines from the HPAB on the basis of economic hardship. In order to be entitled to a deviation from the guidelines, the applicant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he will have no reasonable opportunity to recover the cost of the proposed work if he is required to perform the work in accordance with the criteria and design guidelines. 
b.  If the HPAB finds that the applicant would have no reasonable opportunity to recover the cost of the proposed work if performed in accordance with the criteria and the design guidelines, the HPAB shall grant a deviation from the criteria and any applicable design guidelines and may issue a certificate of appropriateness for the required work, with or without conditions. If the HPAB finds that the applicant has failed to satisfy this burden of proof, the certificate of appropriateness will be denied. 
c.  The following factors shall be considered by the HPAB in determining the extent of the deviation granted: 
1.  The cost to perform the work in compliance with the criteria and design guidelines; 
2.  The value of the property; 
3.  The extent to which a deviation is necessary to allow the owner a reasonable opportunity to recover the cost of the work; 
4.  Whether granting the deviation will harm an existing or proposed historic or landmark district or structure or property designated with a high priority rating; and/or 
5.  Whether the proposed work is in harmony with the spirit and purposes of this section. 
(2)  For demolition. An applicant who's certificate of appropriateness for a proposed demolition has been denied by the HPAB may apply for relief on the ground of hardship. In order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: 
a.  The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents the most profitable return possible; 
b.  The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return; 
c.  Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have failed; and/or 
d.  The structure or property is in such a condition as to be irreparably damaged and, as such, poses a nuisance to the surrounding area and is a threat to the health, safety and general welfare of the community. 
(h)  Economic hardship application procedure. 
(1)  After receiving written notification from the city of the denial of a certificate of appropriateness, an applicant may, within ten working days, commence the hardship process, unless the hardship application is filed simultaneously with the application for a certificate of appropriateness. No consideration or action may be taken on the hardship application unless a denial of the certificate of appropriateness has been issued. No building permit or demolition permit shall be issued unless a finding that a hardship exists has been made. 
(2)  The HPAB shall hold a public hearing on the hardship application at which an opportunity will be provided for proponents and opponents of the application to present their views. 
(3)  The HPAB and the HPO, in consultation with local preservation groups and other interested parties, shall explore with the applicant, or his designated representative, alternatives for the performance of the proposed work that will preserve the structure or property to the greatest extent possible, while being economically feasible. 
(4)  If a deviation is granted, the certificate of appropriateness for the proposed work shall state the terms and conditions of the deviation. 
(5)  All deviations shall be in compliance with other city codes and ordinances. 
(6)  All decisions of the city shall be in writing. A copy of the decision shall be sent to the applicant and kept on file in the planning department along with the hardship application. The decision shall state the reasons for granting or denying the hardship application. 
(7)  The hardship determination may be appealed in accordance with subsection (j)(3) of this section. 
(i)  Demolition by neglect. No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as a landmark or included within the historic district shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature which would, in the judgment of the HPO, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of the historic district as a whole or the life and character of the property itself. Examples of such deterioration include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports; 
(2)  Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members; 
(3)  Deterioration of exterior chimneys; 
(4)  Deterioration of crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar; 
(5)  Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or foundations, including broken windows or doors; and 
(6)  Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous condition, which could lead to the claim that demolition is necessary for public safety. 
(j)  Administration. 
(1)  Penalties. Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a violation, and the violator shall be liable for a misdemeanor charge and be subject to a fine not to exceed $200.00; and each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable accordingly. These penal provisions shall not prevent an action on behalf of the city to enjoin any violation of the terms of this section or an action for mandatory injunction to remove any previous violation hereof. 
(2)  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness issued under this section shall conform to any requirements included therein. It shall be the duty of the code enforcement department to inspect periodically any such work to ensure compliance. In the event work is found that is not being performed in accordance with the certificate of appropriateness, the code enforcement department shall issue a stop work order, and all work shall immediately cease. No further work shall be undertaken on the project as long as a stop work order is in effect. The certificate of appropriateness may be reinstated, however, upon assurance that compliance will henceforth exist. 
(3)  Appeals. Any applicant or property owner aggrieved by a decision of the historic preservation officer or historic preservation advisory board relating to economic hardship, demolition, or a certificate of appropriateness may, within 21 days of receipt of the written decision, file a written application with the city council, through the director of planning, for review of the decision and the approval, denial, modification of, or deviation from, the HPO's and/or HPAB's decision. The appeal application shall be set before the city council at the first available city council meeting. The city council's decision shall be final. 
(4)  No vested interest. No developer or property owner shall acquire any vested interest in this section or specific regulations contained herein. This section and regulations may be amended or repealed by the city council in the manner provided by law.

Sec. 146-98. - FP floodplain district (prefix). 
(a)  Purpose. The FP floodplain district designation may be appended to any other district, and is intended to protect the land owner, land user, and the general public against the hazards incurred in the occupancy of land which is subjected to the potential of flooding conditions within the 100-year floodplain of any stream, river, lake, or watercourse. 
(b)  Use regulations. Land, buildings, and premises shall be used only for the following purposes: 
(1)  All general and special agricultural, farming, ranching, stock and poultry raising, dairy, and related uses, so long as same do not cause a hazard to health by reason of unsanitary conditions; and are not offensive by reason of odors, dust, fumes, noise, or vibration; and are not detrimental to the public welfare; and in no case shall poultry or livestock be kept nearer than 100 feet from any property line within or abutting any property zoned for residential purposes; 
(2)  All general and special forestry and mining uses and other related uses so long as same are not offensive by reason of odors, dust, fumes, noise, vibration, unsightly conditions, or despoliation, and are not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare; 
(3)  Public parks, recreation areas, and open spaces; 
(4)  Country clubs or golf courses, including golf driving ranges if allowed within such zoning district; 
(5)  Parking lots and parking areas incidental to any adjacent main use permitted within such zoning district; and 
(6)  All types of public utilities, including those requiring a specific use permit provided under section 146-41. 
(c)  Special conditions. The following special conditions shall apply to uses located in any zoning district to which the FP floodplain district designation has been appended: 
(1)  No building or structure shall be erected in that portion of any district designated with a FP floodplain district prefix until, and unless, such building or structure has been approved by the city engineer, who will ascertain that such building or structure is not subject to damage by flooding and would not constitute an encroachment, hazard or obstacle to, the movement of floodwaters and that such construction would not endanger the value and safety of other property or the public health and welfare. 
(2)  All requirements of chapter 130, article IV providing for flood damage prevention shall be adhered to. 
(3)  Any dump, excavation, storage, filling or mining operation within that portion of a district having a FP floodplain district prefix shall be approved in writing by the city engineer before such operation is begun. 
(4)  An area may be removed from the FP floodplain district prefix designation when by the provision of drainage works, grading, flood protection or specific drainage study, it is determined by the city engineer that the flood hazard has been alleviated. Removal of the FP floodplain district prefix shall be accomplished by resolution of the city council after written notification from the city engineer advising of the removal of the flood hazard. 
(5)  Any land, which may remain within a floodway after the provision of drainage works, grading, flood protection, or specific drainage study shall be dedicated as a drainageway or public open space or for other use as may be approved by city council, in accordance with chapter 142, pertaining to the subdivision regulations of the city. 
(6)  The fact that land is, or is not, within a district having a FP floodplain district prefix shall not be interpreted as assurance that such land or area is, or is not, subject to periodic local flooding. 
(Code 1982, § 41-93; Ord. No. 1270, § 3.21, 12-15-1981; Ord. No. 2002-08-084, § I.32, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2008-07-066, § 1, 7-14-2008; Ord. No. 2019-08-061, § 1(Exh. A), 8-20-2019)  
Sec. 146-99. - REC regional employment center overlay district (suffix). 
(a)  Purpose. The REC regional employment center overlay district is designed to provide design standards for the development of properties north of State Highway 121 between FM 2478 (Custer Road) and U.S. Highway 75 (Central Expressway). State Highway 121 is planned as a future freeway connecting U.S. Highway 75 (Central Expressway) to the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. These standards recognize the significance of State Highway 121 as a proposed freeway and the importance of the Regional Employment Center (REC) as a coherent and largely undeveloped expanse of land, quite unique among all undeveloped properties in the city (see appendix B to this chapter). 
(b)  Areas encompassed. The area encompassed by these standards shall include all those properties that extend generally from the centerline of State Highway 121 northward to FM 720 and including some properties north of FM 720. This district will span from FM 2478 (Custer Road) to U.S. Highway 75 (see appendix B to this chapter). 
(c)  Applicable regulations. All applicable regulations for use, yards, area, lot dimensions, utility placement, urban design and landscaping shall be those specified for each district, including planned development stipulations. Where any of the above conflict with those of the overlay district, the standards in this chapter and the associated "Urban Design Standards for the Regional Employment Center (REC)" shall prevail except for zoning that existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. For such properties, the permitted densities, permitted uses, and general lot development or site plan development standards as set forth in the existing zoning district shall apply. However, all other REC overlay district standards shall apply to such properties. The REC overlay district shall no longer be applicable to properties zoned on or after June 1, 2015. Additionally, zoning or rezoning to this classification will not be permitted after June 1, 2015. 
(d)  General provisions. 
(1)  The minimum size of a development or portion of a development to be used in making calculations to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter is 40 acres, unless a waiver is granted by the director of planning. 
(2)  The maximum size of a development or portion of a development to be used in making calculations to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter is 200 acres. Tracts larger than 200 acres shall be developed as multiple neighborhood developments, each individually subject to all such provisions of this chapter, unless a waiver is granted by the director of planning. 
(e)  Development and/or redevelopment. Development and/or redevelopment shall meet the following landscaping requirements: A landscape plan shall be submitted as per the landscape requirements of section 146-135, and as amended. The landscape plan shall be approved in conjunction with the associated site plan. Landscaping shall be provided in a manner that is in keeping with the spirit of the "Urban Design Standards for the Regional Employment Center Overlay District (as described in Appendix B, Section B2 of this Chapter. 
(Code 1982, § 41-94; Ord. No. 2001-02-016, § 1, 2-6-2001; Ord. No. 2002-08-084, § I.41, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2008-07-066, § 1, 7-14-2008; Ord. No. 2015-05-039, § 1, 5-5-2015; Ord. No. 2019-08-061, § 1(Exh. A), 8-20-2019; Ord. No. 2019-11-074, § 1(Exh. A), 11-5-2019)  
Sec. 146-100. - TMN traditional McKinney neighborhood overlay district (suffix). 
(a)  General purpose and description. The TMN traditional McKinney neighborhood overlay district allows for a modified set of standards of the underlying zoning district for those lots substandard because they may have been in place before zoning was established, or were encroached upon as a result of past or future easement or right-of-way dedication. 
(b)  Applicability. The provisions of the traditional McKinney neighborhood overlay district (TMN) apply only to single family detached residential uses and structures. 
(c)  Boundaries. The TMN overlay district establishes the boundaries of an area within which properties shall be subject to the regulations for this district, in addition to the regulations of the applicable zoning district. (The properties that are to be located within this overlay district are generally located on the south side of U.S. Highway 380, on the east side of Graves Street, and generally extending southward to Industrial Boulevard and eastward to the airport area.) 
(d)  Space limits. The following space limits shall apply to the TMN traditional McKinney neighborhood overlay district: 
(1)  Minimum lot width: 90 percent of width of underlying district. 
(2)  Minimum lot depth: 90 percent of depth of underlying district. 
(3)  Minimum lot area: 80 percent of lot area of underlying district. 
(4)  Minimum front yard: 80 percent of front yard setback of underlying district. 
(5)  Minimum rear yard: 80 percent of rear yard setback of underlying district. 
(6)  Minimum side yard: as defined in underlying district. 
(7)  Minimum side at corner: 80 percent of side at corner setback of underlying district. 
(8)  Maximum lot coverage: 50 percent. 
(Code 1982, § 41-95; Ord. No. 2002-08-084, § I.45, 8-20-2002; Ord. No. 2002-11-109, § 2, 11-19-2002; Ord. No. 2008-07-066, § 1, 7-14-2008; Ord. No. 2019-08-061, § 1(Exh. A), 8-20-2019)  
Sec. 146-101. - CC - Corridor Commercial overlay district (suffix). 
(a)  Purpose. The CC Corridor Commercial overlay district is designed to provide standards for the development of non-residential structures that are generally recognized as needing to be of greater height than non-residential structures are otherwise allowed by the base zoning districts contained within this zoning ordinance. These taller structures will generally be located along and within close proximity to the major regional highways passing through the city: University Drive (U.S. Highway 380); Central Expressway (U.S. Highway 75); and, the Sam Rayburn Tollway (State Highway 121). These CC overlay district standards recognize these major regional highways as an economic development engine that may be utilized to leverage a diverse and sustainable non-residential tax base for the city. 
(b)  Intent. It is not the intent of the CC overlay district to replace the zoning regulations governing the use on any individual parcel of property. Instead, these regulations are meant to supplement the existing zoning district regulations on individual parcels of property within the overlay district. Examples of this intent are provided below: 
(1)  If the existing underlying zoning regulations or existing base zoning district on a particular property (the "governing zoning district") allow a five story building height but the CC overlay district designates the property as only allowing a maximum building height of three stories, a maximum building height of five stories shall be permitted. Conversely, if the governing zoning district allows a three story building height but the CC overlay district designates the property as allowing a maximum building height of five stories, a maximum building height of five stories shall be permitted. More specifically, it is the intent of the CC overlay district that the more permissive provision regarding maximum building height regulations shall be applicable save and except in the areas designated as part of the suburban subzone. 
(2)  If the property is zoned PD Planned Development district and the governing zoning district specifies architectural design regulations, the PD regulations shall be applicable except where they conflict with the architectural design requirements of the CC overlay district. If a conflict between the governing PD zoning district and the provisions of the CC overlay district exist, the provisions of the CC overlay district shall prevail. 
(c)  Areas encompassed. The areas regulated by these standards shall include certain properties generally located within four subzones described as follows: 
(1)  Suburban subzone. This subzone will not allow any increase in the maximum building heights allowed by a specific property's governing zoning district and is intended to protect and maintain the residential character of the area by limiting the allowable building heights to those specified within the property's governing zoning district. 
(2)  Low rise subzone This subzone will generally allow minimal increases in the maximum building heights allowed by a specific property's governing zoning district. 
(3)  Mid rise subzone. This subzone will generally allow moderate increases in the maximum building heights allowed by a specific property's governing zoning district. 
(4)  High rise subzone. This subzone will generally allow substantial increases in the maximum building heights allowed by a specific property's governing zoning district. 
The official boundaries of the CC overlay district and its four subzones shall be as delineated on the official boundary map contained in appendix c, section C-3, of this chapter. 
(d)  Applicable regulations. All development regulations specified by a particular property's governing zoning district, including planned development regulations, shall be applicable, except that in the event a governing zoning district's regulations conflict with the standards of the Corridor Commercial overlay district, the more permissive regulations shall control save and except in the areas designated as part of the suburban subzone. 
(e)  Space limits. 
(1)  Maximum height of non-residential buildings: 
a.  Suburban subzone: The maximum building heights as specified by the property's governing zoning district shall be applicable. More specifically, this overlay district shall not allow any increase in building height beyond the maximum heights as prescribed by the property's governing zoning district. 
b.  Low rise subzone: Three stories. 
c.  Mid rise subzone: Six stories. 
d.  High rise subzone: 12 stories. 
(2)  Minimum non-residential building setbacks: Same as the minimum setbacks required by the governing zoning district regulations. 
(3)  Maximum non-residential lot coverage: Same as the maximum lot coverage required by the governing zoning district regulations, except that there is no maximum lot coverage for buildings four or more stories tall. 
(4)  Maximum non-residential floor area ratio: Same as the maximum floor area ratio required by the governing zoning district regulations, except that there is no maximum floor area ratio for buildings four or more stories tall. 
(f)  Architectural and site standards. All non-residential buildings in non-industrial zoning districts that are four or more stories in height and which are either a Significantly Important Building or are located within Historically Significant Area shall not be required to satisfy the minimum standards for approval as prescribed in section 146-139(f)(7) of this chapter, and shall be approved if all of the following criteria are met: 
(1)  Each elevation of each building shall be finished with masonry as specified herein. Acceptable masonry finishing materials are brick, stone and/or synthetic stone materials including, but not necessarily limited to, slate, flagstone, granite, limestone, and marble. 
a.  Each elevation on buildings four to six stories in height shall be finished with at least 25 percent masonry; 
b.  Each elevation on buildings seven to nine stories in height shall be finished with at least 10 percent masonry; and 
c.  No masonry finishing materials shall be required on buildings over nine stories in height. 
(2)  The balance of any exterior finishing materials shall be masonry, stucco, EIFS, architectural concrete masonry units (CMU), concrete tilt wall construction, architectural metal panels (not including corrugated metal), and/or glass curtain wall systems. 
(3)  The maximum reflectivity of all exterior glass shall be less than or equal to 27 percent. 
(4)  The colors of 100 percent of total exterior building surfaces (exclusive of glass and architectural metal finishing materials) shall be neutrals, creams, or deep, rich, non-reflective natural earth-tone colors (including approved finishing materials). Examples of acceptable colors include, but are not limited to burgundy, forest green, navy blue, eggplant, rust, or ochre. Subtle variations of such colors shall also be permitted.

Sec. 146-129. - Height and area exceptions, and minimum distances between specific uses. 
The following exceptions and special regulations of height and areas of yards and minimum distances between specific uses shall apply in all applicable districts: 
(1)  Height. 
a.  In the districts where the height of buildings is restricted to two or 2½ or three stories, cooling towers, roof gables, chimneys, and vent stacks may extend for an additional height not to exceed 40 feet above the average grade line of the building. Water standpipes and tanks, church steeples, domes, spires, school buildings, and institutional buildings may be erected to exceed three stories in height; provided that one additional foot shall be added to the width and depth of the front, side, and rear yards for each foot that such structures exceed the required height. This provision shall not apply to the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district. 
b.  No structure may be erected to a height in excess of that permitted by the regulations of such airfield zoning ordinance as may exist at the time and whose regulations apply to the area in which the structure is being erected. 
c.  In any district (except the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district) where churches are allowed, the maximum height of the primary church structure may exceed the standard maximum height of the district; provided that: 
1.  The maximum height of the primary church structure shall be 75 feet; 
2.  The standard minimum setback for the district for the church property shall be increased by three feet for each additional one foot of building height in excess of the standard maximum height of the district; 
3.  The minimum setback shall be 50 feet; and

4.  Special lighting or lighting higher than 30 feet may be approved as specifically noted on a site plan. 
5.  In the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district, the maximum height of poles with lights is 20 feet. 
(2)  Front yards. 
a.  Where the frontage on one side of a street between two intersecting streets is divided by two or more zoning districts, the front yard shall comply with the requirements of the most restrictive district for the entire frontage (see appendix E, illustration 9). 
b.  Where a building line has been established by plat or ordinance approved by the planning and zoning commission and the city council prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and such line requires a greater or lesser front yard setback than is prescribed by this chapter for the district in which the building line is located, the required front yard shall comply with the building line so established by the ordinance or plat. 
c.  Where a building line has been established by plat or ordinance approved by the planning and zoning commission and/or the city council after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and such building line requires a greater front yard setback than is prescribed by this chapter for the district in which the building line is located, the required front yard shall comply with the building line so established by the plat or ordinance. 
d.  The front yard shall be measured from the property line to the front face of the building, covered porch, covered terrace, support of a carport, or attached accessory building. Eaves and roof extensions may project into the required front yard for a distance not to exceed four feet and subsurface structures, platforms, or slabs may not project into the front yard to a height greater than 20 inches above the average grade of the yard (see appendix E, illustration 7). 
e.  Where lots have doubled frontage, running through from one street to another, a required front yard shall be provided on both streets unless a rear yard building line for accessory buildings has been established along one frontage on the plat or by ordinance, and identified as such, or a rear line screening area has been identified by a common area or easement, along one frontage on the plat, in which event only one required front yard need be observed (see appendix E, illustration 8). 
f.  Gasoline pump islands and other surface transfer of fuel points, such as fuel storage tank filling points, must be a minimum of ten feet from public rights-of-way lines, a minimum of 50 feet from residentially zoned property lines, and a minimum of ten feet from any other property line.

Open and unenclosed terraces or porches and eave and roof extensions may project into the required front yard for a distance not to exceed four feet, provided, however, that no supporting structure for such extensions may be located within the required front yard (see appendix E, illustration 7). 
i.  Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future widening or opening of a street upon which a lot abuts, then the width of a front, side, or rear yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way line of the street. 
j.  The open space in a required front yard of single family, duplex, or townhome districts shall not be diminished by paving with concrete, asphaltic concrete, or other similar smooth surfacing material, except in compliance with the following conditions: 
1.  Paving will be allowed for: 
(i)  Sidewalks not more than six feet in width; 
(ii)  A driveway to the street not more than 20 feet in width or the width of the garage or carport to which it provides access, whichever is greater; 
(iii)  A loop driveway, from the street and returning to the street or alley, of not more than 20 feet in width; and 
2.  Total pavement area shall not exceed 75 percent of the required front yard. 
k.  Where any legally existing lot or parcel has no access to a public or private street, and where the lot or parcel fronts on an existing alley, a front yard of not less than one-half the required front yard shall be observed. 
(3)  Corner lots. 
a.  On a corner lot used for single family, two family or mobile home dwellings platted after the effective date of Ordinance No. 1270 (December 15, 1981), both street exposures shall be treated as front yards, except where the corner lot is on a block face with no lots fronting on that street. In such cases, the street exposure shall be treated as a side yard; provided that a side yard of not less than 15 feet shall be observed (see appendix E, illustrations 4 and 5). 
b.  Front yards of lots with more than one frontage shall front the same street as the interior lots within the same block. For purposes of this requirement, an interior lot is one, which adjoins a street (public or private) on only one side (see appendix E, illustrations 4 and 5). 
c.  Where none of these conditions establish a specific street frontage as the front of the lot, the property owner, in the initial development of the property, may observe the front yard adjacent to the street frontage of his choosing. Henceforth, the front yard so observed shall not be reduced below the requirements of this chapter. 
(4)  Side yards. 
a.  Every part of the required side yard shall be open and unobstructed except for accessory buildings as permitted herein, and the ordinary projections of window sills, belt courses, and other architectural features projecting not to exceed 12 inches into the required side yard, and roof eaves projecting not to exceed 24 inches into the required side yard. 
b.  Where a future right-of-way line has been established for future widening or opening of a street upon which a lot abuts, then the front, side, or rear yard shall be measured from the future right-of-way line. 
c.  Within all multiple family developments except those in the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district, the following minimum distances between buildings shall be observed: 
Building Orientation 	Minimum Separation 
Front to front 	40' 
Front to rear 	40' 
Rear to rear 	20' 
Side to side 	10' 
Side to front 	20' 
Side to rear 	10' 
 
d.  No complex of attached one-family dwellings shall exceed 200 feet in length (see appendix E, illustration 12). 
(5)  Minimum distances between specific uses. 
a.  No portion of a day care center site may be located within 300 feet of gasoline pumps or any other storage area for explosive materials. 
b.  A private club shall be prohibited within 300 feet of the property line of any church, public or parochial school, hospital, extended care facility, or publicly owned park, except that the prohibition will not apply to property located within 300 feet of publicly owned parks if the city council affirmatively finds that issuance of the specific use permit would not be detrimental or injurious to the public health, safety or general welfare, or otherwise offensive to the neighborhood. The 300-foot distance shall be determined by a measurement on the ground from the front door of the premises to be permitted to the nearest property line of the said church, public or parochial school, hospital, or publicly owned park.

b.  Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be constructed to be the next higher whole number. 
c.  The parking space requirement for a use not specifically mentioned herein shall be the same as required for a use of similar nature. 
d.  Whenever a building or use is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or otherwise, to create a need for an increase in the number of existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever any building is enlarged to the extent of 50 percent or more in floor area or in the area used, said building or use shall then and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth herein. 
e.  In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately. 
f.  Parking reductions. 
1.  For multi-tenant retail shopping centers or office developments greater than 25,000 square feet in floor area, the sum of the total required parking may be reduced with site plan approval. Determination shall be based on the frequency of the anticipated peak parking demands, and location of parking spaces in relation to the building(s). 
2.  For developments greater than 50,000 square feet in floor area, the sum of the total required parking may be reduced with site plan approval. Determination shall be based on the frequency of the anticipated peak parking demands, and location of parking spaces in relation to the building(s). 
3.  The sum of the total required parking for a development may be reduced as indicated by the table below if a quality tree(s) is preserved. 
Size (DBH) of the Preserved Tree 	Reduction in Parking Requirement 
6" to 8" 	2 parking spaces 
9" to 15" 	3 parking spaces 
16" to 30" 	4 parking spaces 
31" to 41" 	5 parking spaces 
 
4.  If one, two, or all of the parking reductions specified above are utilized, the overall parking reduction shall not exceed ten percent of the sum of the total required parking for the development. 
5.  The enclosed parking space requirement for multi-family residential and senior multi-family residential uses may be reduced from no less than 50 percent of the units having an enclosed parking space to no less than 30 percent of the units having an enclosed parking space as part of the site plan approval process. The project is subject to the city council's discretionary approval after consideration by the planning and zoning commission and may be approved if the proposed project satisfies the following: 
i.  The project represents an innovative or exceptional quality design; and 
ii.  The project represents a significant contribution to the existing and future built environment in the area. 
iii.  Reductions in the enclosed parking requirement may not be granted for pecuniary reasons or to serve as a convenience for the development. 
(3)  Shared parking spaces. Under specific circumstances listed below, a limited number of parking spaces may be applied toward parking space requirements for two different uses. Proposed shared parking arrangements shall be considered during the site planning process. Not more than 50 percent of the parking spaces shall be required for: 
a.  Theaters, bowling alleys, nightclubs, church or school auditoriums, or similar uses may be provided and used jointly by; 
b.  Uses not normally open, used or operated during the same hours as those listed in subsection (3)a of this section. 
(4)  Location of parking spaces. All parking spaces required herein shall be located on the same lot with the building or use served, except as follows:

Each additional 200,000 	1 additional 
 
(3)  For multi-tenant retail shopping centers, office or industrial developments greater than 50,000 square feet in floor area, the sum of the total required loading spaces may be reduced with site plan approval. Determination shall be based on the frequency of the anticipated deliveries and the location of the loading spaces in relation to the buildings. 
(4)  Each required loading space shall meet the following minimum size requirements: 
a.  Twelve feet by 60 feet for industrial or warehouse uses. 
b.  Twelve feet by 35 feet for commercial and institutional uses. 
c.  Fourteen feet minimum vertical clearance. 
(5)  Access and maneuvering areas shall be provided on the same building lot as the principal use for which the loading space is intended. 
(6)  All loading spaces shall be located within 25 feet of the building. If unique circumstances exist on the site that prohibit locating the loading space within 25 feet, the distance may be increased with site plan approval as long as the loading space is still considered usable, the location does not have an adverse impact on current or future development, and the location will have no adverse impact on the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(7)  Distance from property lines shall be as follows: 
a.  Any loading dock or structure and its associated loading spaces shall be: 
1.  Set back a minimum distance of 200 feet from any adjacent residential use or zoning district; and 
2.  Set back a minimum distance of 75 feet from any public street or front property line; and 
3.  Oriented away from the street frontage. 
b.  Any loading spaces not associated with a loading dock or structure shall be set back a minimum distance of 50 feet from any adjacent residential use or zoning district, and there shall be no minimum setback if the subject property abuts a non-residential use or lot line. 
c.  In instances where a property has more than one street frontage, the bay doors shall be oriented away from the street frontage with the greatest width. If the streets are the same width, then the bay doors shall be oriented away from the property's front lot line (as defined in section 146-46(66)g.). 
(8)  Loading docks for any establishment, which customarily receives goods between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. and is adjacent to a residential use or districts shall be designed and constructed so as to enclose the loading operation on three sides to reduce noise, with the open end directed away from residential property. 
(9)  If unique site circumstances prevent strict adherence with subsection (5) or (6) of this section, the planning and zoning commission may consider a variance to the provisions of subsections (6) and/or (7) of this section; provided that sufficient screening and buffering is provided to mitigate the impact of the loading areas on surrounding properties. The applicant shall prove that the variance from the zoning regulations is warranted under the circumstances presented. A variance may be granted if the planning and zoning commission and/or city council, depending on which body has the final approval authority as indicated in section 146-45 finds that: 
a.  Unique circumstances exist on the property that make application of subsections (6) and/or (7) of this section unduly burdensome on the applicant; 
b.  The variance will have no adverse impact on current or future development; 
c.  The variance is in keeping with the spirit of the zoning regulations, and will have a minimal impact, if any, on the surrounding land uses; and 
d.  The variance will have no adverse impact on the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
A financial hardship shall not be considered a basis for the granting of a variance.

Sec. 146-135. - Landscape requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. Landscaping is accepted as adding value to property and is in the interest of the general welfare of the city. Therefore, landscaping is hereafter required of new development. 
(b)  Scope and enforcement. 
(1)  The provisions of this section shall be administered by the landscape administrator. The standards and criteria contained within this section are deemed to be minimum standards and shall apply to all new construction or any existing development, which is altered by increasing the floor area by 30 percent or more of the originally approved floor area, either by a single expansion or by the cumulative effect of a series of expansions. 
(2)  All existing structures, which are a conversion or change in use requiring the expansion of or significant improvements to meet parking standards shall upgrade landscaping on the site and meet these requirements to the extent practical. The director of planning or his designee shall have the ability to waive landscape requirements on a case-by-case basis if unique circumstances exist on the property that make application of these regulations unduly burdensome on the applicant. These regulations may be waived only if there will be no adverse impact on current or future development and will have no adverse impact on the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(3)  Uses within the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district shall be exempt from the landscape requirements set forth herein, unless it is determined by the landscape administrator that compliance with any of these standards is achievable and would contribute to the purpose and intent of the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district. See appendix G of the city zoning regulations chapter 146 for any additional landscaping requirements that may be specifically applicable to the MTC - McKinney Town Center zoning district. 
(4)  Airfields (commonly known as the "air side" of an airport's perimeter boundary fence or wall) which accommodate fixed-wing aircrafts on a concrete runway with a length of at least 5,000 feet and allow for the operation of rotary-wing aircrafts shall be exempt from the requirements of section 146-135(f) of this chapter. 
(5)  If at any time after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the approved landscaping is found to be in nonconformance to the standards and criteria as approved on the landscape plan, the chief building official shall issue notice to the owner, citing the violation and describing what action is required to comply with this section. The owner, tenant, and/or agent shall make reasonable progress within 30 days from date of said notice and shall have 90 days to completely restore the landscaping as required. A 30-day extension may be granted by the chief building official if a hardship due to extreme seasonal conditions can be demonstrated by the owner, tenant, and/or agent. If the landscaping is not restored within the allotted time, such person shall be held in violation of this chapter. 
(c)  Permits. 
(1)  No permits shall be issued for building, paving, grading, or construction until a detailed landscape plan is submitted and approved by the landscape administrator. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any building or structure, all screening and landscaping shall be in place in accordance with the landscape plan. 
(2)  If a certificate of occupancy is sought at a season of the year (June, July, and August), or during a stage 3 or stage 4 drought situation, as determined in the sole discretion of the city, and the landscape administrator determines it would be impractical to plant trees, shrubs or grass, or to lay turf, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued. All landscaping required by the landscape plan shall be installed within 120 days of the latter of the date of issuance of the temporary certificate of occupancy or the lifting of the stage 3 drought restrictions. Failure to timely complete the installation and obtain the city's final acceptance of the landscaping required by the landscape plan shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter and the temporary certificate of occupancy shall be revoked. 
(d)  Landscape plan. 
(1)  A landscape plan shall be shown as part of the site plan as required in section 146-45. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, paving, grading, or construction permit for any new use, a landscape plan satisfying the criteria of these regulations any conditions of approval shall be approved by the landscape administrator. The landscape administrator shall review such plans and shall approve the same plans if they are in accordance with the criteria of these regulations and any conditions of approval. If the plans are not in accordance, they shall be disapproved and shall be accompanied by a written statement setting forth the changes necessary for compliance. 
(2)  The landscape plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect, architect or engineer licensed by the State of Texas. For a project of one acre or less a landscape architect, architect or engineer shall not be required. The landscape administrator may approve a landscape plan prepared by a qualified professional if complete and accurate information is provided. The plan shall contain the minimum following information: 
a.  The minimum scale of one inch equals 40 feet or the same scale as the associated site plan; 
b.  The location, size, and species of all trees to be preserved, do not use tree stamps; 
c.

m.  The location of all existing and planned overhead and underground utilities shall be shown on the landscape plan or on an accompanying utility plan drawn at the same scale, if necessary for clarity. 
n.  Additional information as deemed necessary to adequately evaluate the landscape plan. 
(e)  General standards. 
(1)  The following criteria and standards shall apply to landscape materials and installation. For the purposes of this section, the term "caliper" shall be defined as the diameter measurement of a tree trunk. 
a.  Required landscaped open areas shall be completely covered with living plant material. 
b.  Plant materials shall conform to the standards of the approved plant lists for the city (see appendix A to this chapter). Grass seed, sod and other material shall be clean and reasonably free of weeds and noxious pest and insects. 
c.  To promote prudent use of the city's water resources and reduce the need for additional water system infrastructure, additional water resources and water purification systems, and to help ensure viability of required plantings during periods of drought, required landscaping shall comply, where feasible, with the following requirements designed to reduce water usage: 
1.  Required plant materials shall be selected from those identified as drought tolerant plants on the approved plant list for the city (see appendix A, section A-2 to this chapter). 
2.  Where specific conditions reduce the likelihood that any of these plant materials will survive, other plants on the list may be substituted. 
3.  Other plants not on the list may be substituted at the discretion of the landscape administrator. The applicant may be required to provide substantiation as to the hardiness, adaptability, and water demands of the plant when used in this area. 
4.  For maximum reduction in water usage, drought tolerant plants should not be interspersed in plant massings with plants requiring higher water usage. 
5.  Applicants should design irrigation systems and watering schedules which supply the appropriate amount of water without over-watering. 
d.  Ornamental trees shall have a minimum spread of crown of greater than 15 feet at maturity. Ornamental trees having a minimum mature crown of less than 15 feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the equivalent of 15 feet of crown width. Ornamental trees shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper as measured six inches above the ground and eight feet in height at the time of planting. 
e.  Canopy trees shall have a minimum spread of crown of 25 feet at maturity. Canopy trees shall be a minimum of four inches in caliper as measured six inches above the ground and 12 feet in height at the time of planting. 
f.  Shrubs acceptable for six-foot screening shall be a minimum of three feet in height when measured immediately after planting and shall be planted no further apart than three feet on center, unless otherwise approved by the director of planning, and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen which will be six feet high within two years after time of planting. 
g.  Shrubs not of the dwarf variety shall be a minimum of two feet in height when measured immediately after planting. 
h.  Hedges, where installed for buffering purposes required by this section, shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen which will be three feet high within two years after time of planting. 
i.  Landscaping, except required grass and low ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of any parking space. 
j.  Evergreen vines not intended as ground cover shall be a minimum of two feet in height immediately after planting and may be used in conjunction with fences, screens, or walls to meet landscape screening and/or buffering requirements, as set forth herein and as approved by the director of planning. 
k.  Grass areas shall be sodded, plugged, sprigged, hydro-mulched, or seeded, except that solid sod shall be used in swales, or when necessary to prevent erosion. Grass areas shall be established with 100 percent coverage and 70 percent density with an approved perennial grass prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
l.  Ground covers used in-lieu-of grass shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably completed coverage within one year of planting. 
(2)  All required landscape areas shall be provided with an automatic underground irrigation system, except for required landscaping in single family or two-family developments. Any new irrigation system installed on or after September 1, 2007, must be equipped with rain and freeze sensors.

Irrigation systems shall comply with the city's water conservation ordinance as it exists or may be amended. 
(3)  Earthen berms shall have side slopes not to exceed 4:1 (four feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of height). All berms shall contain necessary drainage provisions as may be required by the city engineer. 
(4)  No tree shall be planted closer than four feet to a right-of-way line nor closer than eight feet to a public utility line (water or sewer), unless no other alternative is available. Further, a landscape area in which trees are to be provided shall not conflict with a utility easement, unless no alternative is available. 
(5)  No tree that has a mature height of 25 feet or greater shall be planted beneath an existing or proposed overhead utility line. Where canopy trees are required adjacent to or underneath overhead utility lines, ornamental trees (a minimum of two inches in caliper as measured six inches above the ground) shall be provided instead of the required canopy trees. 
(6)  All landscape areas shall be protected by a monolithic curb or wheel stops and remain free of trash, litter, and car bumper overhangs. 
(f)  Minimum landscaping requirements. 
(1)  For all non-residential and multiple family parcels, at least 15 percent of the street yard shall be permanent landscape area. The term "street yard" shall be defined as the area between the front property line and the minimum front set back line. 
(2)  For all non-residential and multiple family parcels located at the intersection of two dedicated public streets (rights-of-way), a 30-foot landscape buffer shall be provided parallel to the corner clip right-of-way dedication, which can be counted toward the 15 percent requirement. See appendix E, illustration 19, for intersection landscaping. 
(3)  For all non-residential and multiple family parcels, a minimum of 10 percent of the entire site shall be devoted to living landscape, which shall include grass, ground cover, plants, shrubs, or trees. 
(4)  Landscape setbacks on thoroughfares shall comply with the following provisions: 
a.  Landscape setbacks on minor thoroughfares. For all non-residential and multiple family parcels, a minimum ten-foot landscape buffer adjacent to the right-of-way of any minor thoroughfare is required. If the lot is a corner lot, all frontages shall be required to observe the ten-foot buffer. 
b.  Landscape setbacks on major thoroughfares. For non-residential and multiple family parcels, a minimum 20-foot landscape buffer adjacent to the right-of-way of any major thoroughfare is required. If the lot is a corner lot, all frontages shall be required to observe the 20-foot buffer. 
c.  Landscape setback variances. If unique circumstances exist which prevent strict adherence with this requirement, the planning and zoning commission may consider a granting of a variance during the site plan approval process to reduce the minimum 20-foot landscape buffer to a minimum of ten feet; provided that site design considerations have been incorporated to mitigate the impact of the variance. Unusual circumstances include, but are not limited to: insufficient lot depth or size of the existing lot, existing structures and drives, and floodplain and existing trees to be preserved. A variance may be granted if: 
1.  Unique circumstances exist on the property that makes application of this section unduly burdensome on the applicant; 
2.  The variance will have no adverse impact on current or future development; 
3.  The variance is in keeping with the spirit of the zoning regulations, and will have a minimal impact, if any, on the surrounding land uses; and 
4.  The variance will have no adverse impact on the public health, safety and general welfare. 
A financial hardship shall not be considered a basis for the granting of a variance. 
(5)  For all non-residential and multiple family parcels, developers shall be required to plant one canopy tree per 40 linear feet, or portion thereof, of street frontage. These required trees must be planted within the associated landscape setback along thoroughfares, unless otherwise approved by the director of planning. Trees may be grouped or clustered to facilitate site design.

c.  A maximum of 50 percent of the parking island covered with bark mulch or decomposed granite material. 
(11)  All existing trees that are to be considered for credit shall be provided with a permeable surface (a surface that does not impede the absorption of water) within a minimum five-foot radius from the trunk of the tree. All new trees shall be provided with a permeable surface within a minimum 2½-foot radius from the trunk of the tree. 
(12)  At least 75 percent of the frontage of parking lots, adjacent to a public right-of-way, within the street yard shall be screened from public streets with evergreen shrubs attaining a minimum height of three feet, an earthen berm of a minimum height of three feet, a low masonry wall of a minimum height of three feet, or a combination of the above with a minimum combined height of three feet. A wall used for parking lot screening should be accompanied with landscape planting in the form of low shrubs and groundcover to soften the appearance of the wall. 
(13)  A minimum of 50 percent of the total trees required for the property shall be canopy trees as specified on the approved plant list (see appendix A to this chapter). 
(14)  Necessary driveways from the public right-of-way shall be allowed through all required landscaping areas in accordance with city regulations. Shared drives shall be allowed through perimeter landscape areas. 
(15)  For all non-residential and multiple family parcels, whenever an off-street parking area or vehicular use area abuts an adjacent property line, a perimeter landscape area of at least five feet shall be maintained between the edge of the parking area and the adjacent property line. 
(16)  Whenever a non-residential use, mobile home use, or multiple family use is adjacent to a property used or zoned for single-family or duplex residential uses, the more intensive land use shall provide a landscaped area of at least ten feet in width along the common property line planted with one canopy tree for each 40 linear feet or portion thereof of adjacent exposure. These trees may not be clustered. 
(17)  Multiple family residential uses shall provide a landscaped buffer of at least 20 feet in width along all property lines planted with one canopy tree for each 30 linear feet or portion thereof of adjacent exposure. The trees along the street frontage may be clustered, while the trees along all other property lines may not. 
(18)  Evergreen shrubs (acceptable for six-foot screening) shall be provided around dumpster screening wall, and the plant materials must be a minimum of three feet in height at the time of planting, unless not visible from public right-of-way or a public use area. 
(19)  For all single family and duplex parcels, builders shall be required to plant two canopy trees per lot, prior to obtaining a certificate of occupancy. At least one of the trees shall be located in the front yard. If a required canopy tree is within 12 feet of a building foundation an alternate planting location on site shall be approved by the landscape administrator. An existing quality tree of at least eight-inch caliper size located on the lot may be counted towards the requirement for a four-inch caliper tree, if appropriate tree protection measures have been followed. 
(20)  For all commercial sites, developers shall install all required canopy trees per the approved landscape plan. If a required canopy tree is within 12 feet of a building foundation an alternate planting location on site shall be approved by the landscape administrator. 
(21)  For all townhome parcels a minimum of 20 square feet of useable open space shall be required per townhome unit. This additional open space shall not include the parkland dedication requirement as outlined in section 142-152 of the subdivision ordinance, any required landscape areas as outlined in section 146-135, or any required spacing between buildings. Open space pockets shall be designed to be located over the entire site in order to break up density and serve the entire development. Open space pockets shall be required to be a minimum of 1,000 square feet and a maximum of 2,000 square feet for townhome developments over 50 units. The applicant may request an increase in the maximum allowed useable open space requirement with site plan approval. 
(g)  Tree preservation. 
(1)  Any trees preserved on a site meeting the herein specifications may be credited toward meeting the tree requirement of any landscaping provision of this section for that area within which they are located, according to the following table: 
Caliper of existing tree 	Credit against tree requirement 
6" to 8" 	2 trees 
9" to 15" 	3 trees 
16" to 30" 	4 trees 
31" to 46" 	5 trees 
47" or more 	8 trees 
 
For purposes of this section, caliper measurement shall be taken at a height of 4½ feet above the ground, and shall be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
(2)  Existing trees may receive credit if they are not on the city's approved plant material list but are approved by the landscape administrator; however, trees must be located within the landscape area to which credit is applied. 
(3)  Any tree preservation proposed shall designate the species, size, and general location of all trees on the conceptual or general landscape plan. The species, size, and exact location shall be shown on the landscape plan. 
(4)  During any construction or land development, the developer shall clearly mark all trees to be maintained and may be required to erect and maintain protective barriers around all such trees or groups of trees. The developer shall not allow the movement of heavy equipment or the storage of equipment, materials, debris, or fill to be placed within the drip line of any trees. This is not intended to prohibit the normal construction required within parking lots. 
(5)  During the construction stage of development, the developer shall not allow cleaning of equipment or material under the canopy of any tree or group of trees to remain. Neither shall the developer allow the disposal of any waste material such as, but not limited to, paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, etc., under the canopy of any tree or groups of trees to remain. No attachment or wires of any kind, other than those of a protective nature, shall be attached to any tree. 
(h)  Sight distance and visibility. 
(1)  Rigid compliance with these landscaping requirements shall not be such as to cause visibility obstructions and/or blind corners at intersections. Whenever an intersection of two or more streets or driveways occur, a triangular visibility area, as described below, shall be created. Landscaping within the triangular visibility area shall be designed to provide unobstructed cross visibility at a level between two feet and seven feet. Trees may be permitted in this area provided they are trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross visibility area. The triangular areas shall comply with the sight triangle illustrations in this chapter (see appendix E, illustration 10). 
(2)  In the event other visibility obstructions are apparent in the proposed landscape plan, as determined by the landscape administrator, the requirements set forth herein may be modified to eliminate the conflict. 
(i)  Maintenance. 
(1)  The owner, tenant, and/or their agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Mowing (of grass of six inches or higher); 
b.  Edging; 
c.  Pruning; 
d.  Fertilizing; 
e.  Watering; 
f.  Weeding; and 
g.  Other such activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. 
(2)  Landscape areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds, and other such material or plants not a part of the landscaping. All plant material shall be maintained in a healthy and growing condition as is appropriate for the season of the year. 
(3)  Plant materials used to meet minimum required landscaping provisions which die or are removed for any reason shall be replaced with plant material of similar variety and size, within 90 days. 
a.  Trees with a trunk diameter in excess of six inches measured six inches above the ground may be replaced with trees of similar variety having a minimum trunk diameter of four inches measured six inches above the ground. 
b.  If any tree, which was preserved and used as a credit toward landscaping requirements is later removed for any reason, it shall be replaced by the number of trees for which it was originally credited. Replacement trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of four inches measured six inches above the ground. 
c.  A time extension may be granted by the landscape administrator if substantial evidence is presented to indicate abnormal circumstances beyond the control of the owner, tenant, or his agent. 
Failure to maintain any landscape area in compliance with this section is considered a violation of this section and may be subject to penalties of section 146-194.

b.  In specific situations, tree survey requirements may be reduced as follows: 
1.  Non-disturbance areas. The landscape administrator may approve a non-disturbance area to be designated on the tree survey. The non-disturbance area is an area in which no construction will occur. Trees within the non-disturbance area are not required to be individually identified on the tree survey unless they will be used as credits. 
2.  Aerial photograph. For property containing large, heavily wooded areas, the landscape administrator may, in lieu of a tree survey, authorize the submittal of an aerial photograph accompanied by a transparent plan of the development at the same scale as the photograph, showing all non-disturbance areas and proposed exemption areas where no trees will be critically altered; provided that a tree survey of all other areas is submitted to the landscape administrator prior to any grading or construction. The landscape administrator may approve the submission of photographs in phases for a multi-phased project. 
3.  No trees. If a property contains no trees, the applicant may indicate on the application for a tree permit that there are no trees on the property and submit the application for a tree permit in lieu of a tree survey. Such an application shall act in lieu of a tree survey upon a determination by the landscape administrator that no trees exist on the site. 
c.  A tree preservation plan shall be submitted showing major site construction features, existing trees to remain, trees being removed, and replacement trees with type, location, number and size of replacement trees indicated. The tree preservation plan information may be included on the tree survey if all information can be clearly delineated. The tree preservation plan shall include the following information: 
1.  The major site construction features; 
2.  The proposed and existing contours; 
3.  Identification of the caliper, species, and location of trees that are to remain; 
4.  Identification of the caliper, species, and location of trees to be removed; 
5.  The tree protection measures; and 
6.  The letter of intent. 
(2)  Review of application. 
a.  Tree permit applications. The landscape administrator shall grant a tree permit, provided the requirements of this section are met. 
b.  Grievances. An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the landscape administrator may appeal the decision to the board of adjustment for an interpretation as provided for in section 146-165(2). 
c.  Waivers. An application for a waiver to the terms of the tree preservation section may be made. The application for a waiver shall be reviewed by the tree board, and a recommendation for approval or denial shall be forwarded to the city council. The decision of the city council shall be final. A public hearing shall be required. The tree board and city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether a waiver should be granted: 
1.  The literal enforcement cannot be accomplished; 
2.  The extent to which the application meets other standards of this section; 
3.  The positive or negative impact of the proposed project on surrounding properties; and 
4.  The extent to which the waiver would be mitigated by other proposed or existing landscaping. 
d.  Non-substantive changes. The landscape administrator shall be authorized to work with owners, developers, and builders to make non-substantive changes, within the scope of this section, to plans, permits and other requirements after approval by staff, city council or the tree board, as appropriate. These changes are intended to provide the greatest reasonable protection toward achieving the purposes of this section. 
e.  Posting tree protection sign. After the tree permit is issued, the permit holder shall post a tree protection sign at each entrance to the property upon which one or more trees is situated, and at any other location designated by the landscape administrator. 
(f)  Standards. 
(1)  Clear-cutting. Clear-cutting is prohibited unless specifically authorized by a tree permit. 
(2)  Developments with an existing single family or duplex residential structure. All protected trees 27 inches in caliper or greater shall be subject to tree preservation requirements regardless of location. 
(3)  All other developments. 
a.  Perimeter tree zone. If a quality tree six inches or greater exists within 15 feet of the boundary line between an existing platted single family residential development and a proposed development, a perimeter tree zone shall be provided. The perimeter tree zone shall extend 15 feet out from each quality tree six inches or greater onto the proposed development for a maximum 30-foot wide perimeter tree zone. No tree within the perimeter tree zone may be critically altered. 
b.  Floodplain. Within the 100-year fully developed floodplain, 70 percent of quality trees that are six inches DBH or greater may not be critically altered. However, if the floodplain lies within the interior of property that is zoned for commercial uses, and construction of buildings or parking is to occur on both sides of the creek, there is no limitation on the number of trees that may be removed. Additionally, construction of roads that are required by the city to provide cross access to adjacent properties or to provide for a second point of access shall not count against the percentage that can be removed. 
c.  Specimen trees. Trees greater than 42 inches DBH may not be removed, nor may the critical root zone be altered. As part of a tree permit application the city arborist with the input of the director of planning and city engineer may approve the removal of specimen trees based on the type of tree, health of the tree, location of the tree on site, elevation of the tree, impact of the tree on the proposed site or development plan. If the city arborist denies the request to remove a specimen tree, the owner/applicant may appeal the decision to the city council. 
d.  Other trees. Notwithstanding the above provisions, all other quality trees greater than six inches DBH are subject to tree replacement and protection except where protected trees must be critically altered to: 
1.  Install and maintain any utility lines; 
2.  Dedicate public rights-of-way; 
3.  Construct any public or private streets or alleys at the minimum required width only; 
4.  Provide any required easement up to the minimum width needed to accommodate the required service; 
5.  Construct any fire lanes at the minimum required width only; 
6.  Construct any sidewalks; 
7.  Construct any driveways; 
8.  Construct fences and screening walls; 
9.  Construct patios; 
10.  Construct swimming pools and associated deck areas; 
11.  Construct required parking; 
12.  Install a building pad site; 
13.  Construct any hike/bike trails; or 
14.  Achieve cut and fill drainage as designed in master drainage construction plan, including required detention or retention ponds. Transitional slopes to the original grade, which are less steep than the maximum allowed slope shall not be exempt. 
(4)  Demolition. The landscape administrator may issue a limited purpose tree permit to allow critical alteration of a protected tree if such critical alteration is necessary to allow demolition of a structure. The protected tree covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of this section. 
(5)  Selective thinning. The landscape administrator may issue a limited purpose tree permit for selective thinning of certain protected trees from a densely forested area. The landscape administrator will, as part of the tree permit review process, determine whether the selective thinning proposed will be performed in a professionally accepted manner that will enhance the likelihood of survival for the remaining trees. If the landscape administrator issues a permit for selective thinning, the protected trees covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and tree protection requirements of this section. 
(6)  Diseased trees. Upon issuance of a limited purpose tree permit, a diseased protected tree may be critically altered to reduce the chances of spreading the disease to adjacent healthy trees. If the landscape administrator issues a limited purpose tree permit for such purpose, the protected trees covered by the permit shall be exempt from the tree replacement and protection requirements of this section. 
(7)  Ground level cuts. Tree trunks must be cut at ground level where removal of a tree may damage root systems of an adjacent tree. Stump grinding in such situations is allowed with the approval of the landscape administrator. 
(8)  Removal of underbrush. Removal of underbrush, not including grubbing under drip lines, shall not require a tree permit. 
(9)  Grubbing under drip lines. The landscape administrator shall issue a limited purpose tree permit allowing the clearing and grubbing of brush located within or under the drip lines of protected trees. 
(g)  Tree replacement. 
(1)  Unless specifically exempted, the following tree replacement procedures shall apply to any person who critically alters a protected tree for which a permit is required. Replacement trees shall be in addition to trees required under the landscape section of the zoning ordinance. 
a.  Generally. The protected tree shall be replaced with a quality tree or trees as approved on the tree preservation plan. 
1.  Size and number. A sufficient number of trees shall be planted to equal or exceed, in caliper, the caliper of each tree critically altered, measured at four feet six inches above ground level. Each replacement tree shall be a minimum of four-inch caliper at six inches above ground level and 12 feet in height when planted. The following formula shall be used to calculate the number of trees to be replaced: 
	Caliper of critically altered tree 	Replacement ratio (in inches of caliper) 	Minimum caliper of replacement tree 
Existing single family and duplex residential development 	>27" 	1:1 	4" 
			
All other development 	6"16" 	1:1 	4" 
	>16" 	1:2 	6" 
 
2.  Credits. When any quality tree of four (4) inches or more in caliper is preserved that would otherwise have been exempt, credits toward the total inches of caliper of replacement trees required for the development site will be given as per the following formula. Credits shall not reduce the minimum size of any replacement tree planted. 
3.  Location. Each replacement tree shall be planted on the same property as the tree that was critically altered. However, if the landscape administrator deems that the replacement tree cannot be planted on the same property in accordance with accepted arborists' standards, the landscape administrator may, as part of the city's reforestation plan, allow the following: 
(i)  Replacement on public property; 
(ii)  Replacement on private property if also approved by the chief building official; or 
(iii)  Require payment to the reforestation fund in accordance with subsection (g)(1)c of this section. 
4.  Responsibility to replace trees. The requirement to replace trees shall apply to both the person altering a protected tree and the owner of the property. 
5.  Replacement of dead trees. A replacement tree planted on the same property as the critically altered tree must be replaced if it dies. This requirement applies to the owner of the property. 
b.  Scheduling of replacement trees. Replacement trees shall normally be planted within 90 days of critical alteration. If replacement trees cannot be planted within 90 days of critical alteration, the landscape administrator may approve a delay in replacement of up to six months after the date of critical alteration. The applicant shall provide the landscape administrator with an affidavit that all replacement trees will be planted within six months. The landscape administrator may require the applicant to furnish the city a cash deposit or surety bond in the approximate amount of the cost to replace the trees. 
c.  Reforestation fund. If an applicant cannot replace trees on the same property, and if the landscape administrator does not approve replanting on an alternate site, the applicant shall make a payment into the reforestation fund. 
1.  The amount of payment required for each replacement tree shall be calculated based on a schedule published and reviewed annually by the landscape administrator which sets forth the average cost of a quality tree added to the average cost of planting a tree. 
2.  It shall be the responsibility of the landscape administrator to develop and administer a written plan for the planting, growing, replanting, and appropriate irrigation of trees on all municipal and public domain property. The tree board shall present the plan to the council and, when adopted by the council, the plan shall represent the reforestation plan for the city. 
3.  Reforestation funds shall be expended only for purchasing, planting, growing and/or irrigating trees as per the city's reforestation plan. Reforestation funds shall not be used for routine maintenance. 
4.  Funds paid into the reforestation fund shall be spent within three years of payment or shall be returned to the payer. 
5.  The landscape administrator shall submit periodic reports to the city council of the deposits and disbursements from the reforestation fund. 
(h)  Tree protection. 
(1)  The following procedures shall apply to any protected tree for which a permit is required, unless specifically exempted. 
a.  Construction plan requirements. All construction plans shall indicate tree protection measures. 
b.  Prohibited activities in primary root zone. The following activities are prohibited within the limits of the primary root zone of any protected tree subject to the requirements of this section. 
1.  Material storage. No materials intended for use in construction or waste materials shall be placed within the limits of the primary root zone of any protected tree. 
2.  Equipment cleaning/liquid disposal. No cleaning or other liquids shall be deposited or allowed to flow over land within the limits of the primary root zone of a protected tree. This includes, but is not limited to paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or similar materials. 
3.  Tree attachments. No signs, wires or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature, shall be attached to any protected tree. 
4.  Construction equipment/vehicular traffic. Unless otherwise approved by the landscape administrator, no vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the primary root zone of any protected tree other than on existing street pavement. This restriction does not apply to single incident access within the primary root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility maintenance, emergency restoration of utility service, or routine mowing operations. No heavy equipment, including, but not limited to, trucks, tractors, trailers, bulldozers, and bobcat tractors, shall be allowed inside the drip-line of any protected tree on any construction site without the specific approval of the landscape administrator. 
5.  Grade changes. Unless specifically allowed by this section, no grade changes shall be allowed within the limits of the primary root zone of any protected tree unless the landscape administrator and/or the city engineer approves adequate construction methods. 
6.  Impervious paving near nonexempt trees. Unless a health, safety and welfare issue arises due to access and circulation requirements, no paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious materials may be placed within 75 percent of the limits of the primary root zone of a protected tree except as otherwise allowed in this section. 
7.  Impervious paving near exempt, preserved trees. For any exempt tree that is being preserved the following shall apply: 
(i)  No paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious materials may be placed within a five-foot radius of the trunk; and 
(ii)  A total of 400 square feet of area on the primary root zone shall be kept free of impervious materials. This pervious area may be in the shape of a circle, rectangle, or other shape, and shall include and be contiguous with the area within a five-foot radius of the trunk. 
c.  Protective measures required prior to construction. Prior to construction, the contractor or subcontractor shall construct and maintain, for each protected tree on a construction site, a protective fence and where necessary, bark protection (see section A-3 of appendix A to this chapter). All protective measures shall be in place prior to commencement of any site work and remain in place until all exterior work has been completed. 
d.  Construction methods. 
1.  Boring. Boring of utilities under protected trees shall be required in those circumstances where it is not possible to trench around the primary root zone of the protected tree. When required, the length of the bore shall be the width of the primary root zone at a minimum and shall be a minimum depth of 48 inches. 
2.  Grade change. The landscape administrator may approve a grade change within the primary root zone of a protected tree as per this section and/or the city engineer. 
3.  Trenching. All trenching shall be designed to avoid trenching across the primary root zone of any protected tree, unless otherwise approved by the landscape administrator. Mechanical trenching within the primary root zone shall not be allowed. Trenching by hand shall not critically alter the root system. The placement of irrigation systems and underground utility lines such as electric, phone, gas, etc., shall be located outside of the primary root zone of protected trees. The minimum required single head supply line for irrigation systems is allowed to extend into the primary root zone perpendicular to the tree trunk and in the manner that has the least possible encroachment into the primary root zone. 
4.  Root pruning. All roots two inches or larger in caliper, which are exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation, shall be cut off square. 
(i)  Tree planting. 
(1)  In addition to the tree preservation and tree replacement provisions of this section, all applicable tree planting requirements of the landscape section of the city zoning ordinance shall apply. 
(2)  Selection and planting of all replacement trees shall comply with section 146-135.

Sec. 146-139. - Architectural and site standards. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum standards for the appearance of non-residential, attached single family residential (townhome), and multi-family residential buildings and corresponding site elements that are recognized as enhancing property values and that are in the interest of the general welfare of the city under the authority granted by Chapter 3000 of the Texas Local Government Code. The standards contained herein are intended to serve as a baseline for the minimum design expectations of the city. These standards are not intended to prohibit architectural innovation nor are they intended to mandate specific architectural styles and concepts. Rather, they are intended to provide for developments of enduring quality that provide visual character and interest. The illustrations contained herein are intended to serve as a visual representation of how the associated standards could be satisfied and not how they must be satisfied. The development community is encouraged to seek out new and innovative ways to implement the standards contained herein that will result in a significant contribution to the visual character of the area and the city as a whole. 
(b)  Applicability. The standards contained herein shall be applicable to all multi-family residential, attached single family residential, and non-residential buildings constructed after the effective date of this section, except the provisions of this section shall not apply to the following: 
(1)  Buildings constructed within the MTC McKinney town center district, which buildings are subject to the design requirements contained in appendix G of the zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Buildings constructed within the CHD commercial historic overlay district or H historic preservation overlay districts whose design conflicts with any applicable historic preservation design criteria because of the minimum requirements contained herein. 
(3)  Buildings that are four stories in height or taller which are located within the CC corridor commercial overlay district. 
(4)  Portable or temporary buildings for non-profit places of worship or private schools, which are screened from the view of adjacent properties and public rights-of-way via a building and/or a minimum six foot tall opaque screening device with canopy trees planted every 30 linear feet of visible exposure. 
(5)  Portable buildings or temporary buildings for public schools. 
(6)  Temporary uses defined under section 146-42 of this chapter. 
(7)  Buildings for which a site plan for the project was approved prior to the effective date of this section, provided: 
a.  The site plan has not expired; 
b.  A building permit has been issued; and 
c.  Construction is underway prior to the expiration of two years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(8)  Any expansion of an existing building that was constructed and occupied prior to the effective date of this section which utilizes exterior finishing materials of equal or higher quality than the existing building. 
(9)  Reconstruction of a non-residential or multi-family building due to damage of any kind that necessitates improving, rehabilitating, or reconstructing not more than 50 percent of the original structure or by the cumulative effect of a series of reconstructive activities up to not more than 50 percent of the original structure. 
(c)  Conflicts with other ordinances. All applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, building codes, planned development districts, and other ordinances shall apply. Where provisions of the zoning ordinance or other ordinances conflict with this section, the more restrictive provision shall control. 
(d)  Administration and interpretation. The provisions of this section shall be administered by the director of planning who shall also make interpretations regarding any subjectivity contained herein. Interpretations of the director of planning may be appealed to the executive director of development services. If the director of planning's interpretation is upheld by the executive director of development services, the applicant may request that the facade plan be forwarded to the planning and zoning commission via the process contained in section 146-139(e) of this chapter. 
(e)  Facade plan approval. The director of planning shall have the authority to approve or approve with conditions any facade plan that is deemed to satisfy the minimum requirements of this section. Applications shall include all information deemed necessary by the director of planning to thoroughly evaluate a proposed building's design for conformance with the provisions of this section. Any facade plan that the director of planning cannot approve due to nonconformance shall be forwarded to the planning and zoning commission for consideration and action. 
(1)  Facade plans that are considered by the planning and zoning commission shall require the issuance of property owner notification letters and the posting of informational signs on the subject property in accordance with the zoning change requirements outlined in section 146-164 of this chapter prior to holding a public hearing at a planning and zoning commission meeting. The decision of the planning and zoning commission may be appealed by the applicant or city staff to the city council.

Sec. 146-140. - Wind energy conversion system (WECS) regulations. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the location, design and appearance of wind energy conversion systems (WECS) and to encourage the preservation of the environment through the use of alternate energy sources, specifically wind energy. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Blade arc sphere is the three-dimensional sphere in the air created by the 360 degree rotation of the blades combined with the 360 degree rotation of the WECS nacelle. 
(2)  Building-mounted WECS is any WECS that is mounted directly to a building's roof, chimney, vent stack, cooling tower, dome, spire, or other similar structure, rather than a free-standing monopole support structure. This definition shall not include a WECS that is mounted to a building with a monopole taller than five feet in height. 
(3)  Free-standing WECS is any WECS that is self-supporting via a monopole support system and not mounted to a building or structure in any way. 
(4)  Height, for the purposes of this section, is measured from the average natural ground level to the highest point of the arc of the blades' elevation. If the WECS is building-mounted, the height is measured from the finished floor elevation of the building to the highest point of the arc of the blades' elevation. 
(5)  Nacelle is a streamlined enclosure that connects the blades and WECS hub to the WECS support tower and houses specific mechanical parts including, but not limited to braking mechanisms, shafts, gearboxes and generators. 
(6)  Wind energy conversion system(s) (WECS) is any device such as a wind charger, windmill, turbine, energy ball, vane, wind tower, or another similar device, which is typically mounted to a tower or pole, and its associated mechanical and electrical equipment, which is designed to convert wind energy to a form of usable energy. 
(c)  Permit required. No WECS shall be erected without first obtaining a WECS (wind turbine) permit from the chief building official, or their designee. The permit's application shall be submitted with the required numbers and types of plans as deemed necessary by the chief building official to adequately review the proposal. 
(d)  Specific use permit. In recommending that a specific use permit, established under these provisions, for the premises under consideration be granted, the planning and zoning commission and the city council shall determine that WECS are harmonious with and adaptable to building structures and other uses of the premises under consideration, abutting property and other property in the vicinity of the premises under consideration, the size of the premises under consideration is of sufficient size to accommodate the WECS, and that the wellbeing of the premises under consideration's property owner, adjacent property owners and citizens of the city is being protected. Staff and the planning and zoning commission shall make recommendations as to requirements for screening of the WECS, heights of the WECS, locations of the WECS, quantity of the WECS, and whether the premises under consideration is acceptable for the WECS being proposed. 
(e)  General regulations. 
(1)  All WECS shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and any other governmental agency with the authority to regulate such systems. 
(2)  No WECS shall exceed the height limitations imposed by virtue of aircraft approach and turning zone height restrictions. 
(3)  No grid-interconnected WECS shall be installed until evidence has been provided to the city that the appropriate electric power provider has approved the customer's intent to install a grid-connected customer-owned WECS and that the customer's system meets the utility's approved specifications for interconnection. 
(4)  A maximum of one WECS shall be permitted by right on each tract. The allowable number of WECS on each tract may be increased to a maximum of three WECS with the planning and zoning commission's approval of a proposed site plan. Prior to approving the additional number of WECS, the planning and zoning commission shall consider the same factors that are considered when approving a specific use permit as specified herein. The allowable number of WECS on each tract may be increased beyond a maximum of three WECS with approval of a specific use permit. 
(5)  WECS shall only be permitted on a tract of land as an accessory use to a separate, principal use. 
(6)  All WECS shall be located behind the front face of the primary structure. 
(7)  Any mechanical, electrical or other equipment associated with the tower or other support structure shall comply with the accessory building setbacks as specified in section 146-133 of the zoning regulations. 
(8)  Building-mounted WECS' blade arc spheres shall have a minimum five-foot clearance from any structure, tree or any other impediment. Free-standing WECS' blade arc spheres shall have a minimum 30-foot clearance from any structure, tree or any other impediment. 
(9)  No free-standing WECS shall include a ladder or any other tower climbing apparatus within 12 feet of the ground. 
(10)  All commercial signs, flags, lights, and attachments shall be prohibited on a WECS, unless required for communications operations, structural stability, or as required for flight visibility by the FAA. 
(11)  All WECS shall be filtered, shielded or otherwise designed and constructed so as not to cause electrical, radio frequency, television, and other communication signal interference. 
(12)  All WECS shall be painted a neutral or earth tone color. The paint type shall be a dull or matte finish so as to reduce the possibility of any glares or reflections and to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of the WECS. 
(13)  All WECS shall be constructed in a monopole design of tubular steel and shall be self-supporting without the use of guy wires or other similar features. 
(14)  All WECS shall be equipped with a manual and/or an automatic braking device capable of stopping the WECS operation in high winds. 
(15)  All WECS shall be grounded and shielded to protect against natural lightning strikes and stray voltage, including the blades, in accordance with the National Electric Code. 
(16)  All WECS shall be designed to withstand loads including, but not limited to ice and wind, as detailed in the International Building Code. 
(17)  All WECS shall be adequately designed structurally, electrically, and in all other respects to accommodate the safety and general wellbeing of the public. All WECS shall be required to meet all applicable regulations specified in the International Building Code, National Electric Code, and any other applicable regulatory documents. 
(18)  All WECS shall be maintained at all times according to the manufacturer's specifications and all other applicable regulations including, but not limited to the International Building Code and the National Electric Code. 
(19)  All WECS shall adhere to the maximum sound pressure levels as specified in section 146-134 of the zoning regulations.

2.  If a written, signed protest is filed by owners of at least 20 percent of either: 
(i)  The area of the lots or land covered by the proposed change; or 
(ii)  The area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area covered by the proposed change and extending 200 feet from that area including any streets and alleys. 
b.  Written protest procedures. The form of the protest shall be as follows: 
1.  A protest must be in writing and, at a minimum, contain the following information: 
(i)  A description of the zoning case at issue; 
(ii)  The names of all persons protesting the proposed change in zoning district classification or boundary; 
(iii)  A description of the area of lots or land owned by the protesting parties that is either covered by the proposed change or located within 200 feet of the area covered by the proposed change; 
(iv)  The mailing addresses of all persons signing the protest; and 
(v)  The date and time of its execution. 
2.  The protest must bear the original signatures of all persons required to sign under subsection (5)c of this section and acknowledged under subsection (5)d of this section. 
c.  Required signatures. 
1.  A protest must be signed by the owner of the property in question, or by a person authorized by power of attorney to sign the protest on behalf of the owner. In the case of non-community property owned by two or more persons, the signature by any one owner of the property, or by a person authorized by power of attorney to sign the protest on behalf of any one owner, binds the entire property to the protest. In the case of community property, the written protest of one spouse will bind the property in its entirety. 
2.  In the case of property owned by a corporation, the protest must be signed by the president, a vice-president, or by an attorney-in-fact authorized to sign the protest on behalf of the corporation. In the case of property owned by a general or limited partnership, the protest must be signed by a general partner or by an attorney-in-fact authorized to sign the protest on behalf of the partnership. 
3.  Lots or land subject to a condominium regime are presumed to be commonly owned in undivided interests by the owners of all condominium units and under the control of the governing body of the condominium. For such lots or land to be included in calculating the lots or land area protesting a proposed rezoning, the written protest must state that the governing body of the condominium has authorized a protest in accordance with procedures required by its bylaws, and that the person signing the protest is authorized to act on behalf of the governing body of the condominium. A written protest signed by the owner of an individual condominium unit shall not be accepted unless the filing party produces legal documents governing the condominium which clearly establish the right of an individual owner to act with respect to his respective undivided interest in the common elements of the condominium. 
4.  When signatures must be acknowledged by a notary public. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (5)c.2 and 3 of this section, all signatures on a written protest, whether by petition or letter, must be acknowledged before a notary public as provided herein. The notary requirement is fulfilled if the person who obtains the signatures signs a certification (known as a jurat) stating: 
(i)  That he witnessed those signatures; and 
(ii)  That the signatory represented his authority to sign the petition. 
5.  The city shall be required to forward to the owners entitled to notice hereunder, in addition to the required notice, a reply form for the lodging of protests.

1.  In all cases where a protest has been properly signed pursuant to this subsection, the city shall presume that the signatures appearing on the protest are authentic and that the persons or officers whose signatures appear on the protest are either owners of the property or authorized to sign on behalf of one or more owners as represented. 
2.  The city attorney may advise the city council that the presumption in subsection (5)f.1 of this section should not be followed in a specific case based on evidence presented. 
g.  Conflicting instruments. In the event that multiple protests and withdrawals are filed on behalf of the same owner, the instrument with the latest date and time of execution controls.

A board of adjustment is hereby established in accordance with the provisions of Texas Local Government Code § 211.008 et seq., regarding the zoning of cities and with the powers and duties as provided in said statutes.

a.  Membership. The board shall consist of five citizens, each to be appointed or reappointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council, for staggered terms of two years. In addition, two alternate members shall be similarly appointed to serve in the absence of one or more regular members. Each member of the board, regular and alternate, shall be removable for cause by city council upon a written charge and after a public hearing.

All hearings before the board must be heard by at least four members of the board. 
d.  Rules and regulations. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.

The board shall adopt from time to time such additional rules and regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the ordinance, and shall furnish a copy of the same to the chief building official, all of which rules and regulations shall operate uniformly in all cases. All of its resolutions and orders shall be in accordance therewith. 
(2)  Appeals. 
a.  Procedure. Appeals may be taken from an administrative officer's decision and may be taken to and before the board of adjustment by any person aggrieved by the decision, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by the decision. The appellant must file with the board and the official from whom the appeal is taken a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for the appeal. The appeal must be filed not later than the 20 th day after the date the decision is made. On receiving the notice, the official from whom the appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record of the action that is appealed. 
b.  Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action that is appealed unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies in writing to the board facts supporting the official's opinion that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, the proceedings may be stayed only be a restraining order granted by the board or a court of record on application, after notice to the official, if due cause is shown. 
c.  Notice of hearing on appeal. The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matters referred to it, shall give public notice of the hearing, and shall mail notices of such hearing to the petitioner and to the owners of property lying within 200 feet or less of any point of the lot or portion thereof on which a variance is desired, and to all other persons deemed by the board to be effected thereby, such owners and persons being determined according to the current tax rolls of the city. Depositing of such written notice in the mail, postage-paid, shall be deemed sufficient compliance therewith. 
d.  Decision by board. The board shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time, not later than the next meeting for which notice can be provided following the hearing and not later than the 60 th day after the date the appeal is filed. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination from which an appeal is taken and make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as in its opinion ought to be made, and to that end, shall have the same authority as the administrative official. 
(3)  Powers and duties of board. 
a.  Subpoena witnesses, etc. The board shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and records, administer oaths, and punish for contempt, and may require the production of documents, under such regulations as it may establish. 
b.  Appeals based on error. The board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the chief building official in the enforcement of this chapter. 
c.  Special exceptions. The board shall have the power to hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this chapter upon which the board is required to pass as follows or elsewhere in this chapter: 
1.  To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises for railroads if such uses are in general conformance with the master plan and present no conflict or nuisance to adjacent properties; 
2.  To permit a public utility or public service or structure in any district, or a public utility or public service building of a ground area and of a height otherwise in conflict with the standards provided for in the district in which such public utility or public service building is permitted to be located, when found reasonably necessary for the public health, convenience, safety, or general welfare; 
3.  To grant a permit for the extension of a use, height and/or area regulation into an adjoining zoning district, where the boundary line of the zoning district divides a lot in a single ownership on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived; 
4.  Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building, which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy, to the extent of more than 50 percent of its fair market value, where the board finds some compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly; and 
5.  Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the districts, whenever the character of use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience. 
The board shall also have the power to hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of chapter 122, article IV, entitled "Fences" in accordance with the requirements set forth in section 122-178. 
d.  Variances. The board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done, including the following: 
1.  Permit a variance in the yard requirements of any district where there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of these provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot, topographical or other conditions, provided such variance will not seriously affect any adjoining property or the general welfare; and 
2.  Authorize upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the construction or alterations of buildings or structures will impose upon him unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship, such variances from the strict application of this chapter as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent, but only when the board is satisfied that a granting of such variance will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variance from the zoning ordinance as established by this chapter, and at the same time, the surrounding properties will be properly protected. 
e.  Changes. The board shall have no authority to change any provisions of this chapter and its jurisdiction is limited to hardship and borderline cases, which may arise from time to time. The board may not change the district designation of any land either to a more restrictive or less restrictive zone. In addition, the board may not add a use or authorize a use in a zoning district where such use is not otherwise permitted save and except through the approval of a special exception under subsection (3)c.3, hereinabove. 
f.  Amortization of nonconforming land uses. The board shall have the authority to establish a compliance date for nonconforming uses at the request of the city council in accordance with section 146-40 (Nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures) of this chapter. 
(4)  Public hearings and notices. 
a.  Public hearings required. Public hearings shall be required in conjunction with requests for variances and special exceptions, appeals of an administrative official's determination and appeals based on error. Public hearings shall also be required for determinations regarding legal nonconformities, the continuing lawful use of nonconforming uses and property and structures, the expansion of or changes in nonconforming uses and the reconstruction of nonconforming structures. Public hearings are also required for all matters regarding the amortization of nonconforming uses and the establishment of compliance dates. 
b.  Notice of public hearings. Notice of public hearings be provided as follows: 
1.  Written notice mailed to the parties in interest and to each owner of property, as indicated by the most recently approved tax roll, lying within 200 feet or less of any point or portion of the subject property prior to the tenth day before the date of the hearing; and 
2.  Publication in the official newspaper of the city prior to the 15th day before the date of the hearing.

Section B-2. - Regional employment centerOverlay urban design standards.	
I.Overview.A.General purpose. The following standards and guidelines implement the amendments to the future land use plan for the city's regional employment center (REC). Proposed zoning of the property shall be in keeping with the future land use plan. These urban design standards and guidelines are implemented by means of an overlay zoning district for the REC, and these standards and guidelines are applicable in the REC base zoning districts.
The purpose of these standards and guidelines is to allow for the development of fully integrated pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, corridors and districts in the REC. The intent is to minimize traffic congestion, relative infrastructure costs, and environmental degradation while improving quality of life and promoting the health, safety and welfare of neighborhood communities. The standards and guidelines are based on the following principles:

All neighborhoods have identifiable centers and edges.Shopping, recreation and basic neighborhood services are accessible by non-vehicular means in the neighborhoods.Each neighborhood shall provide a mixed-use neighborhood center accessible by walking no more than one-half mile.Uses and housing types are mixed and in close proximity to one another, utilizing urban design to facilitate the compatibility of different uses.The streets, blocks, and the placement of buildings on lots encourage pedestrian activity.Streets are interconnected, forming a network.Civic buildings and civic space are given prominent sites.Parks are evenly distributed throughout neighborhoodswithin one-quarter of a mile from most dwelling units.Schools are located within a ten-minute walk or one-half mile from a majority of the dwelling units in a neighborhood.B.Overlay categories. The design standards are organized and divided into three overlay zoning categories. These overlay categories will match appropriate urban design with the desired vision for a given area, while maintaining the projected tax base profile of the REC as generally established in the future land use plan.
The three overlay categories are as follows:

1.Neighborhood zone.
Intent and purpose: Each development shall be predicated on the neighborhood as the basic unit of development, with a distinct edge and center that provides the location for the neighborhood's civic buildings (e.g., churches, libraries and meeting halls), primary civic open spaces and primary neighborhood commercial uses. Generally, larger residential lots should be strategically located so that higher intensity residential development is located within and adjacent to neighborhood activity centers.

2.The Collin-McKinney Parkway corridor zone.
Intent/purpose: This zone shall provide opportunities for the public to live, work, shop, walk, bicycle and drive within and through the REC and adjacent developments while minimizing conflicts between different modes; to promote an orderly, visually pleasing and active street and parkway environment for workers, residents and visitors; to accommodate the automobile but not at the expense of the pedestrian; to provide adequate and efficient servicing of the development by trucks and utility vehicles throughout the REC, but to minimize the visual and auditory impact of such service; to strengthen relationships and encourage movement between important destinations inside and outside the development.

3.Commercial/employment zone.
Intent/purpose: Commercial/employment districts are located principally along SH 121 and in some locations along Custer Road. The intended uses in these districts are large employers involved in commercial/light industrial activity that are dependent upon SH 121 and are not easily incorporated into the fabric of a town center or neighborhood. Buildings of all sizes, large and small, are allowed in commercial/employment districts, as are the associated parking lots, loading and shipping facilities of light industrial activity. Residential uses are permitted above nonresidential uses to promote with the mixed use strategy for the REC. (See § B-1 of this appendix)

II.Definitions.
Alley: A narrow service access to the rear of buildings providing service areas, parking access, and utility easements.

"A" type streets: Streets designed with, or characterized by, features that promote safety, comfort, and convenience of pedestrians and transit users. "A" Streets shall provide monolithic curbing, sidewalks at least five feet wide (at least ten feet wide in neighborhood centers), "street" trees, narrow streets with narrow curb turning radii at intersections, buildings sited close to the street, pedestrian-scaled lighting, on-street parking, no onsite parking between the street and the building facade facing the street with all onsite parking located behind the rear face of the building, aligned front building facades, and building entrances facing the street. The "A" streets shall be organized in a continuous network so that the pedestrian experience is uninterrupted throughout the neighborhood. On type "A" streets, 100 percent of the off-street surface parking shall be located behind the rear face of the building.

"B" type streets: All other streets that are not "A" type streets.

"Big-box" retail: Typically single stores located in a building larger than 60,000 square feet, which are often grouped with other "big-box" stores and which are distinguished by substantial setbacks and large parking lots with little or no pedestrian access.

Build-to line: The build-to line on a block is the surveyed line of a uniform distance away from the front property line, up to which front building facades are required to be built. Porches, eaves and awnings may encroach across the build-to line. The build-to line shall be established and platted based upon the applicable standards herein in order to create an even building facade line along the street.

Commercial frontage: The utilization of storefronts, entryways, transparent windows, cafes, and courtyards with active uses, creating an active pedestrian environment along a street.

Community green: An area of smooth turf enabling gatherings for outdoor events and activities, bounded by a concentration of uses including commercial, retail, residential, community, civic and public.

Corner store: A retail store no greater than 4,000 square feet in gross floor area that is located on a corner and fronts onto a major local street or greater street, which provides retail services and goods primarily oriented to serve the residents of the immediately surrounding neighborhood. Residential and other permitted uses are encouraged on the upper level.

Courtyard: A hard-surfaced or landscaped space within a lot, open and unobstructed to the sky so as to receive sunlight, located at or above grade level, and bounded on three or more sides by the walls of a building or a vegetative wall.

Developer: Any person seeking approval under these standards and guidelines for any form of development.

Dwelling unit: One or more rooms providing complete living facilities, including kitchen facilities or equipment for cooking or provisions for the same, and including room or rooms for living, sleeping, bathing and eating.

Internal open space: Plazas, commons, greens, tot lots, non-municipally owned urban parks, squares, but not utility easements, which provides a central focus for a neighborhood mixed-use area and which is accessible so that the open space is within walking distance (no more than 1,320 feet) of 90 percent of the lots of the neighborhood.

Live/work unit: A dwelling unit providing for a combination of uses in which employment can occur on a segregated floor of a residential structure. There shall be allowed a maximum of one nonresident employee per live/work unit, requiring one additional off-street parking space.

Mixed-use: A building or connected buildings that contain both residential and commercial uses.

Net average density: The number of dwelling units per acre averaged over the neighborhood portion of a development (i.e., not the Collin McKinney Parkway Corridor portion), net of rights-of-way, open space, and other nonresidential uses.

Neighborhood center: An area reserved as a place for the neighborhood development, which provides a community gathering place such as a green, plaza or commercial Main Street. The neighborhood center shall accommodate civic, restaurant, retail and mixed use residential uses.

Neighborhood development: An area 40 to 160 acres in size with a mix of housing types, providing at least one neighborhood center.

Peripheral open space: Woodlands, areas surrounding creeks or ponds, other preserved natural areas, community gardens, golf courses and other semi-natural recreation areas such as disc-golf courses. Peripheral open space may not be used to meet the internal open space requirement.

Plaza: An animated gathering space, predominately hard-surfaced with complimentary landscaping, water features, and other site furnishings; framed on at least two-sides by the vertical rise of building walls; or framed by closely planted large maturing trees in lieu of buildings.

Retail access "sleeve": A narrow street with sidewalks or an improved pedestrianway that connects a neighborhood internally with a retail center that is typically located on an arterial or at the intersection of major thoroughfares, enabling the residents of the neighborhood to access the retail center without having to travel onto the arterial or major thoroughfares.

ROW: The right-of-way, or the dedicated strip of land that encompasses a publicly owned infrastructure, such as a street and sidewalk.

Single-loaded street: A drive that has improved lots running along only one side of the street and typically providing access to a public open space along the other side of the street.

Street cross-section proportions/ratios: The proportion or ratio, between width and eave height, of the space between facing buildings on opposite sides of a street. For example, a street open space of 60 feet between buildings 30 feet in height would have a streetscape ratio of 2:1.

"Street" trees: Trees planted in the planting strip or parkway between the sidewalk and the street, approximately spaced 30 feet on-center.

Town house/row house: Attached dwellings with each unit providing a separate public street entrance and frontage.

Urban (pedestrian-oriented): A development pattern characterized by a mix of commercial, institutional, residential (often times vertically integrated with non-residential uses), and recreational uses located in close proximity to one another connected via a network of streets accommodating the automobile while encouraging pedestrian interaction and activity. Urban features often include, but are not limited to: Aligned front building facades pulled closely to the street; street trees, pedestrian-scaled lighting, and pedestrian seating defining and protecting the pedestrian realm between streets and building facades; on-street parking offering direct access into building entrances; off-street parking areas located behind buildings; and centrally located open spaces (parks, plazas, courtyards, squares) offering public gathering areas.

III.Overarching design guidelines. The following design standards are applicable for all developments within the REC:A.The regional context.1.Neighborhood location shall be consistent with the future land use plan for REC, including the preservation of open space and development of alternative modes of transportation, including hiking, biking and public transit.2.Neighborhoods should be connected in as many locations as possible to adjacent developments and thoroughfares.3.Highways and arterial roads shall go around the neighborhoods rather than through them. Where they do come in contact with the neighborhoods, these roads should be designed for low speeds.4.Arterial roadways through neighborhoods and urban activity centers should take the form of the type "A" or Main Street or an avenue. At the edge of the neighborhood they should take the form of a parkway or a boulevard.5.A network of interconnecting streets shall be developed to create several alternative routes through and between neighborhoods and commercial/employment districts.6.The interconnecting street network is not meant to be and should not provide a cut-through alternative to arterials.B.The site context.1.All lakes, ponds, creeks, wetlands, and other natural features should be retained in the design and development process.2.Significant natural amenities should be fronted by streets or paths at least 30 percent of their length rather than privatized behind backyards.3.Submitted plans should locate neighborhood centers and sub-centers such as squares, greens, and parks at significant tree stands and other natural amenities.4.All developments should conform to the site topography to minimize the amount of grading necessary to achieve a viable street network.C.Gateways and vistas.1.Generally. Views of significant features and buildings should be preserved and enhanced to aid the public in becoming oriented within an area.2.View corridors.a.Street vistas should terminate with a significant view or building. A carefully sited building, public tract, a view of a natural feature, or an angle in the street shall terminate street vistas.b.Developments shall include a plan to protect important views by designating the following on subsequent site plans:i.Locations from which significant views of natural features are visible; locations from which water features or parkland can be seen and from which access is possible; and the location of open space, buildings, landscaping, and pathways that will protect, provide access to, or provide a frame for these significant views.ii.Locations from which views of major landmarks of the built environment, such as fountains, sculpture, or important architectural features either within or outside a development are visible, and the location of open space, buildings, landscaping, and pathways that will protect, provide access to, or provide a frame for these significant views.3.Focal points.a.The site design should designate major entranceways into a development and include some type of entry feature such as landscaping, an entry monument, sculpture or fountain.b.At gateways into the REC and key intersections of arterials within the REC, ornamental landmarks should be integrated into site design to create visual focal points and a sense of identity. These should include monuments, artwork, and/or ornamental landscaping features.D.Connectivity, linkages and access.1.Because the REC street and pedestrian network can serve as a bicycle route as part of the regional bicycle system, all developments should consider, in the site design, locations for bicycle parking and bicycle access connecting with the regional routes.2.Developments shall make provisions for bicycle trails, lanes and routes as part of an interconnected system, as directed by these guidelines and the city master park and trails plan.3.Single-loaded collector and neighborhood streets should abut at least 30 percent of the total area along creeks and waterways.E.Site design.1.All buildings shall face public streets unless they face a plaza or a courtyard.2.Site design shall provide direct access into the buildings from the public sidewalk.3.Sites shall be designed with a continuous pedestrian system throughout the development.4.All A/C units, HVAC systems, exhaust pipes and stacks, elevator housing, satellite dishes and other such devices shall be thoroughly screened by walls, fencing, roof elements, penthouse-type screening devices, or landscaping.F.Reserved.G.Sign design standards. All signs within the REC area shall comply with the following sign regulations:1.For "A" streets, apply commercial historic district sign standards.2.Neon signs are permitted on "A" streets.3.For all other streets, the regulations of the city sign ordinance shall apply, except that billboards shall be prohibited.H.Landscaping standards.1.Landscaping should be integrated with other functional and ornamental site design elements, where appropriate, such as recreational facilities, ground paving materials, paths and walkways, fountains and other features, trellises, pergolas, gazebos, fences, walls, street furniture, and public art.2.Landscaping and site treatment plans should consider seasonal flowers in planters, planting beds, and hanging baskets.3.To conserve energy, landscaping should include the planting of evergreen windbreaks to block the northwest winds in the winter, thereby reducing heating energy costs. Deciduous trees shall be planted near the southern facades of buildings to block summer sun, thereby reducing solar heat gain during the summer months.4.Detention basins, headwalls, outlet structures, concrete flow channels, rip rap channels, and other drainage improvements shall be screened with plant material and/or berms. Such drainage structures, as appropriate, shall be situated in the least visible locations or, if visible, incorporated into the natural curves of the land. Detention basin embankment and the basin itself shall be extensively landscaped with wet-site-tolerant plant materials and shall be sized to accommodate the future growth of the planted vegetation.5.Shade trees.a.Shade trees shall be provided along each side of all streets, public or private, existing or proposed. Shade trees shall also be massed at critical points, such as at focal points along a curve in the roadway. In locations where healthy and mature shade trees currently exist, the requirements for new tress may be waived or modified. For single family residential lots, the shade tree requirement shall count as one of the required "lot" trees.b.Shade trees shall have a minimum caliper of three inches and/or a minimum height of ten feet at time of planting, and a maximum spacing of 30 feet on center, with exact spacing to be evaluated on a site specific basis.I.Lighting standards.1.Along all type "A" streets, commercial or mixed use streets, parking areas, sidewalks, walkways, courtyards, community greens, and interior open spaces in a neighborhood, maximum 13-foot high decorative lamps and lamp posts shall be provided. On commercial streets these lamp posts shall be spaced no more than 80 feet on center. On local streets, lighting should be confined to intersections and corners.2.In parking lots, post height may be extended to maximum of 16 feet.IV.Neighborhood zone.
Intent and purpose: Each development shall be predicated on the neighborhood as the basic unit of development, with a distinct edge and center that provides the location for the neighborhood's civic buildings (e.g., churches, libraries and meeting halls), primary civic open spaces and primary neighborhood commercial uses. Generally, larger residential lots should be strategically located so that higher intensity residential development is located within and adjacent to neighborhood activity centers.

A.Land use mix and allocation.1.Each neighborhood development is defined as an area 40 to 160 acres in size and shall provide at least one neighborhood center. The size of a neighborhood development may be increased as part of the zoning process in order to provide flexibility for large master planned developments. A sustainable neighborhood provides a mix of uses and activities, including shopping, employment, schools, recreation, civic and all types of housing, which enables people of all ages and means to access conveniently the various services and uses needed and desired, whether one is driving, cycling or walking.2.Each neighborhood shall include a mix of uses as follows on a gross acreage basis:
Public, civic and open space	515%
Neighborhood retail center	210%
Residential	7593%
 

a.Public and civic uses include non-municipally owned public parks, other improved internal open space, schools, churches, amenity centers (e.g., pools, tennis courts) and other public facilities.
41appb-2

b.The minimum internal open space for any one neighborhood development shall be the greater of two acres or five percent of the gross acreage of the development. Dedicated trailways may account for no more than 25 percent of the minimum internal open space requirement.c.Flood plains can be counted as open space, provided that they abut a single-loaded street with lots on the other side of the street facing the flood plain open space, and that they provide for and permit pedestrian access.d.Commercial retail uses are intended to be principally neighborhood services, shopping, professional services, and sit-down restaurants; but they are not intended to be "big box" retail, general office, or any use greater than 20,000 square feet. This notwithstanding, retail uses greater than 20,000 square feet that do not exceed 60,000 square feet are allowed only if they front a major arterial, and if the site design for the uses provides for direct pedestrian and vehicular access from the adjacent neighborhood via the use of an access "sleeve" so that vehicles and pedestrians can access the retail site without the utilization of the arterial.

4.Each single family detached dwelling is permitted to contain an accessory dwelling unit in the rear yard, such as an apartment over the garage, or a freestanding structure.5.For purposes of residential density calculation, only primary units shall count as dwelling units; accessory residential units on single family residential lots and dwellings above nonresidential uses shall not count as dwelling units.6.Subsidized housing should be architecturally indistinguishable from market-rate housing. Residential densities shall be as follows:
For Developments Within 800 Feet of the Right-of-Way of Collin-McKinney Parkway	For All Other Developments in Neighborhoods
Minimum net average density:	N/A	4 dwelling units/acre
Maximum net average density:	No maximum	18 dwelling units/acre
 

7.Residential net density should generally decrease from the community green and/or neighborhood center towards the periphery. Smaller lots and higher density blocks are generally located closer to the community green and Main Street commercial area. The segregation of dwelling unit types is discouraged and different types of dwelling units may be mixed in any distribution within any single block.8.Apartments intended to develop in an urban, pedestrian-oriented manner shall be designed in multiple small buildings that are sited on the street's build-to line, and such that each ground floor unit faces the street in order to maximize compatibility with the urban design of the other adjacent residential and commercial uses. Apartment buildings that do not intend to develop in an urban manner shall follow the alternative setbacks provided for in the Area and Bulk Regulations for Apartment Dwellings of the Neighborhood Zone.
41appb-5

9.Within a mixed-use development in the neighborhood center, residential dwellings shall not be located on the ground floor, although ground floor entryways to internal stairwells are permitted.10.Like uses should be placed across the street from one another.11.Elementary schools should be located no more than ten minutes' walking distance from most dwellings, roughly one-half mile, and should be easily accessible on foot. Residential developers should confer with the applicable school district to determine the need and desired location for new school sites.12.Open space within the neighborhood should not be leftover space, but rather it should be parks, greens, squares, or plazas designed as a network.

41appb-47

A street-level exterior public pedestrian way through the middle of the block, at least ten feet wide, providing a connection to a public courtyard or a street parallel to the parkway. The pedestrian way should be located only where block size and scale of development are large enough to allow internalized service and ensure adequate pedestrian flows without detracting from activity on adjacent streets. The design of the enclosing walls should provide adequate sunlight and sky view. Building edges should accommodate public uses, such as shops and restaurants that are accessible from the pedestrian way. Public seating should be integrated where possible.

b.Courtyard.
Courtyard

Courtyard

A landscaped open space enclosure in the center of a block with minimal or no street frontage, which is large enough to allow for public activities and sunlight during midday. Although inwardly oriented, the courtyard should be considered part of a larger set of connected public spaces with access through an adjacent building or public places such as a pedestrian way, plaza or galleria. Primarily enclosed by buildings, the courtyard should have a high degree of visibility both at grade and above, to provide overlook and to encourage surveillance of the internal space. The location and design of entrances to the courtyard are critical in order to ensure that they are clearly identifiable and promote public use.

c.Urban garden.
Urban Garden

Urban Garden

An intimate scale garden that should be located and oriented to receive maximum sunlight during midday. It should be enclosed by buildings on two or three sides and open to the street on one or two sides. Street edges should be screened with a combination of architectural and landscaped elements. Adjoining buildings should contain windows overlooking the garden, but the garden should not provide primary access to an individual building. The design should not create visual obstructions, dead end spaces or other security hazards. Each garden "room" should contain a high quality focal point such as a water feature or public art.

d.Plaza.
Plaza

Plaza

A predominantly hard-surfaced space that is a portion of a block with a minimum of one side open to the street, which is located to provide maximum sunlight during the day but generally not located at the corner of the block. Adjacent buildings primarily define the plaza. Building edges should contain continuous public uses at grade to animate and support the open space. Large plazas should provide substantially continuous weather protection by the utilization of canopies or arcades at their edges. Unlike intimate scale urban gardens, a plaza may contain a primary entrance to an adjacent building. The floor of the plaza should be at the same grade as the sidewalk serving the adjacent street for easy access, with no more than 50 percent of the square footage deviating no more than three feet above or below grade.

3.Alternatives: The director of planning shall have discretion to approve other open space amenities with attributes similar to those described above.
41appb-51

4.All outdoor public open spaces described above shall provide: (i) at least one shade tree or planter; and (ii) at least one linear foot of seating for each 75 square feet of open space. Ledges and benches that provide seating on both sides and are at least 30 inches deep will count double. Level and flat planter rims that are not higher than two feet and are at least eight inches deep also count as seating as long as protruding vegetation does not obstruct them. Movable chairs are counted as 30 inches of linear seating per chair and may be stored after hours of operation. Corners and the space of steps that are wider than 15 feet may count as seating. Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, a plaque shall be placed in a publicly conspicuous location outside the building at street level, or at the side of an outdoor open space, identifying the open space furniture, stating the right of the public to use the space and the hours of use, and stating the name and address of the owner or owner's agent responsible for maintenance including the city if the open space is to be maintained by the city.5.Cross-sectional proportions of squares and plazas should have a ratio between space width and adjacent building heights of 1:1 to 1:3. This ratio should never be greater than 1:6.

If surface parking is provided on the side of the building, the parking frontage to the street should not exceed 50 percent of the linear frontage of the building it serves, and the frontage should be screened by a wall or landscaping that is aligned with the build-to line of the street.4.If adjacent uses complement one another in terms of the days and time of uses, the director of planning shall have the discretion to count shared parking towards off-street parking requirements, as provided for in the section 146-130(3) and section 146-130(5) of the city zoning ordinance (parking requirements).5.Structured parking facilities shall be designed so that the only openings at the street level are those to accommodate vehicle entrances and pedestrian access to the structure. The remainder of the street-level frontage on Collin-McKinney Parkway shall be designed for retail, commercial or civic uses, other than parking. On other streets within the corridor, the street-level frontage shall either be designed for retail, commercial or civic uses, other than parking or designed with an architecturally articulated facade to screen the parking areas of the structure.6.Facilities designed to park and lock bicycles shall be provided for each building with commercial uses greater than 5,000 square feet.VI.Commercial/employment zone.
Intent/purpose: Commercial/employment districts are located principally along SH 121 and in some locations along Custer Road. The intended uses in these districts are large employers involved in commercial/light industrial activity that are dependent upon SH 121 and are not easily incorporated into the fabric of a town center or neighborhood. Buildings of all sizes, large and small, are allowed in Commercial/Employment Districts, as are the associated parking lots, loading and shipping facilities of light industrial activity. Minimum standards are provided below in order to ensure basic compatibility with the neighborhoods and the Parkway Corridor to the north. Residential uses are permitted above nonresidential uses to promote the mixed-use strategy for the REC.

A.Site design.1."Big box" retail and shopping center guidelines:a.Developments shall create a continuous public edge and streetscape on all frontages by using a combination of the following:i.Building face;ii.Low wall, canopy structure or attractive fence;iii.Articulated screening wall around service/loading areas to screen trucking activities from pedestrian areas;iv.Street furniture; andv.Landscaping; as well as incorporation of signage into any of the above.b.Buildings shall be designed to face the street. All entrances and exits shall have a continuous pedestrian walkway that is connected to a public sidewalk.c.Additional requirements:i.Pedestrians should have accessibility between the public streets and the building without having to walk through a surface parking lot, unless the parking lot is transected with a covered walkway of at least 15 feet wide that connects the building to the street.ii.Pedestrian walkways should be protected from vehicular intrusions with landscaping, curbs, bollards or other elements integrated into the overall streetscape design.iii.At least 35 percent of the facade on the ground level floor facing the primary street shall provide windows and doors that allow for visibility into the commercial building or store.iv.Blank facades shall not be exposed to the public streets. Buildings with long facades (greater than 40 feet) should be massed and articulated by design elements including texture, canopies, fenestrations, and the vertical expression of structural bays so that the scale of the building does not overwhelm streetscapes.v.Buildings shall incorporate traditional horizontal elements such as building bases, sills, cornices and rooflines to add interest, reduce the massive scale of the building and complement the character of adjacent buildings.vi.Rooftop and ground floor mechanical equipment shall be screened from public view from right-of-way and adjacent buildings.vii.Screening through landscaping or appropriate fencing is required for all storage, service portals, garbage areas, and service driveways that are adjacent to other properties.viii.A variety of materials and exterior treatments are encouraged.d.Vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent current and future uses should be incorporated in the initial site planning stages. Driving aisles and vehicular access routes should be designed as extensions of the public realm, with connections to adjacent roads, sidewalks connecting to public sidewalks, curbs, street furniture and protective landscaping.e.Access points shall be consolidated, organized and clearly marked to minimize pedestrian, bicycle and auto conflicts.f.Parking lots.i.Parking lots should be laid out to continue the street/block pattern of the area so that the lots can easily be redeveloped with buildings consistent with the urban design of the surrounding development.ii.Large surface parking lots shall be screened and broken up visually through landscaping and other elements within the parking area, such as a grid of trees on islands in the parking lot or segmenting the lot with landscaped areas, as well as utilizing defined walkways.iii.Direct, defined and protected pedestrian routes should be provided through parking lots.iv.Landscaped islands should be placed at the ends of each of double row parking bays.v.Lots shall be designed to screen parked cars from the public sidewalk with low, dense planting; a low wall; trees; retaining walls to lower the grade of the lot; or a combination of the above.g.Convenient bicycle parking should be provided for employees and customers adjacent to the front doors of the building where possible.2.Large buildings should be articulated (broken into smaller components; avoiding facade flatness; with projections or indentations; with clearly marked and well designed entries; with differentiation between bottom floor, top floor, and the floors in between; and with a variety of roof designs).3.The scale, massing, articulation, orientation, and architectural features of structures to be located adjacent to State Highway 121 should provide a transition between State Highway 121 and the developments to the north.B.Area and bulk regulations. Development within the commercial/employment center zone is generally allowed to be conventional in design. As such, development of property in the commercial/employment center zone shall conform to the special regulations section of the city zoning Ordinance 1270, as amended, in addition to the REC overlay standards herein applicable to property in the commercial/employment center zone. When Ordinance 1270 is applicable, the following additional standards shall also apply: Lot widths shall be a minimum of 50 feet; lot coverage shall be a maximum of 70 percent except that the lot coverage may be increased as part of site plan approval if structured parking is provided; and building setback lines shall be at least 20 feet along SH 121 and Custer Road. In case of any conflict, the REC overlay standards herein shall control over the standards in Ordinance 1270. Ordinance 1270 shall not be applicable in any respect if the property in the commercial/employment center zone is adjacent to or across the street from property within the Collin-McKinney Parkway corridor zone or the neighborhood zone; in which case, development of the property in the commercial/employment center zone shall conform to the area and bulk regulations and all other REC overlay standards of the respective Collin-McKinney Parkway corridor zone or the neighborhood zone.C.Connectivity, linkages and access.1.Districts shall utilize a simple and functional street layout that provides multiple options for moving between destinations and connecting to adjacent developments.2.The street and block designs therefore should continue the pattern utilized in the parkway corridor and the neighborhoods so that as the market changes over time, the districts can accommodate increased mixed-uses and achieve higher use land values.3.Streets should be interconnected throughout the district. The street layout, public spaces, and buildings in the district should be designed so as to create a coherent focus at a public place.4.For buildings containing retail or consumer services uses, covered walkways should be utilized to link sidewalks/bus stops with buildings if the buildings are not placed on the set-to line.5.Pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided at all intersections.6.On-street parking shall be provided on every street where feasible.D.Public spaces.1.Districts shall provide defined public places and activity centers. This can be accomplished by the utilization of greens, plazas and streets fronted by closely adjacent buildings to provide interest at the pedestrian level.2.Proportions of squares and plazas should have a ratio between space width and adjacent building heights of 1:1 to 1:3. This ratio should not exceed 1:6.VII.REC base zoning districts.
The base zoning districts set forth the purpose of each specific district. Permitted uses within each REC base zoning district are set forth in the REC schedule of uses.

The REC overlay design standards and guidelines address site design, area and bulk regulations, lot and building types, connectivity, open space, land use mix and allocation, and compatibility through urban design.

The director of planning shall make a determination if a use not referenced in the REC schedule of uses can reasonably be interpreted to fit into a use category where similar uses are described. Interpretations may be ratified by the city council upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission at a regularly scheduled meeting. It is the intent of this provision to group compatible land uses into specific base zoning districts, either as permitted uses or as uses authorized by a specific use permit. Compatibility of uses within a particular base district is also facilitated by the urban design standards and guidelines provided in the REC overlay. Uses not listed as a permitted or specific use permit shall be presumed to be prohibited from the applicable base zoning district. In the event that a particular use is not listed in the REC schedule of uses for a given base district, and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by law, the director of planning shall determine whether a materially similar use exists in REC schedule of uses for a given base district. Should the director of planning determine that a materially similar use does exist, the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the director's decision shall be recorded in writing. Should the director of planning determine that a materially similar use does not exist, the matter shall be processed in accordance with section 146-43.

Notes:

(1)See district regulations.(2)Established by ordinance.(3)A ten-foot encroachment zone shall be permitted between the building setback and the property line within which porches, patios, and similar structures may be constructed. For the purposes of this section, porches and patios shall mean covered, open air recreation spaces which may or may not feature railings and/or low walls (approximately 30" to 40" in height as measured from the finished floor level of the space) to create a sense of enclosure. Covered, open air spaces that feature floor to ceiling walls with or without windows or other openings (example: sun rooms, sun porch, solarium, greenhouse) shall not constitute a porch or patio. The placement of sidewalks and/or steps leading to a porch, patio or similar structure shall not be regulated by this section.(4)The mean and median lot size for the neighborhood shall be a minimum of 7,200 square feet.(5)The density may be increased to 3.4 dwelling units per acre if the "design for density" criteria outlined in the city's comprehensive plan are satisfied.(6)Garages that are accessed from the front of a lot with a width of less than 50 feet shall not be permitted. Garages for these lots (< 50' wide) shall be accessed via alleys adjacent to the rear of the lot. A driveway with a minimum depth of 20 feet shall be provided in front of the rear-entry garage door.(7)Rear or corner side-entry garages shall adhere to a 20' building setback in order to accommodate a 20' driveway between the garage door and the alley or street right-of-way.(8)The maximum building height may be increased to a maximum height of 75 feet if each building setback is increased by two feet for every foot of increased building height. The maximum building height may be increased to a maximum height of 180 feet if each building setback is increased by two feet for every foot of increased building height and a property zoned or used for residential purposes is not located within 1,000 feet of the subject property.(9)If detached single family residential uses are constructed within this zoning district, said uses shall adhere to the space limits governing the "SF5" - Single Family Residential district.(10)A minimum building separation of ten feet shall be maintained between dwelling units. If a zero-lot line product is to be constructed, the desired zero lot line side of each lot indented to accommodate such a residential product shall be indicated on an approved record plat, minor plat, minor replat, or amending plat which shall be filed for record with the Collin county clerk's office.The following is a legend for interpreting the applicability of the various zoning districts:
These zoning districts were created on March 4, 2014. Properties zoned/rezoned after March 4, 2014 may be zoned to these districts.
These zoning districts were established prior to March 4, 2014. Properties zoned/rezoned after March 4, 2014 may be zoned to these districts.
These zoning districts were established prior to March 4, 2014. No properties may be zoned/rezoned to these districts after July 1, 2014.

Section G-2. - MTC McKinney Town Center Zoning District.	
1.PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The "MTC"McKinney Town Center zoning district is intended to implement the Town Center Study Phase 1 Report and associated illustrative vision (known together as the "Town Center Master Plan") adopted by City Council in March 2008. It facilitates pedestrian oriented, mixed-use, urban infill redevelopment, providing shopping, employment, housing, and business and personal services.

This is achieved by promoting an efficient, compact and walkable development pattern; encouraging pedestrian activity; reducing the reliance on private automobiles; positioning the historic Town Center as a viable transit-oriented development (TOD); promoting a more functional and attractive community through the use of recognized and time-tested principles of urban design; and allowing developers flexibility in land use and site design. A high level of attention to site and building design is required to promote an attractive and functional Town Center as envisioned in the Master Plan.

While revitalization of the historic Town Center area is a high priority, it must be accomplished in a manner that preserves and perpetuates the history and heritage of this community. It is the City's goal to enhance the significance of the City's authentic core to residents, tourists and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business and industry.

The McKinney Town Center zoning district is created to support economic development, sustainable tax base, and job creation/retention by: (a) providing a streamlined and simplified zoning process, (b) establishing adjacency predictability in the built environment, (c) offering flexibility to address changing market conditions, (d) reducing risk to private investment/development, (e) synchronizing private investment/development with public capital investment policies, and (f) calibrating zoning regulations with the existing physical context and character of the downtown core area of McKinney.

2.COMPONENTS.2.1The "MTC"McKinney Town Center zoning district shall apply to the geographical boundaries as established in the McKinney Town Center Regulating Plan.2.2The Regulating Plan shall be the official Zoning Map for the McKinney Town Center. It shall establish the development standards for all properties within the McKinney Town Center including:2.2.1Character Districts: The McKinney Town Center is further distinguished by "Character Districts." A Character District is intended to preserve and/or create an urban form that is distinct from other Character Districts. Each Character District shall establish use and building standards including but not limited to building placement, height, parking, service access, and other functional design standards for all properties within that Character District. The Regulating Plan classifies all properties within the Town Center into one of seven Character Districts (Historic Core; Downtown Core; Downtown Edge; Transit Village Core; Transit Village Edge; Cotton Mill Core; and Cotton Mill Edge). The different Character Districts are based on historic and regional architectural traditions and development intended to create a built environment that is consistent with the adopted Town Center Master Plan.2.2.2Street Designations: The Regulating Plan shall identify existing streets within the McKinney Town Center as Pedestrian Priority "A" Streets, Pedestrian Priority "B" Streets, or Service Streets. In addition, it shall identify the location and the level of pedestrian priority for recommended new streets as well as the location of streets recommended for vacation.2.2.3Special Requirement: The Regulating Plan shall identify the location of Required Commercial Frontage.2.2.4Other: The Regulating Plan shall identify existing civic building sites and existing civic/open spaces and shall recommend the location of future civic building sites, civic/open spaces, passenger rail station/platform, and vista termini within the McKinney Town Center.2.3McKinney Town Center zoning district text: The McKinney Town Center zoning district text (i.e., this document) shall enumerate the use and development standards with text and graphics including but not limited to Definitions, Administration, Permitted Uses, Building Form and Site Development Standards, Building Design Standards, and Open Space Standards relating to the regulation of private development within the McKinney Town Center.2.4The zoning regulations of general application, which apply across zoning districts, within the City of McKinney Zoning Regulations (Chapter 146), as amended, shall not apply to the ""MTC"McKinney Town Center Zoning District except as specifically referenced herein or unless the subject matter of any such zoning regulation of general application is not specifically addressed in this document and such zoning regulation is not otherwise in conflict with the spirit and intent of the "MTC"  McKinney Town Center Zoning District's regulations.3.REGULATING PLAN.
The Regulating Plan is hereby adopted as the official Zoning Map for the McKinney Town Center zoning district. The development standards in the McKinney Town Center zoning district shall apply mandatorily to all properties within the geographical boundaries of the McKinney Town Center Regulating Plan (see Appendix G-l of the City of McKinney Zoning Regulations (Chapter 146).

3.1Character Districts Established: The following Character Districts are established, and the boundaries of the specific Character Districts are established in the Regulating Plan. Per the standards for minor modifications in Section 5.5, the McKinney Town Center Development Coordinator shall have the authority to make minor adjustments to internal boundaries of the Character Districts as established in the Regulating Plan.3.1.1Historic Core: The Historic Core District is intended to preserve and enhance the existing National Register Commercial Historic District in and around the Historic Square. Development standards in this district require new buildings and additions to existing buildings to be consistent with the historic form and architectural traditions of the area.3.1.2Downtown Core: The Downtown Core District is intended to encourage compatible infill and redevelopment of the area immediately surrounding the Historic Core. Development standards in this district emphasize a pedestrian orientation and street walls along Virginia, Louisiana, Hunt, Lamar, Davis, Anthony, Church, Kentucky, Tennessee, Chestnut, and McDonald Streets.3.1.3Downtown Edge: The Downtown Edge District is intended to provide for a range of relatively smaller scale commercial (retail, office, and live-work) and residential transitions between the Downtown Core and the adjacent neighborhoods to the north, south, and west. Development standards emphasize keeping a smaller scale for residential uses and limiting non-residential building forms to be compatible with the adjacent residential neighborhoods.3.1.4Transit Village Core: The Transit Village Core District is intended to provide the highest intensity of residential and commercial infill and redevelopment around the future passenger rail transit station. Development standards emphasize pedestrian frontages along Virginia, Louisiana, and McDonald Streets.3.1.5Transit Village Edge: The Transit Village Edge District is intended to provide for a range of commercial (retail, office, cottage industrial and live-work) uses and sensitive building scale transitions between the Transit Village Core and the adjacent residential neighborhoods. Development standards emphasize transitioning the area from existing heavier industrial uses to buildings, uses, forms, and/or scales that are more compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods and are more complementary to the Transit Village Core.3.1.6Cotton Mill Core: The Cotton Mill Core District is intended to provide for adaptive reuse/redevelopment of the historic Cotton Mill building complex as well as for development of compatible new buildings with a flexible range of commercial, institutional, or residential uses based on specific market conditions. The mix of uses and development standards are based on the McKinney Economic Development Alliance's (MEDA) 2010-11 economic development study specifically identifying the Cotton Mill area as an opportunity for a technology business development center (i.e. "Entrepreneurial Village") to foster a unique, inspiring, and collaborative built environment that incubates emerging entrepreneurs and technologists.3.1.7Cotton Mill Edge: The Cotton Mill Edge District is intended to provide for a range of commercial (retail, office, cottage industrial and live-work) uses and sensitive building scale transitions between the Cotton Mill Core and the adjacent residential neighborhoods. Development standards emphasize buildings, uses, forms, and/or scales that are more compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods and are more complementary to the Cotton Mill Core.3.2Street Designations Established: The Regulating Plan establishes the following Street Designations for existing streets.3.2.1Pedestrian Priority "A" Streets: Pedestrian Priority "A" Streets are intended to be the primary pedestrian streets, and building frontages along Pedestrian Priority "A" Streets shall be held to the highest standard of pedestrian-oriented design. Any requirement for Pedestrian Priority "A" Streets fronting on Recommended Civic/Open Space shall be dependent on the actual location of the Civic/Open Space recommended.3.2.2Pedestrian Priority "B" Streets: Pedestrian Priority "B" Streets are intended to balance pedestrian orientation with automobile orientation. Building frontages along Pedestrian Priority "B" Streets may be permitted to accommodate some service and auto-related functions.3.2.3Service Streets: Service Streets are intended to provide service and auto-related functions such as loading/unloading and trash pick-up. Building frontages and lot frontages along Service Streets may be designed based on utility and functionality over pedestrian orientation. Service Streets may include existing or future alleys.3.2.4Street Vacations: The Street Vacation designation indicates the location of streets recommended for vacation by the City of McKinney and for reclamation by private development.3.3Street Designations Recommended: The Regulating Plan indicates the location and the level of pedestrian priority for recommended new streets intended to implement the Town Center Master Plan.3.4Special Requirement: The Regulating Plan indicates the location of Required Commercial Frontage along all streets fronting on the Historic Square. Ground floors of all buildings with this requirement shall not be occupied by residential units and/or lodging rooms in hotels to a minimum depth of 25 feet as measured from the front building façade line.3.5Other:3.5.1Existing Civic Building Sites: The Existing Civic Building Sites designation indicates the location of existing civic buildings (public and community buildings).3.5.2Existing Civic/Open Space: The Existing Civic/Open Space designation indicates the location of existing civic/open spaces (including parks, plazas, greens, and squares).3.5.3Recommended Civic Building Sites: The Recommended Civic Building Sites designation indicates the recommended location of future civic buildings (public and community buildings) intended to implement the Town Center Master Plan.3.5.4Recommended Civic/Open Space: The Recommended Civic/Open Space designation indicates the recommended location of future civic/open spaces (including parks, plazas, greens and squares) intended to implement the Town Center Master Plan. Any requirement for Pedestrian Priority "A" Streets fronting on Recommended Civic/Open Space shall be dependent on the actual location of the Civic/Open Space recommended.3.5.5Recommended Passenger Rail Station/Platform: The Recommended Passenger Rail Station/Platform designation indicates the recommended location of the future passenger rail station/platform intended to implement the Town Center Master Plan.3.5.6Recommended Vista Terminus: The Recommended Vista Terminus designation indicates the recommended location of vista termini at the end of key streets or view corridors intended to implement the Town Center Master Plan. Special attention should be given to the design of new buildings and sites to take advantage of these vista termini.4.DEFINITIONS.
In addition to Definitions in Section 146-46 of the City of McKinney Zoning Regulations, the following terms shall have the corresponding interpretations for the McKinney Town Center zoning district.

McKinney Town Center Master Plan: In March 2008, the Town Center Study Phase 1 Report and associated illustrative vision were unanimously approved by City Council and adopted by reference into the City of McKinney Comprehensive Plan. Known together as the Town Center Master Plan, it serves as a meaningful policy guide for City officials, City staff, property owners, private developers, and citizens when considering development/redevelopment decisions in the Town Center. The Town Center Study Phase 1 Report includes a number of preferred redevelopment concepts such as encouraging adaptive reuse of historic buildings, encouraging new mixed use and urban residential infill growth, improving pedestrian walkability and connectivity, creating compatible physical scales and transitions, and fostering long-term economic development through the concept of "place." The associated illustrative vision is a composite of several building scale illustrations of preferred redevelopment concepts.

McKinney Town Center Regulating Plan (Regulating Plan) is the official Zoning Map for the McKinney Town Center zoning district. The Regulating Plan graphically depicts development standards including Character Districts, Street Designations, and Special Requirement(s) applicable to properties within the McKinney Town Center geographical area.

Development standards will emphasize the redevelopment in keeping with the scale and historic significance of the area.

Generally, this character district may accommodate commercial or mixed use buildings in addition to requiring a minimum of 2 story building heights along the Historic Square frontage. Remodeling of existing historic buildings shall meet standards in Section 146-97 of the McKinney Zoning Regulations. The goal is to keep the blocks around the square viable for boutique and destination retail, restaurant, entertainment and civic uses that complement one another.

7.2Downtown Core.7.2.1Illustrations and Intent.
Note: The images and graphics on this page are provided as illustrations of intent and are advisory only without the power of law. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the specific Building Form and Site Development Standards.

The Downtown Core building form and site development standards are intended to encourage the redevelopment of the blocks immediately surrounding the Historic Core based on the Town Center Master Plan. Development standards will emphasize the redevelopment of these blocks to support a mix of commercial and residential uses in a walkable urban form.

The Downtown Core blocks have the most potential for new development due to a significant amount of vacant or underutilized properties. In addition, the Master Plan shows preferred conceptual locations for parking structures and surface parking lots. These conceptual locations assume build-out of the plan as well as realization of the market economics of the build-out density. The location of parking structures should not preclude other locations. The preferred conceptual locations, however, provide guidance as to how parking structures should be scaled and sited relative to adjacent buildings and how they can provide shared parking opportunities.

7.3Downtown Edge7.3.1Illustrations and Intent.
Note: The images and graphics on this page are provided as illustrations of intent and are advisory only without the power of law. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the specific Building Form and Site Development Standards.

The Downtown Edge building form and site development standards are intended to encourage the redevelopment of the blocks between the Downtown Core and existing residential neighborhoods. Development standards will emphasize the transition of these blocks from the higher intensity of the Downtown Core to the lower intensity building types of the adjoining residential neighborhoods.

Townhomes and live-work units would be utilized within the Downtown Edge District to facilitate a transition of uses from commercial to noncommercial and a lessening of intensity in terms of residential building types. And, finally, cottages in several site configurations are depicted to complete the transition around the Downtown Core.

The Downtown Edge standards emphasize the retention of existing residential building types while allowing for limited commercial and a range of urban residential uses.

TRANSIT VILLAGE EDGE CHARACTER DISTRICT

7.5Transit Village Edge.7.5.1Illustrations and Intent.
Note: The images and graphics on this page are provided as illustrations of intent and are advisory only without the power of law. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the specific Building Form and Site Development Standards.

The Transit Village Edge building form and site development standards implement the recommendations of the Town Center Master Plan for the blocks around the Transit Village Core. The standards emphasize the reuse of existing buildings, re-establishing a walkable street grid, and allowing for an eclectic mix of building types and uses from residential to cottage and light industrial uses.

The Transit Village Edge acts as the transition from the higher intensity Transit Village Core to the existing residential neighborhoods north and south of the Town Center and the rail station area. One of the key concepts is the potential redevelopment of the Cotton Compress site as a cultural and educational institution.

COTTON MILL CORE CHARACTER DISTRICT

7.6Cotton Mill Core.7.6.1Illustrations and Intent.
Note: The images and graphics on this page are provided as illustrations of intent and are advisory only without the power of law. Refer to the standards on the following pages for the specific Building Form and Site Development Standards.

The Cotton Mill Core District standards are intended to implement the recommendations for an Entrepreneurial Village at this location. It is intended to take advantage of its regional location, access to SH 5, proximity to the airport, and the historic Cotton Mill buildings.

The Cotton Mill Core would anchor the area, serving as a de facto incubator for emerging technology firms. The land around the mill could be developed to house "graduates" of the Cotton Mill who need more space but want to stay in the area and in a similar space. The main goal is to preserve the historic architecture of the Cotton Mill and facilitate its adaptive reuse, while at the same time creating a modern environment suitable for high tech businesses.

The concept plan shows a walkable "campus" of general office buildings that could support some small-service retail as well as additional space that support the large events within the Cotton Mill building. Higher density residential and civic/open space should be used to buffer the campus from the residential neighborhoods.
