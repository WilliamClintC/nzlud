1.25.030 Notice to correct violation.
A. Authority to Issue. 
    1. Whenever the code enforcement official or other authorized enforcement official, or his/her designee, determines that a violation is occurring or has occurred, he/she may issue a notice to correct the violation, in a form pursuant to subsection C of this section, to the property owner(s) and/or tenant(s) and/or to any person(s) causing or allowing or participating in the violation.
    2. If a notice to correct the violation has been issued, the code enforcement official shall require the violation to be corrected within one to 15 working days from the issuance of the notice to correct. The length of time to correct shall be determined, in the sole discretion of the code enforcement official or other authorized enforcement official, or his/her designee, by the scope of violation, the history of prior violations by the same persons and/or at the same location and method needed to correct violation. All violations, in any event, shall be corrected expediently.
B. Receipt of Correction Notice. 
    1. Upon receipt of notice to correct violation, the violator shall either correct the violation or ask the code enforcement official for a reconsideration of the notice to correct within the time frame set out in subsection (B)(3) of this section.
    2. If the violator corrects the violation, the code enforcement official shall close the violation file and notify violator of compliance.
    3. The property owner and/or tenant may request reconsideration of the notice to correct violation by the code enforcement official. This request must be made in writing prior to the date on which corrections are to be completed as specified in the notice. The code enforcement official shall respond to the request for reconsideration, if timely received, no later than seven calendar days from the date the request for reconsideration was received. The code enforcement official may amend the notice (a) to correct the notice, (b) for good cause to allow for a longer time to correct the violation, (c) to amend the scope of violation, or (d) to rescind the notice. A stay of the time allowed for correction shall be in effect from the date that a request for reconsideration was received, if timely received, until the date a response to the request for reconsideration is sent.
    4. If the violator corrects the violation pursuant to the reconsideration determination, the code enforcement official shall close the violation file and notify the violator of compliance.
C. Content. The notice to correct violation shall contain the following:
    1. The name and address of the property owner and/or tenant and/or other person to whom the notice to correct violation is directed; and
    2. The street address or description sufficient for identification of the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation has occurred or is occurring; and
    3. A description of the violation and a reference to the Auburn City Code or related provision, standard, regulation, procedure or permit which has been violated; and
    4. A statement of the action required to be taken to correct the violation as determined by the code enforcement official and a date or time by which correction is to be completed; and
    5. A statement that the property owner and/or tenant may request a reconsideration of the notice to correct violation by the code enforcement official and the procedures required for such request; and
    6. A statement that the consequences of failing to correct the violation may result in monetary penalties and/or other enforcement requirements; and
    7. A statement that the person to whom the notice to correct violation is directed shall inform the code enforcement official of the correction so an inspector can be sent to the violation premises to confirm the correction.
D. Service of Notice. The code enforcement official shall cause the notice to correct violation to be served on the person(s) to whom it is directed by personal service or by mailing a copy of the notice to correct violation by regular mail, postage prepaid, to such person(s) at his/her last known address. If the person’s address is unknown, service shall be completed by mailing the notice to the address of the most recent payer of the property tax for the property, as shown in the county’s records, and by posting a copy of the notice to correct violation conspicuously on the affected property or structure. Mailed notices shall be deemed received three business days after the postmark.
E. Extension. Upon written request received prior to the correction date or time, the code enforcement official may extend the date set for correction for good cause. The code enforcement official may consider but is not limited to the consideration of substantial completion of the necessary correction or unforeseeable circumstances which render completion impossible by the date established as good cause.
F. Repeat Violations. Notwithstanding the above provisions, in the case of a repeat violation, the code enforcement official or other authorized enforcement official, or his/her designee, may issue a notice of infraction regardless of whether a notice to correct violation has been issued. For the purposes hereof, “repeat violation” means that the same person or property has been the subject of one or more notice to correct violation within the preceding 12 months. (Ord. 6708 § 1, 2018; Ord. 6615 § 5, 2016; Ord. 5966 § 3, 2006; Ord. 5677 § 2, 2002; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. B), 1999; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. B), 1999; Ord. 4460 § 1, 1991.)

1.25.035 Stop work order.
Whenever any work is being done or any activity is occurring which constitutes a “violation” under ACC 1.25.020(G), the code enforcement official may order the work or activity stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in the doing or causing of such work to be done or such activity to occur, and any such persons shall forthwith stop such work and/or prevent such activity until authorized by the code enforcement official or designee to proceed with the work or recommence the activity. The issuance of a stop work order is not a prerequisite for the issuance of a notice of infraction or a citation for a violation. However, it shall be a misdemeanor punishable as provided in ACC 1.24.010 for a person to willfully engage in the doing or causing of such work to be done after the issuance of a stop work order, until authorized by the code enforcement official or designee to proceed with the work or recommence the activity. (Ord. 5966 § 6, 2006.)

1.25.040 Notice of infraction.
Notwithstanding the provisions of ACC 1.25.030, whenever the code enforcement official determines that a violation has occurred, he/she shall be authorized to issue a notice of infraction to the property owner(s) and/or tenant(s) and/or to any person(s) causing or allowing or participating in the violation. If a violation occurs outside the official’s presence, the official shall file, according to the process described in RCW 7.80.050, a notice of infraction with the court of limited jurisdiction for Auburn for the court to issue to the person(s). If a violation occurs in the official’s presence, the official may issue the notice of infraction either directly to the person(s) or by filing it with the court, according to RCW 7.80.050. Once issued, the infraction shall be processed for court proceedings in accordance with applicable rules and procedures. (Ord. 6708 § 2, 2018; Ord. 6429 § 3, 2012; Ord. 5677 § 2, 2002; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. B), 1999; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. B), 1999; Ord. 4460 § 1, 1991.)

1.25.050 Penalties for infractions.
Unless otherwise specifically provided in connection with particular sections, chapters or titles of the city code, noncriminal violations of the city code shall be infractions and shall carry a maximum penalty of $250.00. Each day, location, violator and incident shall constitute a separate civil infraction. In addition to this amount, a court of competent jurisdiction may order a person found to have committed a civil infraction to pay restitution, including the city’s reasonable enforcement and abatement costs.
It is provided, however, that if the same violator has been found, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to have previously committed an infraction violation for the same or similar conduct three or more separate times, with the infraction violations occurring at the same location and involving the same or similar sections of ACC Titles 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17 or 18, or other similar code(s), any further violations shall constitute misdemeanors, punishable as provided in ACC 1.24.010. For the purposes hereof, it shall be prima facie evidence that the same violator has previously been found to have committed any infraction if a certified copy of the judgment, docket or other court document showing that such violation was found committed is filed with the court. (Ord. 6615 § 6, 2016; Ord. 5837 § 2, 2004; Ord. 5677 § 2, 2002.)

1.25.060 Uncorrected violations.
In addition to any other enforcement actions available to the city, if a violation on a parcel of property is not corrected within the specified time frame of the decision of the court then no further permits or approvals shall be issued by the city on the subject parcel until all violations have been corrected, or brought into compliance with the decision of the court. (Ord. 5966 § 4, 2006; Ord. 5837 § 3, 2004; Ord. 5677 § 2, 2002.)

1.25.065 Additional penalty and enforcement provisions.
A. Civil Penalty. In addition to any other enforcement actions available to the city, if the code enforcement official determines that a violation has not been corrected pursuant to ACC 1.25.030 within the time specified in the notice to correct violation or recurs within 60 days of remediation of the same violation, he/she is authorized to impose a civil penalty against the property owner on whose property the violation exists, and/or the person in possession of the property, and/or the person otherwise causing or responsible for the violation. The penalty shall be up to $500.00 for the first day and $100.00 per day for each additional full day the violation continues. In the event a violation is remediated but recurs within 60 days, the city may impose a penalty that is double that of the above listed penalty amounts. Each day on which a violation or recurrence thereof continues shall constitute a separate violation. If unpaid within 14 calendar days of becoming effective, each penalty shall constitute a lien against the property of equal rank with state, county, and municipal taxes.
B. Notice of Penalty. The penalty shall be imposed by serving a notice of penalty. Service of the notice shall be made upon all persons identified in the notice either personally or by mailing a copy of such order by regular mail, postage prepaid. If an address for mailed service cannot be ascertained, service shall be accomplished by posting a copy of the notice conspicuously on the affected property or structure. The initial penalty shall be effective and the recurring daily penalty shall commence on the date service is effective. Service by regular mail shall be effective five calendar days after the date of postmark, unless U.S. postal records show actual receipt prior to that date. If service is by personal service, service shall be deemed effective immediately. If service is made by posting, service shall be effective on the third day following the day the notice is posted. Recurring penalties shall become effective every 24 hours after midnight of the effective date of the initial penalty if the violation is not corrected.
The notice shall contain all the information required to be placed in a notice to correct violation, under ACC 1.25.030, and in addition the following:
    1. The amount of the initial penalty and the amount of the per day penalty for each day the violation(s) continues, and, if applicable, the conditions on which assessment of such civil penalty is contingent.
    2. A statement that the recurring penalty accrues each day automatically, without further notice.
    3. The procedure for appealing the penalty, as described in this chapter.
    4. That if the penalties are unpaid within 10 days of when they become effective, they shall become a lien on the property that shall be of equal rank with state, county and municipal taxes.
C. Withdrawal. The code enforcement officer may withdraw a notice of penalty if compliance is achieved, as determined by the officer, within 14 calendar days of the service date of the notice. The officer shall not withdraw a notice of penalty if it is the second notice issued by the officer to the same person for the same or similar violation committed within six months.
D. Continued Duty to Correct. Payment of a penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve a person of the duty to correct the violation as ordered by the enforcement officer. Correction of the violation does not relieve a person of the obligation to pay the penalty assessed, unless dismissed, withdrawn, or modified by the hearing examiner or the code enforcement officer.
E. Appeal of Notice of Penalty. 
    1. An assessed civil penalty may be appealed to the city hearing examiner within 14 calendar days of the penalty’s effective date, in the same manner as determinations of the building official are appealed under ACC 15.07.130. After the 14-day period, penalties shall be final and binding. The hearing examiner may grant an extension of time for filing an appeal if the person establishes that he/she did not receive the notice of penalty due to good cause. The burden of proving such good cause circumstances is on the person making the claim.
    2. The appeal shall be processed and the hearing conducted according to the provisions of ACC 15.07.130 and the provisions of that section are adopted by reference for the purpose of this chapter. The person appealing may appeal either the determination that a violation exists or the amount of the civil penalty imposed, or both. The person appealing may appeal all penalties that are not final and binding. The hearing examiner has the authority to affirm, dismiss, or modify the civil penalty. The city shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the commission of a violation. If the hearing examiner finds that a violation was not committed at the time the notice of penalty was issued, the examiner shall dismiss all penalties before him/her that were imposed for the alleged violation and the city shall dismiss all additional penalties, whether effective or final, that were imposed for the alleged violation.
    3. The civil penalties for a continuing violation shall not continue to accrue pending determination of the appeal; however, the hearing examiner may impose a daily monetary penalty, to a maximum of $100.00 per day, from the date of service of the notice of penalty if the hearing examiner finds that the appeal is frivolous or intended solely to delay compliance. An appeal does not lift or stay a notice to correct violation.
    4. A person is precluded from appealing a penalty if the hearing examiner finds that it has determined in a prior appeal all the issues of fact and law raised by the person appealing.
    5. At his/her discretion, the hearing examiner may consolidate appeals of penalties imposed on the same property for the same violations.
F. Cost Recovery and Lien. 
    1. Any monetary penalty imposed under this chapter constitutes a personal obligation of the person served the notice of penalty. The city attorney is authorized to collect the monetary penalty by use of appropriate legal remedies, the seeking of which shall neither stay nor terminate the accrual of additional per-day penalties so long as the violation continues.
    2. The city may authorize the use of collection agencies to recover monetary penalties, in which case the cost of the collection process shall be assessed in addition to the monetary penalty.
    3. Once civil penalties are effective and due, pursuant to this section, the code enforcement officer may file a lien with the county auditor on the property where the violation exists for the amount of the unpaid civil penalties. The lien shall be of equal rank with state, county and municipal taxes, and shall be in similar form, be filed with the same county office, be enforced and foreclosed in the same manner, and subject to the same exemptions as state law provides for the foreclosure of labor and material liens. The claim of lien shall contain the following:
        a. The authority for imposing a civil penalty;
        b. A brief description of the civil penalty imposed, including the violations charged and the duration thereof;
        c. A legal description of the property to be charged with the lien;
        d. The name of the known or reputed owner; and
        e. The amount, including lawful and reasonable costs, for which the lien is claimed. (Ord. 6708 § 3, 2018; Ord. 6647 § 2, 2017; Ord. 6615 § 7, 2016; Ord. 6328 § 4, 2010.)

2.22.040 Permits – Assemblies, entertainment, etc.
Any person who conducts or participates in any organized entertainment, demonstration, or public gathering in any park shall obtain a permit from the director. The procedure for application and consideration of permits for this purpose is as follows:
A. Any person seeking to obtain a permit shall file a written application with the director no later than one month prior to the date of the proposed use. The application shall state the purpose for which the park would be used, the date and time of the proposed use, the name of the park and the area thereof that would be used, the anticipated number of persons who would be present, and such other information reasonably relating to the contemplated use as the director may require; provided, however, that said director may, for good cause shown, waive the one-month requirement for filing said application.
B. When the proposed use is an exercise of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, or Article I, Section 3, 4, 5, or 11 of the Washington Constitution, the application shall be processed promptly, without charging a fee for political or religious activities other than a fee based on the cost of processing the application, or imposing terms or conditions that infringe constitutional freedoms, and in a manner that respects the liberties of applicants and the public.
C. In reviewing an application under this section, the director shall consider the following conditions and standards:
    1. The size of the park and any specialized purpose for which it is normally used or for which specialized facilities have been provided;
    2. The location of the park, its aesthetic character and physical characteristics, and the character of the area surrounding it;

D. If, under the conditions set forth in subsection C of this section, the director finds after an investigation that the safety, comfort, and convenience of the public in the use of the parks, or in the usage of the area adjacent to the park, would be unduly disturbed, he or she may deny the application, may impose restrictions upon the permit, or may issue a permit for a different date, time, park, or park area so as to alleviate such burden.

(Ord. 6442 § 31, 2012; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987. Formerly 18.66.040.)

Participants appearing before the hearing examiner have the right, insofar as possible, to have the examiner free from personal interest or prehearing contacts on land use regulatory matters considered by him or her.

Unless otherwise required by the Auburn City Code, all hearings conducted by the examiner shall be open record hearings.

In the case of applications requiring city council approval, the examiner shall transmit his decision to the city council.
B. In extraordinary cases, the time period for filing of the recommendation or the decision of the examiner may be extended for not more than 20 working days after the conclusion of the hearing if the examiner finds that the amount and the nature of the evidence to be considered, or receipt of additional information which cannot be made available within the normal decision period, require the extension. Notice of the extension, stating the reasons therefor, shall be sent to all parties of record in the manner set forth in this section for notification of the examiner’s decision.
C. Conditions. When acting on land use matters, the examiner’s recommendation or decision may be to grant or deny the application, or the examiner may require of the applicant such conditions, modifications and restrictions as the examiner finds necessary to make the application compatible with the environment and carry out the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan, this title, the land division ordinance, other codes and ordinances of the city of Auburn, and the approved preliminary plat, if applicable.

(1957 code § 1.21.060.)

2.54.100 Travel expense account – Establishment – Funding.
Upon receipt of moneys, the city finance director will open a checking account in the local bank in the name of the city, entitled the “travel expense account.” Moneys received from the following sources will be deposited in the account: from the finance director or other disbursing officers in total amount originally established in the revolving fund or subsequently added thereto; from officers and employees representing funds of any unexpended advancement; from the check-issuing officer reimbursing the custodian for travel expenses allowed in the settlement of employee advances.

2.54.110 Travel expense account – Records and reconciliations.
A check register will be maintained in which shall be recorded all transactions of the fund, including deposits, disbursements and bank service charges.

The balance remaining in the checking account as of a given date, together with any outstanding advances and travel expense claims on hand but not yet reimbursed, should always equal the amount established by the city for the revolving fund. A monthly review of such disbursements and existing balance shall be made by the mayor. Information to conduct such review shall be presented monthly by the finance director. (Ord. 2920 § 1, 1976; 1957 code § 1.21.080.)

2.54.120 Travel expense advances – How made – Request requirements.
Employee advances for travel expenses will be made by the issuance of checks drawn on the special bank account payable to the applicant.

Requests for such advances shall be reasonable estimates of the applicant’s travel expense requirements and shall contain, as a minimum, the following information:
A. Date of request;
B. Name of applicant;
C. Destination;
D. Purpose of travel;
E. Anticipated departure and return dates;
F. Amount requested;
G. Signature of applicant;
H. Official approval of trip;
I. Check number, amount and date (to be provided by the custodian when advance is made). (1957 code § 1.21.090.)

2.54.130 Travel expense advances – Settlement.
A. Settlement of advances will be made on or before the tenth day following the close of the travel period by filing with the finance director an expense voucher as required by RCW 42.24.090. The finance director will verify the amount shown on such form as having been advanced to the employee. In the event the traveler’s actual expense is less than the amount received, his expense voucher will be accompanied by the unexpended portion of the advance. The expense voucher and original request for the advance will then be used to support the custodian’s claim for a check replenishing his revolving fund for the travel expenses reported. Expense vouchers containing expenses in the excess of the amount advanced will be submitted to the custodian at the time of final settlement. The expense claim and the traveler’s request for an advance will then be used to support the custodian’s claim for a check replenishing his revolving fund. The expense claim will be submitted to the check-issuing officer for reimbursement of the excess to the applicant. Claims for reimbursement to the fund should be submitted by the custodian of the fund periodically as needed and at the end of the fiscal year in order that all expenses incurred will be charged against the appropriations for the period then ending.
B. Any default in accounting for or repaying an advance shall render the full amount which is unpaid immediately due and payable with interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum from the date of default until repaid. To protect against any losses on advances, the governing body shall have a prior lien against and a right to withhold any and all funds payable or to become payable to such officer or employee to whom such advance has been given, up to the amount of the advance and an annual interest rate of 10 percent until repayment or justification is made (RCW 42.24.140). No advance of any kind may be made to any officer or employee at any time when he is delinquent in accounting for or repaying a prior advance.
C. Upon termination of the fund, all moneys remaining shall be returned to the city’s general fund. (Ord. 5087 § 2, 1998; Ord. 2921 §§ 2, 3, 1976.)

(Ord. 5757 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5264 § 2, 1999.)

2.92.010 Policy.
A. Purpose. The city council has adopted herein a code of ethics for city-elected officials and city-appointed officers and officials to promote public confidence in the integrity of local government and its fair operation. This code of ethics will provide the basis for education and training for city officials to ensure that the highest ethical standards and best ethical practices will be followed.
B. Intent. The citizens and businesses of Auburn are entitled to have fair, ethical and accountable local government that has earned the public’s full confidence. It is further the intent that city officials be permitted to fulfill their duties to represent the public to the greatest extent possible unless circumstances exist where such engagement is impermissible. Nothing in this chapter is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict the pool of available candidates for service on the council or service on council-appointed public bodies, all of which are either part-time or volunteer positions. It is in the public interest to ensure that the provisions of this chapter do not create barriers to citizen public service. In keeping with the city of Auburn’s commitment to excellence, the effective functioning of democratic government therefore requires that:
    1. Public officials, both elected and appointed, comply with the laws and policies affecting the operations of government;
    2. Public officials be independent, impartial and fair in their actions;
    3. Public office be used for the public good, not for personal gain;
    4. Public deliberations and processes be conducted openly, unless legally confidential, in an atmosphere of respect and civility; and
    5. There needs to be compatibility between city ethical codes and the ethic codes of state law. (Ord. 6519 § 1, 2014.)

2.92.020 Definitions.
A. “Official” means a city-elected official and a city-appointed official, officer or employee, and includes members of appointed city boards and commissions and other task forces, groups or committees.
B. “Quasi-judicial actions” means those actions of the city council/legislative body, planning commission, hearing examiner, or other city boards which determine the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties in a hearing or other contested case proceeding.
C. “Relative” means spouse, domestic partner, child, step-child, parent, step-parent, parent-in-law and sibling.
D. Definitions Incorporated by Reference. The definitions included in and referenced by RCW 42.23.020 and 42.52.010, as hereinafter amended, are incorporated herein unless the language and context hereof clearly excludes the application thereof; provided, that such definitions may nevertheless guide in the application and interpretation thereof. (Ord. 6519 § 1, 2014.)

2.92.030 Prohibited conduct.
A. Compliance with Ethics Laws. Officials shall comply with the individual conduct requirements of federal, state and city laws in the performance of their public duties. These laws include, but are not limited to: the United States and Washington Constitutions; laws pertaining to conflicts of interest, election campaigns, financial disclosures and open processes of government; and city ordinances and policies, including but not limited to the below list. Councilmembers shall also comply with the ethical, professional and courtesy requirements of the city of Auburn council rules of procedure.

    10. Chapter 42.52 RCW – Ethics in public service.
B. Gifts and Favors. Officials shall not knowingly use their public position to secure any special advantage, services or opportunities for personal or family gain, where such services, opportunities or gains are not available to the public in general. Officials may also not solicit or receive any thing of monetary value from any person or entity where the thing of monetary value has been solicited or received or given, or where it would appear to a reasonable person to have been solicited or received or given, with intent to give or obtain consideration or influence as to any action by the official in his or her official capacity; provided, that nothing shall prohibit campaign contributions which are solicited or received and reported in accordance with applicable law. They shall not accept or solicit any gifts, favors or promises of future benefits except as follows:
    1. No official may accept gifts, other than those specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section, with an aggregate value in excess of $50.00 from a single source in a calendar year, or a single gift from multiple sources with a value in excess of $50.00 in accordance with RCW 42.52.150(1); provided, that if the $50.00 limit in RCW 42.52.150(1) is amended, this section shall be deemed to reflect the amended amount. For purposes of this section, “single source” means any person, corporation, or entity, whether acting directly or through any agent or other intermediary. “Single gift” includes any event, item, or group of items used in conjunction with each other or any trip including transportation, lodging, and attendant costs.

    2. The following items are presumed not to influence the vote, action, or judgment of the official, or be considered as part of a reward for action or inaction, and may be accepted without regard to the limit established by subsection (B)(1) of this section:
        a. Unsolicited flowers, plants and floral arrangements;
        b. Unsolicited advertising or promotional items of nominal value, such as pens and note pads;
        c. Unsolicited tokens or awards of appreciation in the form of a plaque, trophy, desk item, wall memento, or similar item;
        d. Unsolicited items received by an official for the purpose of evaluation or review, if the official has no personal beneficial interest in the eventual use or acquisition of the item;
        e. Informational materials, publications or subscriptions related to the recipient’s performance of official duties;
        f. Food and beverages consumed at hosted receptions where attendance is related to the official’s duties for the city;
        g. Admission to, and the cost of food and beverages consumed at, events sponsored by or in conjunction with a governmental entity or organization;
        h. Unsolicited gifts from dignitaries from another state or a foreign country which are intended to be personal in nature; provided, that if the value (identified or estimated) exceeds $50.00, the gift shall be the property of the city’s;
        i. Food and beverages on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of meals where attendance by the official is related to the performance of official duties; and
        j. Any gift which would have been offered or given to the official if he or she were not an official.
    3. The presumption in subsection (B)(2) of this section is rebuttable and may be overcome based on the circumstances surrounding the giving and acceptance of the item.
C. The provisions of this section and of this chapter do not prohibit the city from funding, or contributing to the funding for, an event, activity, or function at which public officials attend and/or in which they participate, so long as the city council finds that there is a corresponding benefit to the city to have its public officials attend or participate, and where city council expressly approves funding, or the contribution towards funding thereof. For the purposes hereof, including the funding of an event, activity, or function in the approved city budget for applicable public officials constitutes a finding by the city council that there is a corresponding benefit to the city to have its public officials attend or participate in such event, activity, or function. (Ord. 6519 § 1, 2014.)

2.92.050 No right of action created – Effective date.
A. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as creating or providing a basis for a private cause of action against the city or against any official by third parties.
B. No retroactive application is intended by the adoption of this chapter which shall only apply to acts that occur after the effective date thereof. (Ord. 6519 § 1, 2014.)

A. The provisions of this chapter shall be enforceable in accordance with the statutory authority referenced herein.
B. Enforcement of a violation of this ethics code against a councilmember shall be reviewed by an ad hoc committee comprised of three members of the city council, which ad hoc committee shall make a recommendation to the city council. The ad hoc committee shall be created for this purpose when called for by the deputy mayor, and members of such ad hoc committee shall be appointed by the deputy mayor; provided, that the mayor shall act to call for the ad hoc committee and appoint members to such ad hoc committee if the deputy mayor is disabled or precluded from acting in that capacity.

2.97.010 Purpose and introduction.
A. The city may, from time to time, decide to install permanent monuments on city property to provide the city’s commemoration of persons or events of note, or to otherwise convey the city’s position on various topics (referred to as “government speech”). The city retains, in its sole discretion, the rights to control the message of monuments in its city parks and on its public property. An application form shall be available from the city clerk and from the parks department for use by private individuals, groups and entities who wish to request placement of monuments in city parks or on city property.
B. By placing monuments on city property, the city intends only to engage in government speech and does not intend to open a public forum for free speech activity.
C. The purpose of this chapter is to establish criteria and guidelines for the consideration and installation of monuments on city-owned property deemed by the city to be appropriate to serve as the site for a monument. In doing so, the city recognizes the following considerations:
    1. Monuments can convey a powerful connection between Auburn and its history, and in some instances its future.
    2. It is therefore important that the placement of monuments be limited to circumstances of the highest community-wide importance, both to maintain the significance of such monuments and to minimize conflicts with the active and variable use of public spaces.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may decide, in its sole discretion, to reject a proposal for a monument and/or may determine the appropriate site for any and all city monuments. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.020 Definitions.
A. The following definitions apply to this chapter:
    1. “Government speech” means the speech of the city per the doctrine addressed in Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 [1995] and cases relying thereon. Under this doctrine, when the city retains the power to control the message conveyed, the statements and expressive actions are government speech of the city even if it uses other persons or entities to communicate its messages.
    2. “Monument” means a marker, statue, or other similar permanent structures and installations to express government speech, as described and referenced in this chapter, and which are installed by the city on city property, or which are accepted by the city and installed on city property with city permission, and subject to the following:
        a. Monuments may be in various forms including statues, fountains, buildings, or gardens among other forms of monuments as determined by the city.
        b. Monuments do not include items dedicated in parks, such as benches, trees, small plaques (plaques not larger than five square feet in size), and other memorials with a dollar value that does not exceed $5,000, as determined by the estimated or anticipated cost of purchase or construction and installation or placement; provided, however, that if the monument requires a building permit, it shall be included in the definition of monuments.
        c. Monuments do not include memorial signs as defined in the city’s memorial sign program (Chapter 12.68 ACC).
B. In the event that a question arises as to whether a proposal falls within the scope of this chapter or these definitions, or if a question arises as to how the proposal falls within the scope hereof, the city council shall have the sole discretion to decide such questions and to make determinations relating thereto. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.030 Government speech on monuments.
A. City’s Government Speech Topics. The city may install or accept city-approved monuments on city property as a form of “government speech” as city recognition of significant events or people or to provide information from the city on topics approved by the city, as set forth below:
    1. The contributions of individuals or groups who made a substantial impact upon the city, the Auburn Community, King County, Pierce County, Washington State, or the United States;
    2. The city’s position on topics of interest to the community, as determined by the city council;
    3. The history of Auburn, the state of Washington, or of the United States;
    4. Historical or cultural influences on Auburn;
    5. Native flora, fauna and wildlife of Auburn and the greater Auburn Area – the area surrounding Auburn and regionally in the vicinity of Auburn;
    6. Local innovation or creativity that has contributed to Auburn’s growth and prosperity; or
    7. Other criteria selected by the city council and set forth in an amendment to this chapter.
B. The city shall not place monuments on city property which have the purpose of promoting, favoring or inhibiting any religion or which would appear to a reasonable person that the city is promoting, favoring, or opposing a religion. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.040 Administration.
A. The mayor may recommend to city council the approval or denial of monument proposals. The mayor may enact administrative guidelines and procedures to implement this chapter, including procedures for consideration of locations deemed amenable to monuments. The mayor shall also designate the lead department or departments for monuments located on city property depending on the proposed location of the monument and the potential impact to city departments.
B. Notwithstanding that certain city property is operated or managed by a private operator pursuant to an agreement, the evaluator of the monument and the final decision maker shall be the city council and not the private operator or manager.
C. The director of the lead department shall coordinate with the director of parks, art and recreation if there are any questions or issues as to whether a proposed monument is primarily public art, or whether it otherwise fits into the city’s public art programs. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.050 Donated and private funding of monuments.
A. In accordance with Chapter 2.87 ACC, the city encourages private donations to the city to support various city programs and city operations, which may include without limitation, the cost of acquisition, installation and maintenance of monuments on city property. The city prefers to receive private donations in the form of funds that may be used by the city to review, design, fabricate, acquire, install and/or maintain monuments, rather than the donation of a completed monument.
B. However, the city may from time to time, at city’s sole option, consider accepting a completed monument as a form of government speech; provided, that the monument meets the city’s approved government speech topics and also meets all of the other criteria set forth in this chapter and in any related administrative guidelines or procedures. After city council’s acceptance of a monument, which acceptance shall be through an appropriate process approved by the city council, and subject to city’s explicit approval of installation of the monument upon city property, title to the monument shall vest with city and the city may remove, relocate and shall otherwise have sole control over the monument.
C. While the city appreciates donations of monuments to the city, the city is under no obligation to accept any donated monument even if the monument meets, or could be said to meet, all of the criteria set forth in this chapter. The city’s decision to accept a donated monument may also depend upon the cost to the city of design, fabrication, installation and maintenance of the monument and site considerations, among other factors.
D. The city may, at its option, decide for budgetary reasons to prioritize monuments where the city expects to receive donated funding to cover the cost of design, fabrication, installation and maintenance of the monument. Unless otherwise agreed by city council, the donor of a proposed monument is responsible for providing the city with funds to cover the cost of review, design, fabrication, installation and maintenance to ensure adequate care for the monument. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.060 Review process.
A. The mayor or his or her designee shall provide the initial screening of monument proposals to determine if the proposed monument complies with the provisions of this chapter including without limitation, to evaluate the suitability of the proposed monument site, if any, so that a report and recommendation may be prepared for the city council in advance of its decision on the proposal. If the mayor’s decision is to conduct further review of the proposal based upon considerations consistent with this chapter, the proposal shall be referred to the appropriate department, so the report and recommendations to the council can address the considerations and criteria of this chapter.
B. The lead department shall prepare a report for consideration by the city council and such board or commission designated by the city council, if any, and shall coordinate with the mayor and with other affected departments. The lead department shall submit an advisory recommendation to the mayor for the mayor’s review regarding the monument based upon the factors set forth in this chapter and the review criteria set forth below. After the mayor’s review, and amendments and modifications (if any) the mayor shall then forward the recommendation to the city council.
C. The city council shall have final approval of a city project to design and construct a monument, or to accept a donated monument.
D. The mayor shall, on at least a quarterly basis, submit a report to the city council informing the city council of any and all monument donations and application proposals received by the city, and the mayor’s recommendations regarding each proposal.
E. All required environmental review shall be approved by the city’s planning department before the city commits to installing a monument. The monument shall be consistent with adopted city master plans unless those plans are amended as a part of the review process.
F. While a formal building permit is not required, the building official shall review the structure and site plan to ensure conformance with the building code adopted by Washington State.
G. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city council may decide, in its sole discretion, to reject a proposal for a monument and/or may determine the appropriate site for any and all city monuments.
H. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Auburn City Code, the process set forth in this chapter shall be the only city process for reviewing the siting or location of monuments. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.070 Review criteria.
A. A proposed monument must:
    1. Pass city safety and liability exposure review.
    2. Conform to the approved government speech topics.
    3. Be made of durable materials, able to withstand the elements for a minimum of 50 years with minimum maintenance.
    4. Be made of materials resistant to vandalism and graffiti as much as is reasonably possible.
    5. Be of a scale, materials, color and style appropriate and consistent with aesthetics of the proposed location of the monument and such other reasonable factors as the city determines, including but not limited to sight distance, safety, and other applicable requirements for structures as set forth in the Auburn City Code.
    6. Conform to the requirements of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) to ensure that there is a path that allows access to the monument.
    7. Conform to the adopted building code to ensure that the footing and monument are structurally adequate.
B. The city shall also consider whether:
    1. The person, group or event being memorialized is deemed by the city to have made a significant enough contribution to merit a monument of the scale, cost and visibility of the proposed monument.
    2. The monument duplicates existing monument themes. Multiple monuments for similar or related groups are disfavored.
    3. The monument proposal has been the subject of one or more public meetings conducted by the monument’s proponents. The public meeting shall be conducted in accordance with ACC 18.02.130.
    4. The proposed monument has the general support of the persons or community that the monument is intended to honor.
    5. The proposed site in the park or plaza for the monument is related to the underlying purpose of the monument or the site in the park or plaza has been designated in a master plan or other approval of the city council as a particularly appropriate site for a proposed monument.
    6. The monument has been designed by or under the direct supervision of a qualified professional in the art or design field, and provides a quality, scale, and character commensurate with the location, circulation, and use patterns of the city property. Qualified professionals include registered architects, engineers, landscape architects and artists who can demonstrate professional recognition in the form of public commissions or permanent public installations. The city may solicit input from such professionals, and from planners or urban designers in making this determination. Monuments shall not displace the intended function and/or use of said property, as articulated in adopted master plans or similar city documents.
    7. There is a committed and verifiable funding source for the review, design, fabrication, installation and maintenance of the monument before proceeding to incur city costs and staff time. The proponents of the monument agree to enter into an agreement to provide the city with funds that cover the cost of review, design, fabrication and installation, and an adequate endowment to cover the cost of the monument’s maintenance as determined by city. Alternatively, the city may consider accepting an agreement from a group to maintain a monument in perpetuity and in accordance to city standards rather than a cash endowment. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.080 Public right-of-way.
The public right-of-way shall not be considered as a site for monuments, except as provided for in Chapter 12.68 ACC. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

2.97.090 Other policies.
A. Nothing in this chapter is intended to supersede or limit any other city code sections or administrative policies, including, but not limited to the city’s policies and procedures for its art in public places programs, whether the art is privately or publicly funded, and the provisions of Ordinance No. 6243 (including Chapter 2.85 ACC) and Resolution Nos. 4546 (percent for art) and 4323 (integrated artwork), and the Auburn parks, arts and recreation department policies and procedures for gift acceptance and donor recognition.
B. This chapter does not cover temporary installations on city property, nor does it limit the city’s ability to place signage or plaques on city property to provide donor or sponsor recognition, public information regarding a city project, or to place historical markers or to provide other information to the public. (Ord. 6480 § 1, 2013.)

3.06.020     Identification of special funds.
3.06.030     Appropriation authority.
3.06.040     Amendments to capital budgets.

3.06.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a multi-year capital budgeting process, accommodating repurposing of certain moneys within special funds within the context of RCW 35A.34.270, and establishing guidelines for transferring moneys between projects within the same capital fund. (Ord. 6682 § 1, 2018.)

3.06.020 Identification of special funds.
The following funds will be designated as “special” funds within the context of RCW 35A.34.270: arterial street fund (fund 102), local street fund (fund 103), arterial street preservation fund (fund 105), recreational trails fund (fund 120), mitigation fees fund (fund 124), municipal parks construction fund (fund 321), capital improvements fund (fund 328), local revitalization fund (fund 330), water utility capital fund (fund 460), sewer utility capital fund (fund 461), storm drainage utility capital fund (fund 462), airport capital fund (fund 465), cemetery capital fund (fund 466), equipment rental capital fund (fund 560), and innovation and technology capital fund (fund 568). (Ord. 6682 § 1, 2018.)

3.06.030 Appropriation authority.
The mayor or designee is granted appropriation authority that is established for the duration of all projects within each special fund, as identified in ACC 3.06.020, or as may be hereinafter amended, and that amounts approved would not lapse and would remain without fiscal limitation until expended for the intended purpose or until unencumbered by a future ordinance. Any unspent appropriations at the end of the budget year would not lapse but would be carried over to the next budget year within the same fund without further council action. (Ord. 6682 § 1, 2018.)

3.06.040 Amendments to capital budgets.
That amendments to capital fund budgets would be initiated to appropriate new projects as approved by city council, to appropriate additional expenditures as a result of new funding and/or use of reserves, and to transfer funds between projects that have a similar purpose. Amendments that result in an increase in a fund’s total appropriation or that involve the transfer of any unexpended and unencumbered appropriation from one fund to another would require approval by city council. The transfer of any unexpended and unencumbered appropriation from one project to another within the same fund could be approved by the finance director; provided, that: (A) the funds will be used for a similar or like project; or (B) the original project is complete and unspent funds remain; or (C) a revised project estimate confirms that there will be savings in the original project upon completion; or (D) the purpose for which the funds were appropriated no longer exists and funds can be redirected as needed.

For all unbudgeted expenditures not individually and separately listed in the city’s annual budget in excess of $50,000, approval shall be obtained from the mayor and the city council.

Council action will be required to authorize amendments to contracts that are either not included in the budget or exceed the approved budget as follows:

C. Council action is required for the initial authorization of contracts for on-call services. For contracts solicited for a contract period of up to five years, each on-call contract may be amended by the mayor on an annual basis to extend the contract duration by up to one year for a total duration not to exceed the original solicited contract period and may be amended by the mayor to increase the contract amount by an amount equal to or less than the original contract amount authorized by the city council.

Where formal bidding is required, a call for bids shall be issued in accordance with the provisions herein before any contract is let for the performance of any public work.
B. Formal Advertising Procedures. For projects requiring formal advertisement per this section, a notice of a call for bids, stating the nature of the contract to be let and the time on or before which sealed bids for the same must be filed with the city clerk, shall be given by posting notice thereof on the bulletin board in the lobby of City Hall.

3.12.040 Rejection of bids.
The city shall have the power to reject any or all bids, to determine and to waive any irregularities or informalities that do not materially affect the substance of the bid itself, and to make further calls for bids in the same manner as the original call; or, if in its judgment the project can be done by the city at less cost than the lowest bid submitted, it may do so without making further call for bids or awarding any contract therefor. If no bid is received on the first call, the city may re-advertise and make a second call, or may enter into a contract by negotiation without further calls, or may purchase the supplies, material or equipment and perform such work or improvement with in-house forces. (Ord. 6545 § 1, 2014.)

B. Evidence of collusion exists with any other bidder or potential bidder. Participants in collusion will be restricted from submitting further bids; or
C. The bidder, in the opinion of the city, is not qualified for the work or to the full extent of the bid, or to the extent that the bid exceeds the authorized prequalification amount as may have been determined by a requalification of the bidder; or
D. An unsatisfactory performance record exists based on past or current contracting work for the city or for others, as judged from the standpoint of conduct of the work; workmanship; or progress; affirmative action; equal employment opportunity practices; termination for cause; of disadvantaged business enterprise, minority business enterprise, or woman’s business enterprise utilization; or
E. An unsatisfactory safety record exists based on past or current contracting work; or
F. There is uncompleted work, with the city or others, which in the opinion of the city might hinder or prevent the prompt completion of the work bid upon; or

K. More than one proposal is submitted for the same project by a bidder under the same or different names; or

Said security company in accordance with RCW 39.08.010 shall be bound by the laws of the state of Washington and subject to the jurisdiction of the state of Washington. The provisions of RCW 39.08.010 through 39.08.030 shall not apply to any money loaned or advanced to any such contractor, subcontractor or other person in the performance of any such work.
B. For contracts using the limited public works process, the city may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of Chapter 39.08 RCW and retainage requirements of Chapter 60.28 RCW, thereby assuming the liability for the contractor’s nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialmen, suppliers, and taxes imposed under RCW Title 82 that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project; however, the city shall have the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor’s behalf. The city engineer shall have the authority to waive the payment and performance bond requirements and retainage requirements based on his/her evaluation of the project and determination of risk.
C. On contracts of $150,000 or less, upon request by the contractor, the city may, in lieu of the bond, retain 10 percent of the contract amount for a period of 30 days after the date of final acceptance, or until receipt of all necessary releases from the Department of Revenue, Employment Security Department, and the Department of Labor and Industries, receipt of all affidavits of wages paid for the prime and subcontractors, and settlement of any liens filed under Chapter 60.28 RCW, whichever is later.
D. For the purposes of determining the time frame required for notices of claims against retainage and release of retainage, the city engineer shall have the authority to take affirmative action to determine that a contract is complete and to accept the contract work. (Ord. 6679 § 7, 2018; Ord. 6545 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5866 § 1, 2004; Ord. 4924 § 2, 1997; Ord. 4581 § 2, 1992. Formerly 3.12.040.)

        b. Whether the contractor performed the work promptly and within the time specified without delay or interference;
    2. Quality of the work;

B. A copy of the contractor evaluation form will be sent to the contractor and any contractor responses will be added to the evaluation. The contractor evaluation form may be used by the city to determine whether or not the contractor is a responsible bidder who should be considered for further public works projects.

A. The city need not comply with formal sealed bidding procedures for construction, building, renovation, remodeling, alteration, repair, or improvement of real property where the estimated cost does not exceed the current statutory limit in RCW 39.04.155, which includes the costs of labor, material, equipment, and sales and/or use taxes as applicable. Instead, the city may use the small works roster procedures for public works projects as set forth herein. The breaking of any project into units or accomplishing any projects by phases is prohibited if it is done for the purpose of avoiding the maximum dollar amount of a contract that may be let using the small works roster process.
B. Number of Small Work Rosters. The city may create a single general small works roster, or may create a small works roster for different specialties or categories of anticipated work. Said small works rosters may make distinctions between contractors based upon different geographic areas served by the contractor.
C. Contractors on Small Works Roster(s). The small works roster shall consist of all responsible contractors who have requested to be on the roster(s), and where required by law are properly licensed or registered to perform contracting work in the state of Washington. Contractors desiring to be placed on a roster or rosters must keep current records of any applicable licenses, certificates, registrations, bonding, insurance, or other appropriate matters on file with the city as a condition of being placed on a roster or rosters. The city reserves the right to exclude a contractor from the roster if they are deemed to be not responsible or to remove a contractor from the roster at such time as the city becomes aware of specific facts that would deem the contractor to be not responsible.
D. Publication of Small Works Roster. 
    1. At least once a year, the city shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction a notice of the existence of the roster or rosters and solicit the names of contractors for such roster or rosters. Responsible contractors shall be added to an appropriate roster or rosters at any time that they submit a written request and necessary records.
    2. The city will utilize the statewide electronic database developed and maintained by the Municipal Research and Services Center of Washington (MRSC Rosters) or successor agency.
E. Quotations for Small Works Roster Projects. The city shall obtain telephone, written or electronic quotations for public works contracts from contractors on the appropriate small works roster(s) to assure that a competitive price is established and to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, as defined in RCW 39.04.010 and 39.04.350, and ACC 3.12.050, as follows:
    1. A contract awarded from a small works roster need not be advertised. Invitations for quotations shall include an estimate of the scope and nature of the work to be performed as well as materials and equipment to be furnished. However, detailed plans and specifications need not be included in the invitation. This subsection does not eliminate other requirements for architectural or engineering approvals as to quality and compliance with building codes.
    2. Quotations may be invited from all appropriate contractors on the appropriate small works roster(s). As an alternative, quotations may be invited from at least five contractors on the appropriate small works roster(s) who have indicated the capability of performing the kind of work being contracted, in a manner that will equitably distribute the opportunity among the contractors on the appropriate roster.
    3. For the purpose of this section, “equitably distribute” means that the city may not favor certain contractors on the appropriate small works roster(s) over other contractors on the appropriate roster(s) who perform similar services. At the time bids are solicited, the city shall not inform a contractor of the terms or amount of any other contractor’s bid for the same project.
    4. A written record shall be made by the city of each contractor’s bid on the project and of any conditions imposed on the bid. Immediately after an award is made, the bid quotations obtained shall be recorded, open to public inspection, and available by telephone inquiry. (Ord. 6545 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5866 § 1, 2004; Ord. 4924 § 2, 1997; Ord. 4581 § 2, 1992. Formerly 3.12.030, 3.12.032 and 3.12.034.)

3.12.100 Limited public works process.
If a work, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement project is estimated to cost less than $35,000, or the current statutory limit in RCW 39.04.155(3), the city may award such a contract using the limited public works process provided under RCW 39.04.155(3).
Public works projects awarded under the limited public works process are exempt from the other requirements of the small works process provided under ACC 3.12.090.
For limited public works projects, the city shall solicit electronic or written quotations from a minimum of three contractors from the appropriate small works roster and shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder, as defined under RCW 39.04.010 and 39.04.350, and ACC 3.12.050. After an award is made, the quotations shall be open to public inspection and available by electronic request.
For limited public works projects, the city may waive the payment and performance bond requirements of Chapter 39.08 RCW and the retainage requirements of Chapter 60.28 RCW, thereby assuming the liability for the contractor’s nonpayment of laborers, mechanics, subcontractors, materialmen, suppliers, and taxes imposed under RCW Title 82 that may be due from the contractor for the limited public works project. However, the city shall have the right of recovery against the contractor for any payments made on the contractor’s behalf.
The city shall maintain a list of the contractors contacted and the contracts awarded during the previous 24 months under the limited public works process, including the name of the contractor, the contractor’s registration number, the amount of the contract, a brief description of the type of work performed, and the date the contract was awarded.

A. All owners of properties for which a payback agreement is in force and who have not previously paid their assessment will be assessed the charge as provided in the agreement at the time they receive benefit from the street or utility system improvements. A property benefits from a street improvement when it receives the beneficial use of the street as provided for in the payback agreement.

The applicant is required to provide changes of address or ownership every two years from the date of the signing of the agreement. If the applicant fails to provide the notification within 60 days of this date, the city may collect any reimbursement funds owed to the applicant under the contract and shall not reimburse those funds to the applicant. Any money collected by the city and not refunded to the applicant will be deposited in the city’s capital fund. (Ord. 6696 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 6512 § 1, 2014.)

Their frequency and extent, in aggregate, shall not have the effect of subverting the established fee schedule through a multiplicity of special rates or by inducing the public to anticipate and defer usage of a facility in order to take advantage of recurrent promotions.
    5. The opportunity to sponsor an arrangement shall be made available to individuals, associations, and businesses, similarly situated, on an equal basis, in accord with and subject to the department’s policies and procedures.
B. The circumstances when special promotions and marketing conditions are available shall be defined in the department’s policies and procedures. (Ord. 6547 § 1, 2014; Ord. 4406 § 2, 1990.)

3.68.030 Waiver of fees for individuals or groups.
A. The director may waive or reduce an entry, use or program fee for an organization, association, group of individuals, or an individual, and authorize the supervisor of a facility to do so, irrespective of any special promotion or event, whenever:
    1. Such a waiver vindicates a constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution through its Fourteenth Amendment or Article I, Section 3 of the Washington Constitution;
    2. The user provides services or assistance to the department in lieu of the fee that would otherwise apply, or provides in-kind services or leaves improvements to the facility that offset the reduced fee revenue;
    3. The user is poor or infirm or is a charitable organization assisting the poor or infirm, and charging the fee would have the effect of depriving the user or its clients of reasonable access to the facility or of opportunity to participate in a public event, and would cause hardship or directly reduce the assistance such organization provides to the poor or infirm;
    4. The user is an organization serving the public or the community, lacks its own facility as a result of a calamity or other temporary distress, and the temporary use of the city’s facility would allow the organization to continue providing service to the public or community. Such temporary use shall not exceed 90 days without further authorization from the city council;
    5. Another government requests use of the facility for a public purpose; or the use is granted under a reciprocal use of facilities agreement with another municipal government; or
    6. Free admission to the facility furthers a departmental purpose, e.g., the person is a volunteer for a department-sponsored or co-sponsored event, participates in an athletic event for public spectators, or enters in connection with a work assignment or to assist a concessionaire or as a parent or guardian to assist the department in the instruction or care of a minor or ward;
B. In determining whether a fee should be waived or reduced, the director shall be guided by the benefit to the public and the department when granting the request, the frequency and amount of usage requested, the effect on and fairness to other users, its consistency with policies underlying the fee schedule and this chapter, and the consequences of denying the request. (Ord. 6547 § 1, 2014; Ord. 4406 § 3, 1990.)

3.84.010 Defined.
A. “Telephone business” means the business of providing access to a local telephone network, local telephone network switching service, toll service, cellular telephone service, or coin telephone services, or providing telephonic, video, data, or similar communication or transmission for hire, via a local telephone network, toll line or channel, or similar communication or transmission system, and as more fully defined in RCW 82.04.065. It includes cooperative or farmer line telephone companies or associations operating an exchange. “Telephone business” does not include the providing of competitive telephone service, nor the providing of cable television service, nor the providing of broadcast services by radio or television stations.
B. “Cellular telephone service” is a two-way voice and data telephone/telecommunications system based in whole or substantially in part on wireless radio communications and which is not subject to regulation by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC). This includes cellular mobile service. The definition of cellular mobile service includes other wireless radio communications services such as specialized mobile radio (SMR), personal communications services (PCS), and any other evolving wireless radio communications technology which accomplishes a purpose similar to cellular mobile service. (Ord. 5673 § 2, 2002; Ord. 4722 § 1, 1994; Ord. 3679 § 4, 1981. Formerly 5.82.010.)

3.84.020 Competitive telephone service defined.
“Competitive telephone service” means the providing by any person of telecommunications equipment, apparatus, or service related to that equipment or apparatus, such as repair or maintenance services, if the equipment or apparatus is of a type which can be provided by persons that are not subject to regulation as telephone companies under RCW Title 80, and for which a separate charge is made. Transmission of communication through cellular telephones is classified as “telephone business” in ACC 3.84.010 rather than “competitive telephone service.” (Ord. 5673 § 2, 2002; Ord. 4722 § 2, 1994; Ord. 4594 § 2, 1992; Ord. 3679 § 4, 1981. Formerly 5.82.020.)

3.84.030 License – Required.
On and after January 1, 1982, no person, firm or corporation shall engage in or carry on any business, occupation, act or privilege for which a tax is imposed by ACC 3.84.040 without first having obtained, and being the holder of, a license so to do, to be known as an occupation license. Each such person, firm or corporation shall promptly apply to the Auburn business license clerk, as designated by the mayor, for such license upon such forms as the business license clerk shall prescribe, giving such information as the business license clerk shall deem reasonably necessary to enable the business license clerk’s office to administer and enforce this chapter, and, upon acceptance of such application by the business license clerk, the business license clerk shall thereupon issue such license to the applicant. Such occupation license shall be personal and nontransferable and shall be valid as long as the licensee shall continue in the business and shall comply with this chapter. (Ord. 5897 § 1, 2005; Ord. 5673 § 2, 2002; Ord. 3679 § 3, 1981. Formerly 5.82.030.)

3.84.040 Tax – Imposed.
On and after July 1, 2008, there is levied upon and there shall be collected from every person, firm or corporation engaged in carrying on the following business for hire or for sale of a commodity or a service within or partly within the corporate limits of the city, a tax for the privilege of so doing business as defined in ACC 3.84.010. Upon any telephone business there shall be levied a tax equal to six percent of the total gross operating revenues, including revenues from intrastate tolls derived from the operation of such business within the city. Gross operating revenues for this purpose shall not include charges which are passed on to the subscribers by a telephone company pursuant to tariffs required by regulatory order to compensate for the cost to the company of the tax imposed by this chapter. The increase in tax revenue generated by the additional one percent tax levied pursuant to Ordinance No. 6170 shall be relegated for use by the city in support of its arterial street system. It is provided, however, that if the state of Washington provides a long-term sustainable funding source to the city of Auburn arterial street fund in an amount sufficient to off-set the amount of the increases in utility tax rates of this chapter and the long-term funding source is sufficient to maintain the city of Auburn’s arterial street system’s pavement condition index (PCI) at an average of 70 PCI out of a score of 100 PCI for the foreseeable future, the telephone utility tax rate shall automatically revert to five percent of the total gross operating revenues on telephone businesses, including revenues from intrastate tolls derived from the operation of such business within the city. (Ord. 6170 § 3, 2008; Ord. 5797 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5673 § 2, 2002; Ord. 4185 § 2, 1986. Formerly 5.82.040.)

F. Charges by a taxpayer engaging in a telephone business to a telecommunications company, as defined in RCW 80.04.010, for telephone service that the purchaser buys for the purpose of resale. (Ord. 5673 § 2, 2002; Ord. 4722 § 3, 1994; Ord. 3679 § 6, 1981. Formerly 5.82.060.)

A. Service Address. Payments by a customer for the telephone service from telephones without a fixed location shall be allocated among taxing jurisdictions to the location of the customer’s principal service address during the period for which the tax applies.
B. Presumption. There is a presumption that the service address a customer supplies to the taxpayer is current and accurate, unless the taxpayer has actual knowledge to the contrary.
C. Roaming Phones. When the service is provided while a subscriber is roaming outside the subscriber’s normal cellular network area, the gross income shall be assigned consistent with the taxpayer’s accounting system to the location of the originating cell site of the call, or to the location of the main cellular switching office that switched the call.
D. Dispute Resolution. If there is a dispute between or among the city and another city or cities as to the service address of a customer who is receiving cellular telephone services and the dispute is not resolved by negotiation among the parties, then the dispute shall be resolved by the city and the other city or cities by submitting the issue for settlement to the Association of Washington Cities (AWC). Once taxes on the disputed revenues have been paid to one of the contesting cities, the cellular telephone service company shall have no further liability with respect to additional taxes, penalties, or interest on the disputed revenues so long as it promptly changes its billing records for future revenues to comport with the settlement facilitated by AWC. (Ord. 5673 § 2, 2002; Ord. 4722 § 4, 1994. Formerly 5.82.063.)

The program shall be administered as established in this chapter. (Ord. 6366 § 3, 2011.)

3.90.020 Emergency response caused by person’s intoxication – Recovery of costs from convicted person.
A. A person whose intoxication causes an incident resulting in an appropriate emergency response, and who, in connection with the incident, has been found guilty of or has had their prosecution deferred for (1) driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, RCW 46.61.502; (2) operating an aircraft under the influence of intoxicants or drugs, RCW 47.68.220; (3) use of a vessel while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, RCW 88.12.100; (4) vehicular homicide while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, RCW 46.61.520(1)(a); or (5) vehicular assault while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, RCW 46.61.522(1)(b), is liable for the expense of an emergency response by a public agency to the incident.
B. The expense of an emergency response is a charge against the person liable for expenses under this section. The charge constitutes a debt of that person and is collectible by the public agency incurring those costs in the same manner as in the case of an obligation under a contract, expressed or implied.
C. In no event shall a person’s liability under this section for the expense of an emergency response exceed $1,000 per incident. If more than one public agency makes a claim for payment from an individual for an emergency response to a single incident under the provisions of this section, and the sum of the claims exceeds the amount recovered, the division of the amount recovered shall be determined by an interlocal agreement consistent with the requirements of Chapter 39.34 RCW.

The total emergency response cost may be ordered by the court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city as restitution. Where the total emergency response cost has not been ordered by the court, the city may collect the expense of the emergency response in the same manner as a contract by sending notice to the person responsible via certified mail with a return receipt. Notice, sent to the last known address, shall be deemed delivered three days after mailing.
B. Any costs not paid within 60 days of the date ordered by the court or within 60 days of the date of issuance of the notice of liability may be referred to a collection agency. The cost of collection shall be added to the total amount owed by the person whose intoxication resulted in an emergency response.
C. The mayor or his designee shall have the authority to periodically review the use of these funds collected through the budget authorization process in order to ensure that the amounts collected will be primarily devoted to DUI enforcement emphases. (Ord. 6429 § 5, 2012; Ord. 6366 § 3, 2011.)

3.94.010 Findings of fact.
A. The city downtown core is an urban center as defined in Section 84.14.010 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) because it is an identifiable district where urban residents may obtain a variety of products and services.
B. The downtown core currently lacks sufficient available, desirable and convenient residential housing to meet the needs of the public who would be likely to live in the downtown core if desirable, attractive and livable places to live were available.
C. The provision of special property tax valuations within the downtown core will encourage construction of new multifamily housing, and that the provision of such additional housing opportunities in the downtown core will assist in achieving the goals of the city’s comprehensive plan, its downtown plan and the purposes set forth in RCW 84.14.007.
D. Encouraging the development of new residential units in the downtown core will enhance the use and redevelopment of existing developed areas, reducing sprawl, maximizing the public investment in the infrastructure of the community and ultimately increasing the valuation of property in the downtown. (Ord. 5779 § 1, 2003.)

3.94.020 Purpose.
As provided for in Chapter 84.14 RCW, the purpose of this chapter is to provide limited, eight-year exemptions from ad valorem property taxation for qualified new multifamily and rehabilitated multifamily housing constructed in the downtown core and 12-year exemptions from ad valorem property taxation for qualified new affordable multifamily and rehabilitated multifamily housing constructed in the downtown core in order to:
A. Accomplish the planning goals of the Growth Management Act, Chapter 36.70A RCW and the city of Auburn comprehensive and downtown plans;
B. Encourage residential opportunities, including affordable housing opportunities, within the downtown core;
C. Stimulate new construction of multifamily housing in the downtown core to increase housing opportunities;
D. Assist in directing future population growth into the city’s downtown core thereby encouraging the most efficient use of the city’s infrastructure;
E. Achieving development densities that enhance the use of the community’s mass transit opportunities and the public investment in such opportunities; and
F. Promote community development and downtown core revitalization in fulfillment of the city’s downtown plan. (Ord. 6257 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5779 § 1, 2003.)

    13. “Dangerous dog” means any dog that has been declared to be a dangerous dog pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or has been declared to be a dangerous dog pursuant to applicable code provisions by any other jurisdiction, by reason of the fact that the dog:
        a. Killed or inflicted severe injury on a human being without provocation on public or private property;
        b. Killed or inflicted severe injury on a domestic animal without provocation while the dog was off the owner’s property;
        c. Has been previously found to be potentially dangerous because of injury inflicted on a human, the owner having received notice of such, and the dog again aggressively bites, attacks, or endangers the safety of humans;
        d. Is a potentially dangerous dog, as defined in this chapter, that has been permitted or allowed to run free and unrestrained off the property of its owner;
        e. Is a potentially dangerous dog, as defined in this chapter, that has harassed, tormented or caused concern for the safety of persons or domestic animals; or

    It is provided, however, that a dog shall not be declared dangerous if the basis for such declaration was a threat, injury, or damage that was sustained by a person who, at the time, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner of the dog, or was tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog or has, in the past, been observed or reported to have tormented, abused, or assaulted the dog or was committing or attempting to commit a crime.

This proviso shall also not apply to instances where a dangerous dog declaration has been previously avoided because such training was given to the same owner for this or any other dog, or to any other person involving this same dog.
    It is further provided that for the purposes of subsection (A)(13)(d) of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a dog has been permitted or allowed to run free if the dog has been previously found running free and unrestrained off the property of its owner. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that, since the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, the dog has not previously been found running free and unrestrained off the property of its owner, and the owner has taken reasonable steps to prevent the dog from running free and unrestrained off the property of its owner.
    14. “Dog” means a member of the species Canis lupus familiaris and commonly known as the domestic dog.

    24. Police Dog. The definition of “police dog” in RCW 4.24.410, including all future amendments, additions, or deletions, is adopted by reference.
    25. “Potentially dangerous dog” means any dog that when unprovoked:
        a. Inflicts bites on a human or a domestic animal either on public or private property;
        b. Chases or approaches a person upon the streets, sidewalks, or any public grounds in a menacing fashion or apparent attitude of attack, or any dog with a known propensity, tendency, or disposition to attack unprovoked, or to cause injury or otherwise to threaten the safety of humans or domestic animals; or

The owner of the dangerous dog may appeal the animal control authority’s determination that the enclosure is not adequate or proper, which appeal shall be filed in writing not more than 10 days from the date the animal control authority communicates his/her determination that the enclosure is not adequate or proper, and which appeal shall be heard by the police chief or designee. The police chief or designee shall decide the appeal based on (a) whether the objective and identifiable reasons which were the basis of the animal control authority’s determination have been shown, and (b) whether they reasonably support the decision that the enclosure is not adequate or proper. It is provided, however, that regardless of the materials used, or type and description of the enclosure, and regardless of the correction of any identified deficiencies, if the dangerous dog escapes from the enclosure, that escape shall constitute prima facie evidence that the enclosure was not a proper enclosure, and shall constitute prima facie evidence, as well, that the dog owner is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
    28. “Securely enclosed and locked” means a pen or structure which has secure sides and a secure top suitable to prevent the entry of young children and designed to prevent the animal from escaping. If the pen or structure has no bottom secured to the sides, then the sides must be embedded in the ground no less than one foot below the surface of the ground.
    29. “Severe injury” means any physical injury that results in (a) broken bones, (b) muscle, ligament, or tendon tears, (c) skin lacerations or puncture wounds that require sutures or surgery, or (d) transmission of an infectious or contagious disease.

When a law enforcement or animal control officer has probable cause to believe a dog is a dangerous dog, he or she may impound the dog. Such dog shall be held in the shelter or a secure veterinary hospital until a hearing is held to determine the dog’s status or the deadline for requesting such a hearing has passed. When a law enforcement or animal control officer has probable cause to believe a dog is a potentially dangerous dog, he or she may impound the animal. The law enforcement or animal control officer may require that such dog be held in the shelter or a secure veterinary hospital until a hearing is held to determine the animal’s status or the deadline for requesting such a hearing has passed.

6.01.050 Notice of impounding animal.
Upon the impoundment of any animal under the provisions of this title, the animal control officer or shelter shall give written notice to the owner, if the owner is known, of the impounding of such animal and the terms upon which said animal can be redeemed. The notifying of any person over the age of 18 who resides at the owner’s domicile or mailing the notice to the address given to the city at the time the animal was licensed shall constitute actual notice to the owner. If the owner of said animal so impounded is unknown, and cannot be reasonably determined or located, no notice of impound shall be required, and the city and/or the animal shelter shall be entitled to take such action allowed under the city code as if notice were given. There shall be no obligation to determine the owner of such animal if the animal is not wearing a license or other identification or is not microchipped.

All fees and charges must be paid and the owner must sign an acknowledgment that he/she is aware of the obligations and responsibilities of animal owners pursuant to this title prior to redeeming the animal. A dog or cat may not be redeemed unless it is properly licensed.
B. If an impounded animal is not redeemed by the owner within 72 hours from time of impounding notice of impound pursuant to ACC 6.01.050, then the animal shall become the property of the animal shelter, and any person may adopt it by complying with the animal shelter’s adoption provisions. In the event that such animal is not redeemed or adopted within 120 hours after notice of impoundment, it may be humanely euthanized or otherwise disposed of within the discretion of the animal shelter.

In all cases, the veterinarian fees and costs shall be paid at the time of redemption by the animal’s owner or person redeeming the animal.
C. Exceptions to Mandatory Microchipping or Alteration. The alteration shall not be required upon a showing of proof of alteration from a licensed veterinarian.

The owner shall, at the same time, pay $100.00 as a nonrefundable appeal fee, and shall post a cash deposit of $250.00 to cover the additional costs incurred by the city and/or the animal shelter related to the impound, including but not limited to impound charges and costs of microchipping and alteration. It is further provided that, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, the owner shall be responsible for the costs of or related to the impound and any resulting microchipping and/or alteration. The decision of the police chief or designee on the appeal shall be final, unless the owner seeks injunctive relief from the King County superior court. (Ord. 6529 § 3, 2014; Ord. 6424 § 1, 2012.)

The alteration shall not be required if the owner or other person adopting the animal provides a written statement from a licensed veterinarian stating that the spay or neuter procedure would be harmful to the animal. (Ord. 6424 § 1, 2012.)

6.01.120 Conditions of release.
The animal control authority may refuse to release to its owner any animal that has been impounded more than once in a 12-month period unless the owner demonstrates that he or she has taken steps to reasonably ensure that the violation will not occur again. The shelter or the animal control authority may impose reasonable conditions that must be satisfied by the owner before release of the animal, including conditions assuring that the animal will be confined. Failure to comply with the conditions of release is a violation.
Any animal suffering from serious injury or disease may be humanely euthanized by the shelter or city; provided, that the shelter or city shall immediately notify the owner if the owner is known. The shelter and city have no obligation to determine the owner of such animal if the animal is not wearing a license or other identification or is not microchipped. (Ord. 6424 § 1, 2012.)

A. In addition to the enforcement authority with which the animal control authority has been vested pursuant to state law, the animal control authority shall be authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter; provided, that in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter to seek to declare a dog within the city to be dangerous, the animal control authority shall employ the notification and appeal procedures as defined in this section, including serving notice upon the dog owner in person or by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested.
B. The notice must state: the basis for the proposed action; the reasons the authority considers the animal dangerous; a statement that the dog is subject to registration and controls required by this chapter, including a recitation of the controls in subsections F and G of this section; and an explanation of the owner’s rights and of the proper procedure for appealing a decision finding the dog dangerous.
C. Prior to the authority issuing its final determination, the authority shall notify the owner in writing that he or she is entitled to an opportunity to meet with the authority, at which meeting the owner may give, orally or in writing, any reasons or information as to why the dog should not be declared dangerous, including the owner’s compliance with the AKC’s CGC program, or comparable course or program provisions as provided herein, if applicable. The owner may also request a reasonable delay before the final determination is made if the owner has already enrolled in the AKC’s CGC program, or comparable course or program, if applicable. The notice shall state the date, time, and location of the meeting, which must occur prior to expiration of 10 calendar days following delivery of the notice. The owner may propose an alternative meeting date and time, but such meeting must occur within the 10-day time period set forth in this section. After such meeting, the authority must issue its final determination, in the form of a written order, within 10 calendar days. In the event the authority declares a dog to be dangerous, the order shall include a recital of the authority for the action, a brief, concise statement of the facts that support the determination, and the signature of the person who made the determination. The order shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered in person to the owner at the owner’s last address known to the authority.
D. The owner may appeal the authority’s final determination that the dog is dangerous to the city’s hearing examiner, which appeal shall be in accordance with the provisions herein and pursuant to the procedures of the city code. Any such appeal by the owner shall be perfected by filing a written notice of such appeal with the city clerk within 15 days of the date the owner received the final determination if the order was delivered in person, or within 20 days of the date the order was mailed to the owner, by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk. While the appeal is pending, the authority may order that the dog be confined or controlled in compliance with ACC 6.35.030 and/or RCW 16.08.090. If the dog is determined to be dangerous, the owner must pay all costs of confinement and control.
E. It is unlawful for an owner to have a dangerous dog in the city without a certificate of registration issued pursuant to this section. This section and ACC 6.35.030 and 6.35.040 shall not apply to police dogs as defined in ACC 6.02.135 and/or RCW 4.24.410.
F. The animal control authority shall issue a certificate of registration to the owner of a dog deemed to be a dangerous dog if the owner presents to the animal control unit sufficient evidence of:

    3. A policy of liability insurance, such as homeowner’s insurance, issued by an insurer qualified under RCW Title 48 in the amount of at least $250,000, insuring the owner for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog, or such liability insurance that otherwise meets the requirements of RCW 16.08.080.
G. Any dog which is declared to be a “dangerous dog” pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 16.08 RCW shall also be required to be microchipped by a veterinarian of the owner’s choice, at the owner’s expense. This shall be in addition to the other requirements of this chapter and in addition to the applicable requirements for licensing as defined within this title, and this procedure must be accomplished within 30 days after the owner’s receipt of the dangerous dog declaration issued pursuant to this chapter or Chapter 16.08 RCW.
H. In addition to regular dog licensing fees, the owner of a dangerous dog shall pay to the city a dangerous dog registration fee in the amount of $500.00 per year for the dangerous dog registration, and shall comply with the city’s dangerous dog registration procedures, including providing the city with a photograph of the dangerous dog, each year.

B. It is unlawful for an owner of a potentially dangerous dog to permit the dog to be allowed or permitted to run free and unrestrained or off leash or not otherwise under physical restraint of a responsible person, unless within a fenced yard or similar restraint reasonably designed to prevent the dog from running free and unrestrained.

Compostables will not be accepted for pickup by a city-contracted service provider(s) if placed in plastic bags at curbside, or if the plastic bags containing compostables are placed in other approved containers for collection. Plastic bags are considered a contaminant and are noncompostable. Once the compostables cart is full, approved containers for compostables collection, including plastic or galvanized garbage containers no larger than 32 gallons in size and heavyweight brown paper bags, may be used for overflow volumes of compostables, excluding food scraps. Customer-owned containers used for the collection of overflow volumes of compostables shall be labeled with a durable sticker that clearly identifies the container’s contents as compostables.

B. Multi-unit residential accounts must have the same type of service for each “occupied unit” unless tenant and owner sign city tenant release form for single-family residence garbage service. Tenant then pays direct to the city for solid waste services and is provided variable solid waste service as defined in “single-family residence.” Owners are responsible for payment if tenant does not pay. If no payment is received from tenant or owner within 60 days of billing, service will revert back to multi-unit residential accounts. Residences can request a tenant release form only once in a year while they are at that address.
C. Property owners of property not specifically addressed elsewhere in this chapter are responsible for tenant payments. A tenant and owner may sign a city tenant release form for garbage service. Tenant then pays direct to city for solid waste services. Owners are responsible for payment if the tenant does not pay. If no payment is received from tenant or owner within 60 days of billing, service will revert back to a 35-gallon cart and tenant’s name will be removed from the account and the owner will be held responsible.
D. Garbage collections in excess of those included in the current monthly service (as listed on the account) shall be at the rate of $10.83 per each extra container of up to 32 gallons per pickup.

8.08.182 Nonlienable property class of utility customers.
A. There is hereby created a class of utility customers where the customers receiving solid waste utility services are receiving such services at property for which the city does not have the right to lien the property for nonpayment of utility services. The utility rates for such customers shall be as set forth in ACC 8.08.180; provided, that the city can also collect a utility services deposit as described as follows:
    1. The dollar amount of four months of the current solid waste rate for level of service requested; and
    2. The sum of the current rate for three late fees, per city code.
B. For the purposes hereof, “nonlienable property” means property which is owned or held by a governmental or nongovernmental entity in such a way that it is immune from utility lien collection efforts of the city.
C. This new class of utility customers shall include new customers – new applications for utility services on nonlienable property and existing and former customers of utility services on nonlienable property whose utility services have been terminated for nonpayment or whose accounts have been referred to collection or to other utility payment enforcement services or personnel for nonpayment of utility services. (Ord. 6439 § 2, 2012.)

8.08.183 Waiver of deposit for nonlienable property class of utility customers – Appeal.
A. In connection with the utility services deposit for the nonlienable property class of utility customers as described in ACC 8.08.182, the finance director is authorized to grant a full or partial waiver to said utility customer from the deposit requirement where special humanitarian or health circumstances exist with respect to said utility customer’s receipt of utility services. The finance director shall have the sole discretion to grant such waivers, and determine if they shall be full or partial waivers, where such circumstances are found by the finance director to exist. If the waiver is granted, no deposit or only a reduced deposit shall be required.
B. If any person or entity has applied for a waiver of the deposit requirement and has been denied the requested waiver, such person or entity may appeal the decision denying the requested waiver by filing with the city clerk a notice of appeal, which notice of appeal must be received by the city clerk within 30 days of the decision denying the requested waiver. The appeal shall be based solely on whether special humanitarian or health circumstances exist with respect to the utility customer’s receipt of utility services, and shall be heard by a panel of department directors of the city (excluding the finance director) appointed by the mayor. The decision of the panel of department directors shall be final, and no further appeals shall be allowed.
C. For the purposes hereof, the finance director and mayor shall utilize, as a guide in addressing requests for waivers, the criteria utilized in granting low income disabled citizen discounts and low income senior citizen discounts for utility customers of the city. (Ord. 6439 § 3, 2012.)

8.08.184 Regulations and requirements same for both classes of utility customers.
Other than the utility rates and deposits set forth in ACC 8.08.175 through 8.08.183, all other regulations and requirements in this chapter shall be the same for all classes of utility customers, unless the context of the provisions clearly indicates otherwise. (Ord. 6439 § 4, 2012.)

8.08.190 Special services.
A. Negotiated Charges.

Charges or accounts shall be paid at the finance director’s office 20 days after the billing date appearing on the bill. A delinquency charge of $15.00 or one percent of the outstanding balance, whichever is greater, will be assessed 30 days after the original bill date if payment is not received in the finance director’s office. Nonpayment of delinquent bills and associated charges over 45 days old shall result in:
    1. The suspension of all city utility services to the subject property regardless of whether such services are separately billed; and/or
    2. The removal of containers and reduction of service to the 35-gallon cart service, for which the customer shall continue to be charged and remain liable for payment.
B. While accounts may be opened and maintained by tenants, the owners of the property receiving the services shall be responsible for payment of all charges for the service. Commercial customers who are tenants will be denied delivery of containers until:
    1. A completed application is received and approved; and

Customers that have their service suspended/discontinued shall continue to be charged, and remain liable for, the monthly charge for 35-gallon cart garbage and recycling service, and shall be responsible for making arrangements for having their solid waste properly disposed of in a timely fashion.
B. The customer and owner shall be sent written notification by United States mail to the address of the subject property 20 days prior to service being suspended/discontinued. Service address may be notified by tagging of the container by the city. The notification shall state the determination to suspend/discontinue service to the subject property, and the specific reasons for the suspension/discontinuance. The customer may, within 15 days of mailing of said notification, request in writing an evaluation on the determination of suspension/discontinuance. The evaluation request shall be mailed or delivered to the city to the attention of the finance director. An evaluation shall be set to include the finance director and is to be held within 10 business days of receipt by the city of the evaluation request. The decision of the finance director shall be final.

8.12.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to define what constitutes a public nuisance and how a public nuisance will be abated. The intended result of abating a public nuisance is to protect public health and property values by reducing visual blight, reducing the opportunity for harboring of rodents and pests, providing for safer pedestrian and automobile traffic flow, and reducing impacts to the environment by preventing the indiscriminate storage of inoperable vehicles. Public nuisances will be abated in all areas of the city with emphasis in the residential neighborhoods. (Ord. 5747 § 1, 2003; Ord. 2967 § 1, 1976; 1957 code § 7.04.270.)

8.12.020 Nuisances affecting public health and safety.
Acts or omissions, places, conditions and things or uses that injure or endanger the safety, health, welfare, comfort or general well-being of the general public or the environment are declared to be public nuisances. Public nuisances include, but are not limited to, the following:
A. The erecting, maintaining, using, placing, depositing, causing, allowing, leaving, or permitting to be or remain in or upon any private lot, building, structure, or premises, or in or upon any street, avenue, alley, park, parkway, or other public or private place in the city, any one or more of the following places, conditions, things or acts to the prejudice, danger, or annoyance of others or that interfere with safe travel;

E. Trash, litter, rags, debris, accumulations of empty barrels, boxes, crates, packing cases, mattresses, bedding, excelsior, packing hay, straw, or other packing material, lumber not neatly piled, or other material, which provides harborage for insects, rodents, or other pests;
F. Any unsightly and dangerous building, billboard or structure, as determined by the city building official;
G. All places used or maintained as junkyards or dumping grounds, or for the wrecking, disassembling, repair or rebuilding of automobiles, trucks, tractors or machinery of any kind, or for the storing or leaving of worn-out wrecked or abandoned automobiles, trucks, tractors or machinery of any kind or of any of the parts thereof, or for the storing or leaving of any machinery or equipment used by contractors or builders or by other persons, which places are kept or maintained so as to provide harborage for insects, rodents or other pests, excluding properly zoned and licensed wrecking yards, junkyards or machinery being used;
H. Garbage disposed of in any manner other than provided in the solid waste code (Chapter 8.08 ACC);
I. Garbage cans which are not impervious to rodent gnawing or do not have tight-fitting lids;

K. Blackberry vines or any tall grass or weeds which are infested with insects, rodents or other pests;
L. Grass clippings, cut brush or cut weeds which may create an insect or rodent harborage;
M. Nests, colonies, hives or apiaries of bees, Africanized honey bees, yellow jackets, hornets or wasps which are not in full compliance with Chapter 15.60 RCW or Chapter 16-602 WAC, or which are not in full compliance with the city’s zoning and land use codes or with the city’s business licensing and registration codes;
N. Any accumulation of combustible, explosive or flammable substances which are stored in a way that poses a threat or danger to life or property;
O. Ditches, holes, pits, accumulations of debris, dirt or construction materials or other materials, or breaks in impervious surface in any public right-of-way, or any other condition that obstructs or interferes with safe pedestrian or vehicular travel on or along said right-of-way; and
P. Failure, after reasonable notice, to restore a city street, sidewalk or related infrastructure facility to city standards after having destroyed, disrupted or adversely impacted such street, sidewalk or related infrastructure facility from its use for safe public travel;
Q. It is also a public nuisance to store, keep or allow junk to accumulate unless within a building or outdoor storage yard; provided further, that the building and/or outdoor storage yard must otherwise meet all other applicable requirements of the city including allowing for the storage of junk.

The term “junk” does not include recyclable items that are associated with a permitted recycling industry; provided, that the indiscriminate storage of recyclables in areas not otherwise allowed for storage will be considered junk and a public nuisance;
R. Any and all other violations of the provisions of this title and ACC Titles 1, 5, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20. (Ord. 6615 § 9, 2016; Ord. 5837 § 5, 2004; Ord. 5747 § 1, 2003; Ord. 2904 § 1, 1976; 1957 code § 7.04.280.)

8.12.060 Structures and buildings as nuisances.
A. It is a public nuisance to have a fence or similar structure with any barbed wire, razor wire or similar wire located within five feet of any public sidewalk unless the barbed wire, razor wire or similar wire is located at a height greater than eight feet above the ground. It is provided, however, that any fence legally constructed and installed before April 12, 2003, shall be exempt from the provisions hereof, so long as any barbed wire, razor wire or similar wire on or affixed to the fence is located at a height of not less than six feet, and so long as no barbed wire, razor wire or similar wire on the fence projects beyond or intrudes past the boundary of the property on which the fence or similar structure is located.
B. It is a public nuisance for any vacant, unused, or unoccupied building or structure within the city to have any broken, missing, or open doors, windows, or other openings, allows access by unauthorized persons or the general public.
C. A building or structure, whether occupied or not, will also be considered a public nuisance if it has exterior elements that are defective, decayed or will in any way contribute to the significant degradation of the building, and; if those exterior elements are not repaired or otherwise abated, the building, within a relatively short period of time, will become unsafe or make the building or structure uninhabitable. (Ord. 6461 § 1, 2013; Ord. 5747 § 1, 2003; 1957 code § 7.04.320.)

8.12.070 Maintaining or permitting nuisance.
Every person who commits or maintains a public nuisance, for which no special punishment is prescribed, or who willfully omits or refuses to perform any legal duty relating to the removal of such nuisance, and every person who lets or permits to be used any building or boat or portion thereof, knowing that it is intended to be or is being used for committing or maintaining any such nuisance, is guilty of a violation of this code and is punishable in accordance with ACC 1.25.050. (Ord. 6615 § 10, 2016; Ord. 6461 § 1, 2013; Ord. 5747 § 1, 2003; 1957 code § 7.04.340.)

8.12.080 Abatement by city – Costs liability.
A. Abatement. Notwithstanding the existence or use of any other remedy, the city may order the abatement of any nuisance detrimental to the health and welfare of the public, or source of filth.
    1. Prior to any order, written notice for the repair, demolition, remedy, removal, or abatement shall be signed by the director of community development and public works, or designee, and served upon the person owning, occupying, or controlling such premises.
    2. If the nuisance has not been repaired, demolished, remedied, removed, or otherwise abated, or if the notice has not been appealed pursuant to subsection C of this section within 10 calendar days after service thereof, then the director of community development and public works, or his or her designee, may issue an order authorizing the city to effect the abatement.
B. Service. The director shall cause any notice or order of abatement to be served on the property owner(s) and/or tenant(s), all parties that have an interest in the property, and to any person(s) causing or allowing or participating in the violation. The notice or order of abatement to the owner(s) shall be served by personal service or by mailing a copy by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, sent to his/her last known address, and to any other such person(s) by sending via regular mail, postage prepaid, to his/her last known address. A notice or order of abatement shall also be provided by posting a copy thereof conspicuously on the property.
C. Appeal. 
    1. Notices of abatement may be appealed to the hearing examiner within 10 calendar days of the date of mailing or service. The appeal may contest the determination that a violation exists, the reasonableness of the corrective action ordered, or both. An appeal shall be filed by providing a written request to the city clerk. The application shall contain the following:
        a. The address that is the subject of the violation.
        b. The person’s name, phone number, and address.
        c. A brief description of the legal interest the person has in the real or personal property to be abated.
        d. The reason(s) supporting reversal, modification, or limitation of the proposed abatement, together with any material facts that support those reason(s).
        e. A description of the relief sought.
        f. Signatures of the person(s) submitting the application.
    2. A fee is not required to be paid to file an appeal, unless the examiner denies the appellant any relief regarding the abatement, in which case the fee is that fee set forth in the city of Auburn fee schedule.
    3. If an appeal is properly and timely filed, the examiner shall set a date, time, and place for the hearing of the appeal. Such date shall be within 30 calendar days of the date the city received the request for an appeal. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given at least seven calendar days prior to the date of the hearing to each appellant by either causing a copy of such notice to be delivered to the appellant personally or by mailing a copy, postage prepaid, to the address shown on the appeal.
    4. The effect of failure to appeal, the scope of the hearing, the hearing procedures, the conduct of the hearing, the right to review of the appeal, limitations of the examiner’s authority, and the form and effective date of the examiner’s decision shall all be governed by the provisions in ACC 15.07.130, as hereafter amended. The property owner shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has not occurred at the subject property and/or that the corrective action is unreasonable.
    5. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay the abatement during the pendency of the appeal, but an appeal does not lift or stay a stop work order. Monetary penalties shall accrue during the appeal period unless the appellant prevails on appeal. In addition to ruling upon the issues presented by the appellant, the examiner may vacate or reduce any penalties pending, or previously imposed, for any violations related to the nuisance that is the subject of the abatement. If previously imposed penalties are vacated or reduced, any liens for those amounts shall be released or modified accordingly as well.
    6. If the examiner denies the appellant’s request for relief, the appellant shall pay the hearing fee as set forth in the city of Auburn fee schedule within 14 calendar days of the hearing. Failure to pay the fee shall be a cost of the abatement subject to cost recovery under this section.
D. Cost Recovery. The person on whom an order of abatement was served, in addition to incurring any penalty provided, shall become indebted to the city for the damages and legal and administrative costs and charges incurred by the city in the repair, demolition, remedy, removal, or abatement of such nuisance.
    1. The city shall bill its costs to the person(s) obligated to perform the work under the notice of failure to correct a violation, an order to stop work or an order of a court, which costs shall become due and payable 30 calendar days after the date of the bill.
    2. If the costs remain unpaid after 30 calendar days, the mayor may levy a special assessment on the property on which the nuisance was abated, including interest at such rates as provided in RCW 84.56.020, as now or hereafter amended, and contract with the county treasurer to collect the assessment pursuant to RCW 84.56.035. The finance director shall certify to the county treasurer the city’s costs, charges, and damages. The validity of any assessment made under the provisions of this chapter shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the same is commenced within 15 calendar days after the assessment is placed upon the assessment roll.
        a. The special assessment shall be in the amount of the city’s costs, charges and damages in abating the nuisance, including administrative and legal costs, the amount of relocation assistance advanced under RCW 59.18.085, the costs of enforcing the assessment, and the amount of all outstanding penalties. In any such assessment by the city, the city shall also be entitled to interest accruing at the rate of 12 percent per annum beginning 30 days after the date of the bill described in subsection (D)(1) of this section.
    3. Additionally, if the amount described in subsection (D)(1) of this section is unpaid after 30 calendar days, the mayor, or his or her designee, is authorized to file a lien against the property where the nuisance was abated, or on the adjacent property where the nuisance was located on public property or on public right-of-way and where the nuisance was caused by or on behalf of the owner of the adjacent property.
        a. The lien shall be in the amount of the city’s damages and costs in abating the nuisance, including administrative and legal costs, the amount of relocation assistance advanced under RCW 59.18.085, the costs of enforcing the lien, and the amount of all outstanding penalties. In any such assessment by the city, the city shall also be entitled to interest accruing at the rate of 12 percent per annum beginning 30 days after the date of the bill described in subsection (D)(1) of this section.
        b. The lien shall be of equal rank with state, county and municipal taxes and shall be in similar form, be filed with the same county office, filed in the same manner, be enforced and foreclosed in the same way, and subject to the same exemptions as state law provides for the foreclosure of labor and material liens.
    4. Additionally, the city may, in conformity with Chapter 3.30 ACC, refer to a collection agency the abatement costs described in subsection (D)(1) of this section, which shall include the collection agency fee and any penalty assessed pursuant to Chapter 1.25 ACC.
    5. The provisions of this chapter relative to the recovery of abatement costs are not exclusive, and all other rights or remedies of the city, or any citizen thereof, relative to recovering abatement costs are to remain in full force and effect.
    6. For purposes of this section “administrative costs” shall include, but are not limited to, recording and filing fees, personnel costs incurred in the inspection of the property, preparation of notices, contracts, and other documents necessary for performing the abatement and providing law enforcement during the abatement.
    7. In this section, “legal costs” shall include, but not be limited to, attorney fees, expert witness fees, recording and filing fees, and personnel costs incurred in preparing contracts, and notices necessary for performing the abatement.
E. Salvage. Any salvage value proceeds resulting from the abatement of the property shall first be applied to the costs of abatement. Any remaining such monies shall be paid to the property owner as shown on the last equalized assessment roll.
F. Obstruction with Work Prohibited. No person shall obstruct, impede or interfere with the city, its employees or agents, or any person who owns or holds any interest or estate in any property in the performance of any necessary act, preliminary or incidental to carrying out the requirements of this section. A violation of this provision shall constitute a misdemeanor, and shall be punishable as provided by ACC 1.24.010. (Ord. 6647 § 3, 2017; Ord. 6615 § 11, 2016; Ord. 6328 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5837 § 6, 2004; Ord. 5747 § 1, 2003; 1957 code § 7.04.330.)

8.12.090 Abatement order.
The magistrate before whom there may be pending any proceeding for a violation of maintaining or permitting a nuisance, except as defined hereinabove, shall, in addition to any fine or other punishment which it may impose for such violation, order the defendant to abate such nuisance and all property unlawfully used in the maintenance thereof destroyed at the cost of the defendant. (Ord. 6615 § 12, 2016; Ord. 5747 § 1, 2003; 1957 code § 7.04.350.)

8.12.100 Summary abatement.
A. Abatement. Whenever any violation of this code poses an imminent threat to the health, safety, or welfare of persons or property, or to the environment, the director of the department of community development and public works, or designee, may summarily and without prior notice order the condition abated. The city, or its agents, may enter upon property and abate the condition to the extent necessary to remedy the immediate threat.
Actions taken to abate imminently dangerous violations may include but are not limited to repair, removal or demolition of the condition creating the danger and/or the restriction from use or occupancy of the property on which the dangerous condition exists or any other abatement action determined by the city to be necessary.
B. Notice. Whenever the director determines that summary abatement is justified the city shall attempt to provide notice to the property owner as to the violation and the need for immediate abatement. If the property owner cannot be located or the owner fails to take prompt appropriate action to abate the violation, the city may proceed to take abatement action authorized in this chapter without further notice or right to a prior hearing.
Regardless of any prior notice, the city shall provide written notice of such abatement to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. If the person responsible for the violation is a tenant, notice of such abatement shall also be given to the landlord or owner of the property where the violation is occurring. In addition to the items listed in ACC 1.25.030(C)(1) through (4), the notice shall include the reason for the summary abatement, a description of the abatement, and the right to appeal the city’s action in the manner described for an appeal in ACC 8.12.080. The notice shall be served according to the service requirements of ACC 8.12.080.
C. Appeal. The abatement may be appealed in the manner described in ACC 8.12.080. No right of action shall lie against the city or its agents, officers, or employees for actions reasonably taken to prevent or cure any such immediate threats, or the failure to take such actions.
D. Cost Recovery. The necessary and reasonable charges and costs of summary abatement, including legal and administrative costs and charges, shall be collected according to ACC 8.12.080, unless the property owner, tenant, or person responsible for the violation prevails in an appeal. (Ord. 6615 § 2, 2016.)

8.13.010 Graffiti deemed nuisance.
A. Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance.
B. Although it is appropriate, where possible, to request that the courts require people who are convicted of acts of defacement and vandalism involving application of graffiti to public or private property to restore the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, obtaining convictions for such acts is difficult because the offenses involving such offenses can be committed so very quickly and secretively that witnesses to the acts are frequently nonexistent.
C. Although the public should be encouraged to cooperate in the elimination of graffiti by reporting the same to the proper authorities, it is also important to eliminate the presence of graffiti from the community so that the product of the illegal acts of those involved in application of graffiti is not visible and the property on which the graffiti is located and surrounding properties do not suffer diminution of value. (Ord. 5650 § 1, 2002.)

8.13.020 Definitions.
For the purposes of this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:
A. “Graffiti” means the defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances on public or private buildings, structures and places, including natural features of the environment.
B. “Graffiti abatement procedure” means the abatement procedure which identifies graffiti, issues notice to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures in absence of response.
C. “Private contractor” means any person with whom the city shall have duly contracted to remove graffiti. (Ord. 5650 § 1, 2002.)

A. Public Nuisance. Abandoned shopping carts constitute a public nuisance, create potential hazards to the health and safety of the public, and interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the city. The accumulation of wrecked and dismantled abandoned shopping carts on public property tends to create conditions that reduce property values, and promotes blight and deterioration.
B. Intention. The intent of this chapter is to ensure that measures are taken to facilitate the retrieval of abandoned shopping carts in a manner consistent with state law.
C. Applicability. This chapter shall apply to all owners of any business establishments or other commercial services within the city of Auburn that provide shopping carts for customer use or the public. (Ord. 6530 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5906 § 1, 2005.)

        a. Identity of owner, business establishment, or both.
        b. Notification to the public that the removal of the shopping cart from the premises is a violation of state law, and notification to the public of the procedure to be utilized for authorized removal of the cart from the premises.
        c. The address or phone number of the owner of the business establishment for shopping cart return.
    2. Any shopping cart found abandoned on public property that does not have the identification and information required by subsection B of this section, or does not have other ownership information or identification that is sufficient, in the city’s determination, to allow the city to mail to the owner an invoice/notice of impoundment by certified mail, return receipt requested, may be removed from such public property and disposed of by the city in accordance with state law for disposition of abandoned property. The determination of whether there is sufficient information of ownership, where the identification requirements of subsection B of this section are not met, shall be in the sole discretion of the director. (Ord. 6530 § 1, 2014; Ord. 6046 § 1, 2006; Ord. 5906 § 1, 2005.)

8.18.040 Nuisance – Enforcement.
Abandoned shopping carts are declared to be a public nuisance. The city’s enforcement rights for abandoned shopping carts are nonexclusive, and include the enforcement methods provided in this chapter and in this title of the city code, as well as any other methods for abatement of nuisances, and any other enforcement methods available under the law or in equity, including the following:
A. Civil Enforcement. Any owner who violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject to enforcement procedures for each violation in accordance with Chapter 1.25 ACC.
B. Impoundment, Retrieval and Notification. 
    1. As an alternative to civil enforcement or other methods of enforcement, the director may impound any abandoned shopping carts left on any public property owned by or under the control of the city, or left on any public right-of-way within the city. The director may hold impounded shopping carts at the city’s maintenance and operations yard until retrieved by the owner or disposed of by the city as herein provided.
    2. Whenever the director has impounded any abandoned shopping carts bearing the identification of ownership as required by ACC 8.18.030(B), or such other ownership information or identification that is sufficient, in the city’s determination, to allow the city to mail to the owner an invoice/notice of impoundment by certified mail, return receipt requested, the director or designee shall mail an invoice/notice of impoundment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner at the address shown on the shopping cart’s identification label, or such address as is determined by the director to be appropriate to give reasonable notice to the owner where the identification requirements of ACC 8.18.030(B) are not met. Such invoice/notice shall advise that the impounded shopping carts may be redeemed at the city’s maintenance and operations yard during the normal work day (between 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays) upon payment of the administrative impoundment fee of $30.00 per shopping cart. The invoice/notice shall also advise the owner that if the impounded abandoned shopping carts are not retrieved within 14 days of the date of the invoice/notice, the abandoned shopping carts shall be subject to disposal by the city, and in addition to the $30.00 administrative impoundment fee the owner shall also be obligated to pay an additional $70.00 disposal fee, per shopping cart.
    3. If the impounded abandoned shopping carts are not retrieved within 14 days of the date of the invoice/notice, the director shall be authorized to dispose of the abandoned shopping carts through whatever means or manner the director deems reasonable and appropriate. In the event of such disposal, the director is authorized to take appropriate steps to collect the $30.00 administrative impoundment fee, as well as the additional $70.00 disposal fee, per shopping cart. The shopping cart disposal fee shall be in addition to the administrative impoundment fee, and the administrative impoundment fee shall be due and owing regardless of whether or not the shopping carts are retrieved.
    4. If an abandoned shopping cart is impounded that does not have the ownership identification information permanently affixed to it as required by ACC 8.18.030(B), or does not have other ownership information or identification that is sufficient, in the city’s determination, to allow the city to mail to the owner an invoice/notice of impoundment by certified mail, return receipt requested, the director shall be authorized to dispose of it immediately, without any notice requirements.

At least 10 calendar days prior to abating the nuisance, the code enforcement official shall notify the property owner of the intended abatement. The notice shall be sent in the same manner and to the same individuals as provided in ACC 8.20.030. The notice shall include a statement that the property owner shall be responsible for the costs of the abatement, which shall be a lien upon the property if unpaid, that the property owner may appeal the abatement determination pursuant to ACC 8.20.060, and the procedures for making such appeal.

If the property owner fails to pay such bill, or if the owner cannot be found, the officer may cause a special assessment to be levied, in the manner provided in ACC 8.12.080, and/or a lien to be filed against the property. The lien shall be in similar form, be filed with the same county office, filed within the same time and manner, and be enforced and foreclosed in the same way as state law provides for the foreclosure of labor and material liens. Additionally, the city may refer to a collection agency the abatement costs, which shall include the collection agency fee, and any penalty assessed pursuant to Chapter 1.25 ACC shall include the abatement costs.

An appeal shall be filed by providing a written request to and shall contain the address that is the subject of the violation, the property owner’s name, phone number, and address, and a description of the reason(s) for contesting the abatement.
B. Notice of Meeting. If an appeal is properly and timely filed, the director shall set a meeting for a date within 30 calendar days of the date the city received the request for an appeal.

Any written document may be provided to the director prior to the meeting date. The director may reasonably limit the extent of comments at the meeting to facilitate the orderly and timely conduct of the meeting. A code enforcement officer shall be present at the meeting to answer questions and the director shall electronically record the meeting. The property owner shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has not occurred at the subject property and/or that the corrective action is unreasonable.
D. Ruling. In response to an appeal, the mayor may rescind the abatement notice, affirm it, or may modify the notice. Additionally, the mayor may vacate or reduce any penalties pending, or previously imposed, for any violations related to the nuisance that is the subject of the abatement. If previously imposed penalties are vacated or reduced, any liens for those amounts shall be released or modified accordingly as well.
E. Continuances – Communication of the Ruling. The director may continue the meeting if he or she is unable to hear all the statements, or for other good cause. If the meeting is continued, announcement of the new time, date and location of the next meeting is sufficient and no further notice of the meeting need be given by the city.
After the appeal meeting, the director will issue its final determination, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the meeting. The determination shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or served, to the property owner’s last known address.
F. Stay. The timely filing of an appeal shall stay the abatement during the pendency of the appeal, but an appeal does not lift or stay a stop work order. Monetary penalties shall accrue during the appeal period unless the appellant prevails on appeal. In addition to ruling upon the issues presented by the appellant, the director may vacate or reduce any penalties pending, or previously imposed, for any violations related to the vegetation nuisance that is the subject of the abatement. If previously imposed penalties are vacated or reduced, any liens for those amounts shall be released or modified accordingly.
If the examiner denies the appellant’s request for relief, the appellant shall pay the hearing fee as set forth in the city of Auburn fee schedule within 14 calendar days of the hearing. Failure to pay the fee shall be a cost of the abatement subject to cost recovery under this section. (Ord. 6615 § 3, 2016.)

It is the specific intent of this chapter to place the obligation of complying with its requirements upon the property owner or owners and no provisions nor term used in this chapter is intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers and employees, for whom the implementation or enforcement of this chapter shall be discretionary and not mandatory.

9.02.010 Purposes – Principles of construction.
A. The general purposes of the provisions governing the definition of offenses are:
    1. To forbid and prevent conduct that inflicts or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests;
    2. To safeguard conduct that is without culpability from condemnation as criminal;
    3. To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense;
    4. To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses, and to prescribe proportionate penalties for each.
B. The provisions of this title shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms and when the language is susceptible to differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this title. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

9.02.020 City criminal jurisdiction.
Any person who commits within the corporate limits of the city any crime that is a violation hereof, in whole or in part, or a violation the prosecution of which is the responsibility of the city pursuant to RCW 39.34.180, is liable to arrest and punishment. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

9.02.030 Classes of crimes – Penalties.
A. An offense defined by this code, for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized, constitutes a “violation of city ordinance” and a “crime.” For purposes of this code, the two terms shall have the same meaning and may be used interchangeably.
B. Violations of city ordinances are classified as gross misdemeanors or misdemeanors. A violation of a city ordinance is a misdemeanor if not otherwise designated by this code or by the code adopted by reference, and persons convicted thereof may be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not in excess of 90 days.

C. Unless otherwise specifically provided, misdemeanors shall be punishable by imprisonment in jail for a term of up to 90 days, or by a fine of up to $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine. Unless otherwise specifically provided, gross misdemeanors shall be punishable by imprisonment in jail for a term of up to one year, or by a fine of up to $5,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine.

9.02.050 Limitation of action.
A. No violation of city ordinance which is classified as a gross misdemeanor herein or in the code adopted by reference may be prosecuted more than two years after its commission. No violation of city ordinance classified as a misdemeanor herein or in the code adopted by reference may be prosecuted more than one year after its commission.
B. The periods of limitation prescribed herein do not run during any time when the person charged is not usually and publicly resident within this state.
C. If, before the end of a period of limitation prescribed herein, a complaint or an information has been filed, and the complaint or information is set aside, then the period of limitation is extended by a period equal to the length of time from the filing to the setting aside. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

9.02.060 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
A. Every person charged with a violation of a city ordinance that constitutes a crime is presumed innocent unless proved guilty. No person may be convicted of such a violation unless each element of such crime is proved by competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
B. When a violation of such a city ordinance has been proven against a person, and there exists a reasonable doubt as to which of two or more degrees he or she is guilty, such person shall be convicted only of the lowest degree. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

9.02.070 Non-appearance after written promise.
Any person who, after having been issued a citation for a criminal traffic or criminal nontraffic violation by a law enforcement officer or by any other person authorized to issue criminal citations or complaints under law and where the person so charged signed a written promise to appear in court at a specific date and time or as otherwise indicated on the citation or complaint, fails to appear in court at the date and time so indicated shall be guilty of a misdemeanor regardless of the disposition of the charge with which he or she was originally cited. Violation of this section shall be punishable by imprisonment in jail for a period of up to 90 days or a fine in the amount up to $1,000 or both such jail and fine. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

9.02.080 Intentional failure to comply.
A court may, in its discretion, treat any intentional failure to comply with a court order in respect to fines or costs, or both, upon conviction, as civil contempt. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

9.02.090 Conviction – Judgment for fine and costs.
Upon judgment for fine and costs rendered on a conviction, execution may be issued against the property of a defendant and returned in the same manner as in civil actions. (Ord. 5682 § 1, 2002.)

A. Statutes of the state of Washington specified herein and as specified in ordinances codified in this title are adopted by reference as and for a portion of the penal code of the city of Auburn, as if set forth in full, including the criminal/offense classification and penalty provisions applicable thereto unless a different classification and/or penalty is specifically provided for the particular sections of state statutes adopted by reference; provided, that the adoption of state statutes by reference shall not be construed or interpreted to vest in the city any authority or responsibility to prosecute felony offenses, and the adoption of state statutes which include felony provisions shall be limited to those provisions falling within the city’s authority, and such adoption, and the provisions being adopted, shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the lawful authority of the city.

B. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such intent is manifested are the following:
    1. Such person is a known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller. For purposes of this chapter, a “known unlawful drug user, possessor, or seller” is a person who has been convicted in any court within this state of any violation involving the use, possession, or sale of any of the substances referred to in Chapters 69.41, 69.50, 69.52 and 69.53 RCW, or substantially similar laws of any political subdivision of this state or of any other state; or who is known to have been arrested for a drug-related violation not resulting in a conviction because the person participated in a diversionary program, deferral program, drug court or a similar program; or a person who displays physical characteristics of drug intoxication or usage, such as “needle tracks”; or who possesses marijuana in a manner not authorized by RCW 69.50.4013(1), 69.50.4013(2) and/or in amounts that exceed those set forth in 69.50.360(3);
    2. Such person is currently subject to an order from any court prohibiting his/her presence in a high drug activity geographic area;

    4. Such person is physically identified by a police officer, based on articulable factors, as a member of a “gang,” or an association which engages in illegal drug activity. Factors that support an officer physically identifying a person as a member of such a gang or association include, but are not limited to, clothing, tattoos, known association and/or affiliation with such gang or association, specific and observed acts or circumstances consistent with drug-related activity, and gestures, signs, greetings and movements that are consistent with gang-related activity; provided, that clothing alone shall not be sufficient, without more, to support an officer physically identifying a person as a member of such a gang or association;
    5. Such person transfers small objects or packages for currency in a furtive fashion;
    6. Such person takes flight upon the appearance of a police officer;
    7. Such person manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object which reasonably could be involved in an unlawful drug-related activity;

9.24.020 Designation of anti-drug emphasis areas.
A. Certain areas of the city shall be designated as and identified to be anti-drug emphasis areas based on the repeat incidents of illegal drug activities occurring therein, enforcement of which shall be enhanced through the use of court orders prohibiting offenders convicted of unlawful drug-related acts or loitering for drug purposes within the said areas from entering or remaining in anti-drug emphasis areas. The areas to be so designated shall be identified by the city council in an ordinance or resolution passed after consultation with the mayor, city attorney and the chief law enforcement officer of the city, and the list identifying such areas shall be kept on file in the office of the city clerk. Additional areas may also be identified by the judge of the municipal or district court hearing drug-related cases arising from within the city. If a defendant is convicted of a drug-related case occurring within an area designated as an anti-drug emphasis area, a condition or term of sentence, deferral, or suspension shall be that such defendant shall stay out of all areas of the city designated as an anti-drug emphasis area, unless the court finds extenuating circumstances in the defendant’s particular case justifying avoidance of some or any of the requirement for such condition or term of sentence, deferral, or suspension. In such case, the extenuating circumstances shall be identified and recited in the record of the case, and any variation in conditions or terms of sentence deferral, suspended sentence or reduction or exclusion of anti-drug emphasis areas shall also be identified and recited in the record of the case. The court ordered condition or term of sentence, deferral, or suspension shall be in effect for the period of two years from the date of the court’s order; provided, that the defendant may petition the court for modification or earlier termination of the order.

F. If a false robbery, holdup or panic alarm has occurred and the alarm was triggered using a single action, nonrecessed device, the alarm administrator may consider a waiver or partial waiver of the false alarm fee, if action is taken by the alarm user to remove or replace the single action, nonrecessed device.
G. The alarm administrator will make a copy of the ordinance codified in this section and/or an ordinance summary sheet available to each alarm user. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

D. Any monitoring company requesting an alarm dispatch request for a nonpermitted alarm system shall pay an administration fee of $100.00 per incident. If the fee is not paid within 30 days after the invoice is mailed, a late fee in the amount of $25.00 is hereby imposed on the monitoring company.
E. If cancellation of police response occurs prior to the police officer’s arrival at the alarm site, the response is not considered a false alarm and no fee will be assessed.
F. The alarm installation company shall be assessed a fee of $100.00 if the officer responding to the false alarm determines that an employee of the alarm installation company directly caused the false alarm. Such false alarms are not included in the total number of false alarms for the alarm user.
G. A fee of $100.00 is hereby imposed against any monitoring company that fails to verify alarm system signals as required in ACC 9.30.080(J)(3).
H. A fee in the amount of $200.00 is hereby imposed against an alarm installation company if the alarm administrator determines that an employee of the alarm installation company knowingly or recklessly made a false statement concerning the inspection of an alarm site or the performance of an alarm system.
I. Notice of the right of appeal under this chapter will be included with notice of any fee.
J. All registration fees, renewal registration fees, service fees or fines assessed under this section are due within 30 days of written notice unless otherwise noted. A late fee of $25.00 shall be assessed for each individual registration fee due and all other fees due that are not paid within 30 days.
K. Notwithstanding the above false alarm fee provisions, the alarm administrator will waive the first false alarm fee following the installation of an alarm system at a particular address. (Ord. 6345 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6252 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.120 Notice to alarm users of false alarms and suspension of police response.
A. The alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user in writing after each false alarm. The notice shall include either a warning or the amount of the fee for the false alarm, the fact that response will be suspended after the third false alarm during the one-year permit period (excluding duress, robbery, holdup and panic alarms) and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user.
B. The alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user in writing and the appropriate alarm installation company or monitoring company by electronic mail 30 days before an alarm response is to be suspended. The right of appeal under this chapter will be included with the notice. Suspension of alarm response in this subsection does not apply to duress, robbery, holdup and panic alarms. The notice of suspension must also include any fee due and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user and/or the alarm installation company or monitoring company. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.130 Violation of making alarm dispatch request for suspended alarm site.
A. The alarm administrator shall notify the police department of each alarm user whose alarm permit warrants suspension under the terms of this chapter. The alarm administrator shall suspend an alarm permit if it is determined that:
    1. The alarm user has had three or more false burglary alarms within the one-year permit period, except that the alarm administrator may waive a suspension of a permit upon receipt of documented work orders showing reasonable attempts to repair the alarm system prior to the notice of suspension. The alarm administrator may impose a one-week acclimation period upon reinstatement of the permit;
    2. There is a false statement of a material fact in the application for a permit; or
    3. The alarm user fails or refuses to pay a permit or permit renewal fee, false alarm fee or late fee assessed under this section.
B. It is a violation of this section for any person, firm, entity or company to operate a burglar alarm system during the period in which the alarm permit is suspended. It is a violation of this section for a monitoring company to make an alarm dispatch request to a burglar alarm site after the monitoring company’s alarm response manager (ARM) has been notified by electronic mail by the alarm administrator that the permit for that alarm site has been suspended. After three business days of the ARM’s notification the monitoring company shall be assessed a $100.00 fee for the first dispatch report and $200.00 for each dispatch request thereafter within the same suspension period. If the fee is not paid within 30 days after the invoice is mailed, a late fee in the amount of $25.00 is hereby imposed on the monitoring company.
C. If a person, firm, entity or company allows his/her/its security alarm license to lapse or be suspended, unless an appeal has been timely filed, it shall be presumed that the person, firm, entity or company does not have need of alarm responses from the police department. Depending on the circumstances, the police department may or may not respond to any alarm dispatch request from any alarm installation company or monitoring company where the security alarm license is lapsed or suspended unless there is a separate indication that there is a crime in progress. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.140 Appeals of determinations regarding alarm permits, security alarm license and fees.
A. If the alarm administrator assesses a fee, suspends an alarm permit, security alarm license or denies the issuance, renewal or reinstatement of an alarm permit or security alarm license, the alarm administrator shall send written notice of the action and a statement of the right to appeal to the affected applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company.
B. The alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company or other interested party may appeal any action described in subsection A of this section to the chief of police or designee by setting forth in writing the reasons for the appeal and delivering the appeal to the chief of police or designee within 20 business days after receipt of notice of the action. Failure to deliver the appeal within that time period is a waiver of the right to appeal.
C. The procedure for an appeal to the chief of police or designee is as follows:
    1. The applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company may file a written request for appeal by paying an appeal fee of $25.00 to the police department and setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The appeal must be entitled “Appeal from Alarm Administrator’s Action.” Appeal fees will be returned to the appealing party if the appeal is successful.
    2. The chief of police or designee shall conduct a hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request for review and shall consider the evidence submitted by the appealing party and the alarm administrator. The chief of police or designee must base the decision on the preponderance of evidence presented at the hearing and must render a decision within 15 days after the date of the hearing. The decision shall affirm or reverse the decision or action taken by the alarm administrator.
    3. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the chief of police or designee may appeal in accordance with the procedure set forth in ACC 18.70.050.
    4. Filing of an appeal stays any action by the alarm administrator to suspend an alarm permit or require the payment of a fee until the appeal process has been exhausted. This provision applies only to the action of the alarm administrator that is the subject of the appeal. This provision does not operate as a bar to enforcement action on violations of this section that occur thereafter.
D. The alarm administrator or the chief of police, or their respective designees, may adjust the count of false alarms or assessed fees based on:
    1. Evidence that a false alarm was caused by action of a communications services provider (i.e., telephone, cellular, cable company);
    2. Evidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage of more than four hours or severe weather such as a tornado or earthquake;
    3. Evidence that an alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm; or
    4. The occurrence of multiple alarms within a 24-hour period, which may be considered as one false alarm if the alarm user has taken corrective action, unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm user.
E. The alarm administrator may waive all of a false alarm fee or a part of the fee due to extenuating circumstances or to encourage corrective action.
F. On review of fees assessed to an alarm installation company or monitoring company, the alarm administrator, or, if appealed, chief of police, or designee, or the administrative hearing officer, may consider whether the alarm installation company or monitoring company has engaged in a consistent pattern of violations. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.150 Reinstatement of suspended alarm permits.
A. On the first suspension of a permit, a person, firm, entity or company whose alarm permit has been suspended may obtain reinstatement of the permit by the alarm administrator if the person, firm, entity or company:
    1. Submits a new application and pays a $50.00 reinstatement fee;
    2. Pays, or otherwise resolves, all outstanding fees and penalties;
    3. Submits a written notice from an alarm installation company stating that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired (if necessary) by the alarm installation company; and
    4. The alarm user successfully completes an electronic online alarm awareness class and test.
B. On the second and every subsequent suspension of a permit, reinstatement may be obtained by compliance with subsection (A) of this section and compliance with any of the following conditions that the alarm administrator may require:
    1. Proof that an employee of the alarm installation company or monitoring company caused the false alarm.
    2. Upgrade the alarm control panel to meet SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01.
    3. A written statement from an independent inspector designated by the chief of police or his designee that the alarm system has been inspected and is in good working order.
    4. Confirmation that all motion detectors are properly configured.
    5. Confirmation that the alarm system requires two independent zones to trigger before transmitting an alarm signal to the monitoring company.
    6. Confirmation that the alarm system requires two independent detectors to trigger before transmitting an alarm signal to the monitoring company.
    7. Certification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a listen-in device. This condition does not apply to residential property.
    8. Certification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a camera device. This condition does not apply to residential property.
    9. Certification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a person at the alarm site.
C. The police department shall reinstate its response to an alarm site as soon as is practicable after receiving notice of reinstatement from the alarm administrator. The alarm user and monitoring company shall take notice that the alarm site has been officially reinstated only after receiving notice from the alarm administrator of that fact. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.160 Suspension of police response to an alarm site.
A. In addition to the provisions in this chapter relating to lapsed, invalid and suspended security alarm licenses, following reasonable notice to the alarm user, as determined by the chief of police or designee, the chief of police or designee may suspend police responses to an alarm site if he/she determines that:
    1. There is a violation of this chapter by the alarm user; and/or
    2. There is a false statement of a material fact in the application for a permit; and/or
    3. The permitted alarm system has generated more than three false alarms during any permit period; and/or
    4. The alarm user has failed to pay an alarm permit fee or late fee, a late renewal fee or any fee assessed under this section, more than 30 days after the fee is due. This applies to all classifications of alarms including burglary, panic, duress, holdup and robbery.
    5. Depending on the circumstances, the police department may or may not respond to any alarm, where the alarm site is under suspension of police response.
B. Actions made pursuant to this section are not subject to administrative review.
C. The chief of police or designee may, for good cause shown, in his/her sole discretion, reinstate police response that has been suspended pursuant to this section. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.170 Revocation of security alarm license.
A. The chief of police or designee may revoke a security alarm license of an alarm installation company or monitoring company if he determines that:
    1. There is a violation of this chapter by the alarm installation company or monitoring company; and/or
    2. The alarm installation company or monitoring company has failed to pay any fee assessed under this section, more than 60 days after the fee is due.
B. Depending on the circumstances, the police department may or may not respond to any alarm, where the alarm installation company or monitoring company is under revocation.
C. A revocation made pursuant to this section is not subject to administrative review.
D. The chief of police or designee may, for good cause shown, reinstate a security alarm license that has been revoked pursuant to this section. An administrative fee of $100.00 shall be assessed as part of a security alarm license reinstatement. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.180 Police department response.
A. The police department will endeavor to respond to all alarm calls indicating that there is a duress, robbery, panic or burglar event in progress as promptly as possible, taking into account pending calls for service and any policy establishing priority of dispatched calls following notification of the receipt of the alarm from the monitoring company. Police supervisors may cancel police response to any or all alarms based on weather or other factors affecting police service needs.
B. The chief of police or designee may re-prioritize assignment of burglar alarms and response time at any time during a 24-hour period as may be necessary due to the service needs of the community. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.190 Confidentiality of alarm information.
The alarm administrator and the city of Auburn, and its/their employees, shall endeavor to hold all information contained in documents gathered through alarm registrations, customer lists and information in the alarm appeal process in confidence to the extent provided by law. Such information shall be deemed proprietary and confidential to the extent provided by law. Absent special circumstances, such information must not be released to the public or any person other than a law enforcement agency, third party administrator or the applicable alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company except pursuant to court order, or as required by law. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.200 Scope of police duty – Immunities preserved.
The issuance of alarm permits does not create a contract between the police department and/or the city and any alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, on the police department to respond to any alarm. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure of the police department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and full governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm permit, the alarm user acknowledges that the police department response is influenced by the availability of officers, priority of calls, traffic conditions, weather conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels, prior response history and administrative actions. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.30.210 Alternate enforcement.
In addition to the specific violations, fees and/or costs provided herein, failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter shall constitute a civil infraction punishable pursuant to Chapter 1.25 ACC. In any prosecution of such infraction it shall be prima facie evidence of the violation that the alarm system, at the same address and with the same owner or occupant, had a prior false alarm as indicated by the police, fire or other emergency response records of the prior false alarm. Additionally, failure to pay the fees imposed as set forth herein within 20 calendar days of the notice shall constitute a separate civil infraction punishable pursuant to Chapter 1.25 ACC. (Ord. 6216 § 1, 2009.)

9.94.010 Unlawful issuance of checks or drafts.
A. Any person who shall, with intent to defraud, make, or draw or utter, or deliver to another person any check or draft, on a bank or other depository for the payment of money, knowing at the time of such drawing or delivery that he has not sufficient funds in or credit with said bank or other depository to meet said check or draft, in full, upon its presentation, shall be guilty of unlawful issuance of bank check.

    1. Employers that meet the definition of “affected employer” in this chapter must identify themselves to the city within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries of the city or increasing employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees. Such newly affected employers that do not identify themselves within 90 days are in violation of this chapter.
    2. Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days from the date of identification to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city. Newly affected employers that do not perform a baseline measurement within 90 days of receiving such written notification that they are subject to this chapter are in violation of this chapter.
    3. Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to the city. The program will be developed in consultation with city of Auburn staff to be consistent with the goals of the city CTR plan. The program shall be implemented by the employer not more than 90 days after approval by the city. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties outlined in this chapter.
C. Change in Status as an Affected Employer. Any of the following changes in an employer’s status will change the employer’s CTR program requirements:
    1. If an affected employer can document that it faces an extraordinary circumstance that will change its status as an affected employer, it can apply for an exemption pursuant to ACC 10.02.100(A).
    2. If an employer initially designated as an affected employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees and expects not to employ 100 or more affected employees for the next 12 months, that employer is placed on a 12-month watch and is subject to the same program requirements as any other affected employer. At the end of the 12-month watch, if the employer no longer employs 100 or more affected employees, it is no longer an affected employer. It is the responsibility of the employer to notify the city that it is no longer an affected employer, and provide documentation to the city of its change in status. The burden of proof lies with the employer.
    3. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers.
    4. If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an “unaffected” employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. (Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.070 Requirements for employers.
An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and drive-alone commute trips. The CTR program must include the mandatory elements described herein.
A. Mandatory Program Elements. Each employer’s CTR program shall include the following mandatory elements:
    1. Employee Transportation Coordinator. The employer shall designate an employee transportation coordinator to administer the CTR program. The coordinator’s and/or designee’s name, location, and telephone number must be prominently displayed physically or electronically at each affected worksite. The coordinator shall oversee all elements of the employer’s CTR program and act as liaison between the employer and the city. The employee transportation coordinator must complete the basic ETC training course as provided by King County within six months of assuming the status of designated transportation coordinator, in order to help ensure consistent knowledge and understanding of CTR laws, rules and guidelines statewide. The objective is to have an effective transportation coordinator presence at each worksite; an affected employer with multiple sites may have one transportation coordinator for all sites.
    2. Information Distribution. Information about alternatives to drive-alone commuting shall be provided to employees at least once a year. This shall consist of, at a minimum, a summary of the employer’s CTR program, including ETC name and phone number. Employers must also provide a summary of their CTR program to all new employees at the time of hire. Each employer’s CTR program description and progress report must describe what information is to be distributed by the employer and the method of distribution.
    3. Description of Employer’s CTR Program. Each affected employer is required to submit a description of its CTR program to the city on the official form available from the public works department. The CTR program description presents the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for each goal year. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees’ commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other. At a minimum, the employer’s description must include:
        a. General description of each employment site location within the city limits, including transportation characteristics, surrounding services, and unique conditions experienced by the employer or its employees;
        b. Number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the worksite;
        c. Documentation of compliance with the mandatory CTR program elements as described in this section;
        d. Description of the additional elements included in the CTR program; and
        e. Schedule of implementation, assignment of responsibilities, and commitment to provide appropriate resources to carry out the CTR program.
B. CTR Program Report and Description. Affected employers shall review their programs and file a regular progress report with the city in accordance with the format provided by the city. The CTR program report and description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commuter trip reduction goals for the reporting period. At a minimum, the employer’s CTR program report and description must include:
    1. A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services;
    2. The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;
    3. Documentation of compliance with the mandatory CTR elements as described in this section;
    4. Description of any additional elements included in the employer’s CTR program;
    5. A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer’s established goals.
C. Biennial Measure of Employee Commute Behavior. In addition to the baseline measurement, employers shall conduct a program evaluation as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect commute trip reduction program employee questionnaires (surveys) at least once every two years, and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite.
D. Additional Program Elements. In addition to the specific CTR program elements described above, the employer’s CTR program shall include a set of measures designed to meet CTR goals. Measures may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:
    1. Provision of preferential parking or reduced parking charges, or both, for high-occupancy vehicles;
    2. Instituting or increasing parking charges for drive-alone vehicles;
    3. Provision of commute ride matching services to facilitate employee ride-sharing for commute trips;
    4. Provision of subsidies for rail, vanpool, or transit fares and/or transit passes;
    5. Provision of vans or buses for employee ridesharing;
    6. Provision of subsidies for carpools, vanpools, walking, bicycling, teleworking, or compressed schedules;
    7. Permitting the use of the employer’s vehicles for carpooling or vanpooling;
    8. Permitting flexible work schedules to facilitate employees’ use of transit, carpools, or vanpools;
    9. Cooperation with transportation providers to provide additional regular or express service to the worksite;
    10. Construction of special loading and unloading facilities for transit, carpool, and vanpool users;
    11. Provision of bicycle parking facilities, lockers, changing areas, and showers for employees who bicycle or walk to work;
    12. Provision of a program of parking incentives such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities;
    13. Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part – or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes;
    14. Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed work week which reduces commuting;
    15. Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities and emergency taxi services or guaranteed ride home programs;
    16. Provision of incentives for employees that do not drive alone to work;
    17. Charging employees for parking and/or the elimination of free parking; and
    18. Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site. (Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.080 Recordkeeping.
Affected employers shall maintain a copy of their approved CTR program description and report, their CTR program employee questionnaire results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to the city for a minimum of 48 months. The city and the employer shall agree on the recordkeeping requirements as part of the accepted CTR program. (Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.090 Annual reports.
Repealed by Ord. 6218. (Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.095 Program review and modifications.
The city shall provide the employer with written notification indicating whether a CTR program or progress report was approved or deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or progress report within 90 days of submission, the employer’s program or progress report is deemed accepted. The city may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer’s CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days.
A. An initial CTR program will be deemed acceptable if all required information on the CTR program form set forth in ACC 10.02.070 is provided. Upon review of an employer’s initial CTR program, the city shall establish the employer’s regular reporting date.
B. Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the city for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exist:
    1. The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or
    2. The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.
C. Program Modification Criteria. The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications:
    1. If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program;
    2. If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534 and this chapter, but has not met the applicable drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required.
D. The city may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer’s request for a program modification.
E. If an employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable drive-alone or VMT reduction goal, the city shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description and report, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The city shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the city will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the city within 10 working days of the conference. (Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999.)

10.02.100 Requests for exemptions or goal modifications of CTR requirements.
A. Employer Exemptions. An affected employer may submit a request to the city to grant an exemption from all CTR program requirements or penalties for a particular worksite. The employer must demonstrate that it would experience undue hardship in complying with the requirements of this chapter as a result of the characteristics of its business, its work force, or its location(s). An exemption may be granted if and only if the affected employer demonstrates that it faces extraordinary circumstances, such as bankruptcy, and is unable to implement measures that could reduce the proportion of drive-alone commute trips and VMT per employee. Exemptions may be granted by the city at any time based on written notice provided by the affected employer. The notice should clearly explain the conditions for which the affected employer is seeking an exemption from the requirements of the CTR program. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The city shall review annually all employers receiving exemptions and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following CTR program year.
B. Employee Exemptions. Specific employees or groups of employees who are required to drive alone to work as a condition of employment may be exempted from a worksite’s CTR program. Exemptions may also be granted for employees who work variable shifts throughout the year and who do not rotate as a group to identical shifts. The city will use the criteria identified in the CTR board administrative guidelines to assess the validity of employee exemption requests. The city shall grant or deny the request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The city shall review annually all employee exemption requests, and shall determine whether the exemption will be in effect during the following program year.
C. Goal Modification. 
    1. An affected employer may request that the city modify its CTR program goals. Such requests shall be filed in writing at least 60 days prior to the date the worksite is required to submit its program description and progress report. The goal modification request must clearly explain why the worksite is unable to achieve the applicable goal. The worksite must also demonstrate that it has implemented all of the elements contained in its approved CTR program.
    2. The city will review and grant or deny requests for goal modifications in accordance with procedures and criteria identified in the CTR board guidelines.
    3. An employer may not request a modification of the applicable goals until one year after the city approves its initial program description or annual report.
D. Modification of CTR Program Elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the city for modification of CTR program elements, other than the mandatory elements specified in this chapter, including recordkeeping requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exist:
    1. The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer; or
    2. The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship.
E. Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description or report, or to implement or modify a program for reasonable causes.
    1. Such requests shall be made in writing to the city’s public works director 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. In addition, all requests for extensions must be made prior to the due date anytime a program submission is going to be more than one week late. The city shall grant or deny the employer’s extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days.
    2. Extensions shall not exceed 90 days. Employers shall be limited to a total of 90 allowed extension days per year.
    3. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting CTR program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other CTR program elements.
    4. An employer’s regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer’s biennial reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the public works director.
    5. Implementation of Employer’s CTR Program. Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from the city that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from the city. (Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.110 Commute trip reduction certificate of leadership.
As public recognition for their efforts, employers with VMT per employee and proportion of drive-alone commute trips lower than the goal will receive a commute trip reduction certificate of leadership from the city. (Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.120 Appeals.
A. Employers may file a written appeal of final administrative decisions regarding the following actions:
    1. Rejection of an employer’s proposed CTR program.
    2. Denial of an employer’s request for a waiver or modification of any of the requirements under this chapter or a modification of the employer’s CTR program.
B. Appeals of the public works director’s determinations made pursuant to this chapter must be filed with the city’s public works department within 20 days after the final administrative decision is issued. Appeals shall be heard by the city’s hearing examiner in accordance with Chapter 2.46 ACC. Determinations on appeals shall be based on whether the decision being appealed was consistent with applicable state law and the guidelines of the State Task Force. The hearing examiner’s determination shall be final unless appealed to the superior court of the county in which the employer’s primary offices/facilities are located within the city of Auburn in accordance with the procedures in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598, and with the appeal being filed with the city clerk within 30 days after issuance of the decision of the hearing examiner. (Ord. 6442 § 5, 2012; Ord. 6218 § 1, 2010; Ord. 6182 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5246 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 4602 § 2, 1993.)

10.02.130 Enforcement.
A. Compliance. For purposes of this chapter, “compliance” shall mean:
    1. Submitting required reports and documentation at prescribed times;
    2. Fully implementing in good faith all provisions in an approved CTR program; and
    3. Distributing and collecting the CTR program employee questionnaire during the scheduled survey time period.
B. Violations. Any violation of this chapter shall be enforced pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1.25 ACC. The following actions shall constitute a violation of this chapter:
    1. Failure to implement an approved CTR program, unless the program elements that are carried out can be shown through quantifiable evidence to meet or exceed VMT and drive-alone commute goals as specified in this chapter. Failure to implement a CTR program includes but is not limited to:
        a. Failure of any affected employer to submit a complete CTR program within the deadlines specified in ACC 10.02.060 and 10.02.070;
        b. Failure to submit required documentation for annual reports;
        c. Submission of fraudulent data.
    2. Failure to modify a CTR program found to be unacceptable by the city under ACC 10.02.095(D).
    3. Failure to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(4) and this chapter.
    4. Failure to self-identify as an affected employer.
    5. Failure to perform a baseline measurement within the applicable deadline set forth in this chapter.
C. Penalties. 
    1. No affected employer with an approved CTR program may be held liable for failure to reach the applicable drive-alone commute or VMT goals.
    2. Each day of failure by an employer to comply with the requirements of this chapter shall constitute a separate violation, subject to penalties as described in Chapter 1.25 ACC.
D. Exemption from Civil Liability. An affected employer shall not be liable for civil penalties if failure to implement an element of a CTR program was the result of an inability to reach agreement with a certified collective bargaining agent under applicable laws where the issue was raised by the employer and pursued in good faith. Unionized employers shall be presumed to act in good faith compliance if they: (a) propose to a recognized union any provision of the employer’s CTR program that is subject to bargaining as defined by the National Labor Relations Act; and (b) advise the union of the existence of the statute and the mandates of the CTR program approved by the city and advise the union that the proposal being made is necessary for compliance with RCW 70.94.531.

10.08.010 Creation.
There is created and established within the city a traffic violations bureau to assist the court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city with the clerical work of traffic cases. The bureau shall be in charge of the finance director and shall be open at such hours and at such places as the mayor of the city, in consultation with the judge of the said court, may designate from time to time. The mayor of the city, after consultation with the judge, may appoint and designate one of the persons employed in the traffic violations bureau or a contract service provider as chief traffic violations clerk. (Ord. 6429 § 14, 2012; Ord. 4538 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991; 1957 code § 9.03.010.)

10.08.020 Bail forfeitures.
In traffic matters where a bail forfeiture is authorized by the revised bail schedule of the court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city, a form provided by said court will be prepared in triplicate by the clerk of the traffic violations bureau. The original will be stapled to the permanent violations bureau copy of the uniform traffic citation and complaint. The remaining two copies will be taken with payment of the bail and driver education penalty directly to the finance director of the city, where payment in full will be made. The finance director will thereupon complete the finance director’s items on the form, keep one copy for his files, and at least weekly will return the third copy of such form to the clerk of the traffic violations bureau. The clerk will staple such third copy to the permanent violations bureau copy of the uniform traffic citation and complaint and will file them in numerical sequence in the permanent files of the bureau. The clerk of the traffic violations bureau will complete the disposition of items on the reverse side of the remaining copies of the citations and will dispatch them at least weekly to the appropriate agencies. (Ord. 6429 § 14, 2012; Ord. 4538 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991; 1957 code § 9.03.020.)

10.08.030 Personal recognizance bond execution duties.
In traffic matters where trial is requested or is mandatory, according to the reversed bail schedule, the clerk of the traffic violations bureau is authorized to allow violators to execute and complete a form of personal recognizance bond, as provided by the court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city. The clerk will thereupon send all copies of the traffic citation and complaint together with the executed personal recognizance bond to said court for docketing, trial and disposition. (Ord. 6429 § 14, 2012; Ord. 4538 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991; 1957 code § 9.03.030.)

10.08.040 Post-trial procedures.
Following trial on the merits, if a finding of “not guilty” is made, a docket entry to this effect shall be made and the personnel of the court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city will complete all actions. If, after trial on the merits, a defendant is found guilty and a fine and driver education penalty is assessed, the clerk of said court will prepare a form in four copies keeping the original with the court. The remaining copies shall be given to the defendant immediately with instructions to take or send payment of his fine and penalty in full within a definitely stated period directly to the finance director of the city. Upon payment, the finance director will complete the finance director’s items on the form, keep one copy for his files, and, at least weekly, will return the third copy of the form to the court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city where the remaining necessary actions will be completed. (Ord. 6429 § 14, 2012; Ord. 4538 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991; 1957 code § 9.02.040.)

10.08.050 Driver education penalty remittances.
The finance director will make remittance of the state driver education penalty periodically, as required, directly to the state treasurer. (Ord. 6429 § 14, 2012; Ord. 4538 § 1 (Exh. A), 1991; 1957 code § 9.30.050.)

10.08.060 Limitations.
The procedures set out in this chapter will not apply in the case of criminal matters not involving traffic violations. The court of limited jurisdiction authorized to hear cases of the city will process those cases. Likewise, in the case of persons charged and booked in the county jail and where bail is posted at the jail, present procedures will remain in effect. (Ord. 6429 § 14, 2012; Ord. 4538 § 1 (Exh.

    2. “Park,” “parking,” “stop,” “stand” or “standing” means the halting of a vehicle, other than an emergency vehicle, whether occupied or not, except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or fire official or traffic-control sign or signal.

    1. Lanes shall provide a minimum, unobstructed continuous width of 20 feet and a minimum vertical clearance of 13 feet, 6 inches.
    2. Fire lanes shall be either asphalt or reinforced concrete, or when specifically authorized by the fire department, compacted crushed rock may be used.
    3. Where fire lanes connect to city streets or parking lots, adequate clearances and turning radii shall be provided. All proposed plans must have fire department approval.
C. Fire Lanes as Part of Driveways and/or Parking Areas. The fire department may require that areas specified for use as driveways or private thoroughfares shall not be used for parking. These areas, when specified, shall be marked or identified by one of the two means detailed in subsection E of this section.
D. Parking in a Fire Lane Prohibited. Except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic, or in compliance with the direction of a police officer or fire official or traffic-control sign, signal or device, no person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle, whether occupied or not, in a designated fire lane.

E. Fire Lane Identification. Lanes shall be identified by a four-inch-wide line or by painting of the curb in bright yellow color. Marking shall be by one of the following methods:
    1. Fire lane signs (in accordance with the Washington State Highway Commission Sign Fabrication Manual M24-70 HT and the Manual of Uniform Traffic-Control Devices issued by the Federal Highway Administration), per illustration:

    3. Alternate Materials and Methods. The city may modify its method of marking fire lanes if the provisions of this section are impractical. This includes authorizing the city engineer to include references to codes and/or ordinances on the signs, but the inclusion or exclusion of that or any other language shall not affect the enforceability of the fire lane restrictions so long as the sign clearly identifies a fire lane and is in accordance with the Washington State Highway Commission Sign Fabrication Manual M24-70 HT and the Manual of Uniform Traffic-Control Devices issued by the Federal Highway Administration.
F. Existing Buildings. When the fire department determines that a hazard due to inaccessibility of fire apparatus exists around existing buildings, they may require fire lanes to be constructed and maintained as detailed in subsections B and C of this section.
G. Violation. It is a violation of this section for any person, firm or individual to sign or to attempt to designate an unauthorized fire zone.
H. Penalties. Any person violating any of the provisions of this section has committed an infraction and shall be fined $75.00. (Ord. 6247 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5724 § 1, 2002; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. F), 1999; Ord. 5110 § 2, 1998; Ord. 4188 §§ 1 – 9, 1986.)

10.36.190 Commercial vehicles and large vehicles.
A. Except as provided for in this section, parking any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 16,000 pounds or more, as indicated on the vehicle or in the records of the Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles for the vehicle, on any street, alley or public right-of-way in the city is prohibited.
B. Parking vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 16,000 pounds or more, as indicated on the vehicle or as indicated in the records of the Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles, is permitted for vehicles displaying a valid city-issued large truck parking permit on the lower half of the driver’s side door. Vehicles must be registered to an Auburn, Washington, resident with an Auburn, Washington, business license within the corporate limits of the city, as set forth below.
    1. Truck parking on public streets is only allowed with a valid city issued truck parking permit at the following locations:
        a. D Street NW both sides, between 44th Street NW and S 277th Street, where legal;

Proof of residency of the owner or lessee of a vehicle must be presented when applying for a permit. The applicant shall sign and certify the information furnished on the application. The permit holder shall report any changes of address or changes in vehicle registration. A change of residential or business address to outside the corporate limits of the city of Auburn shall require surrender of the permit to the city.
    3. Only city of Auburn residents with a valid Auburn, Washington, business license for a business located within the corporate limits of the city are eligible for a permit. Eligible residents are limited to one large truck parking permit. “Resident” as used in this chapter applies only to a person who lives in a residence, and does not include a person occupying property used exclusively as a place of business, or occupying property used for any other purpose other than as the person’s place of abode.
    4. Permits shall be automatically revoked or suspended upon revocation or suspension of the resident’s business license, and shall be valid only as long as the resident’s business license is valid. A permit holder shall surrender such permit to the city upon written notification. Failure to surrender a permit, when so requested, shall be a violation of law subject to the process and penalties in Chapter 1.25 ACC. 
    5. A permit shall be valid for a calendar year and will renew automatically when the permit holder’s business license is renewed, unless the permit holder requests otherwise. At its discretion, the city may simultaneously issue to a resident parking permits for two calendar years if also issuing to that resident business licenses covering two calendar years.
    6. Once granted, a permit shall be effective for the vehicle identified upon the resident’s permit application and it shall not be assignable or transferable to any other vehicle. A displayed parking permit shall be valid only in the locations described in this section. The permit does not guarantee a parking space nor shall it exempt the vehicle or operator from other regulations of this code. If a permit has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the city will reissue the permit if the resident’s business license is currently valid.
    7. To be valid, a permit shall be affixed in a permanent fashion by its adhesive face to the lower half of the driver’s side door of the vehicle.
C. Commercial vehicles may be stopped or parked in other safe locations while in the process of actively loading, unloading or providing services to residences or businesses in the immediate vicinity of where the vehicle is parked; provided, that the free flow of traffic is unobstructed.
D. The penalty for parking in violation of this section shall be a fine of $250.00 per violation, in addition to other costs and assessments provided by law. A violation of this section shall be considered a parking infraction and shall be processed in accordance with the state statutes, court rules and city ordinances regarding parking infractions. Each calendar day during which a violation occurs shall constitute a separate infraction, and each instance when a commercial vehicle parks at a location in violation of this section shall be a separate violation.
E. The provisions of this section do not apply to recreational vehicles as regulated by ACC 10.36.191. Additionally, parking larger vehicles on or along certain arterial streets within residential zoning districts is further regulated by ACC 10.36.193.

10.36.193 Larger vehicles in residential zoning districts.
A. In addition to the parking regulations and restrictions set forth in this chapter, no person shall park any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or more, as indicated in the records of the Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles for the vehicle, on or along any street, alley or public right-of-way in a residential zoning district of the city; provided, that this restriction shall not apply to pick-up trucks falling within the Class 3 truck classification with a gross vehicle weight rating not exceeding 14,000 pounds. The provisions of this section do not apply to parking on or along principal arterials or minor arterials as designated in the city’s transportation comprehensive plan. The provisions of this section, however, do apply to parking on or along city streets in residential zoning districts that are classified as local streets or collector arterials as designated in the city’s transportation comprehensive plan.
B. For the purposes hereof, the Class 3 truck classification shall be as defined and categorized by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey (VIUS) standards, which groups Class 1, 2 and 3 as “Light Duty.” Additionally, for the purposes hereof, the term “pick-up truck” means and refers to a motor vehicle designed for carrying or pulling loads with an open body and low sides, consistent with the colloquial understanding of that term.
C. As used in this section, a street, alley or public right-of-way in a residential zoning district of the city means and refers to any public rights-of-way within the residential zones of the city as defined and described in ACC 18.07.010, including specifically the Residential Conservancy (RC) Zone; the R-1 Residential Zone; the R-5 Residential Zone; the R-7 Residential Zone; the R-10 Residential Zone; the R-16 Residential Zone; and the R-20 Residential Zone. Also, mixed-use zoning districts, where residential and nonresidential uses may be made of property therein as a matter of right (not requiring a conditional or special use permit) shall not constitute a residential zoning district of the city for the purposes hereof. In order for a street, alley or public right-of-way to be considered as being in a residential zoning district of the city, the property on both sides of the roadway shall be zoned RC, R-1, R-5, R-7, R-10, R-16 and/or R-20.
D. The provisions of this section do not apply to recreational vehicles as regulated by ACC 10.36.191.
E. The penalty for parking in violation of this section shall be a fine of $250.00 per violation, in addition to other costs and assessments provided by law. A violation of this section shall be considered a parking infraction and shall be processed in accordance with the state statutes, court rules and city ordinances regarding parking infractions. Each calendar day during which a violation occurs shall constitute a separate infraction, and each instance when a commercial vehicle parks at a location in violation of this section shall be a separate violation.

B. It is a violation of this section to stop, stand or park a vehicle on a street, highway, alley or public property within the city limits of the city with switched license plates or switched license plate tabs (license plates/tabs belonging on another vehicle).
C. It is a violation of this section to stop, stand or park a vehicle on a street, highway, alley or public property within the city limits of the city without current, properly displayed month and year license tabs.
D. Penalty. Any violation of this section shall be an infraction and punishable as follows:
    1. For violations of subsections A and B of this section, by a monetary penalty of $86.00.
    2. For violation of subsection C of this section, when the license tabs have been expired up to 45 days, by a monetary penalty of $86.00.
    3. For violation of subsection C of this section, when the license tabs have been expired more than 45 days, by a monetary penalty of $101.00.
    Provided, that any vehicle with license tabs expired more than 45 days is also subject to immediate impoundment by a law enforcement officer in accordance with RCW 46.55.113(2).

    1. When any landscape strip permitted under ACC 10.36.270(A)(10) is permitted to be utilized for parking, the duty, burden, and expense of the maintenance and general upkeep of such landscape strip shall be the responsibility of the owner of the private property directly abutting the landscape strip.
    2. The parking area associated with a landscape strip shall be free of conflicts with utilities, fire hydrants, and landscaping as determined by the city engineer, and notwithstanding and in addition to any other provisions, no parking shall be permitted on any landscape strip within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, street tree or driveway cut.
    3. A parked vehicle shall not obstruct the traveled way of the street, the sidewalk, or any other pedestrian pathways and be located in a way that does not impede sight distance for other vehicles or pedestrians from exiting or entering driveways or side streets.
    4. The owner shall not allow any material to be tracked onto the city street, such as mud, gravel, or other debris.
    5. For construction of any new landscape strips, or reconstruction of existing landscape strips allowed for parking, the owner of the private property directly abutting the landscape strip shall utilize a surface material that allows stormwater to be absorbed, filtered, and cleaned before discharging to the groundwater. As determined by the city engineer, materials such as brick, interlocking pavers, grassblock, turfblock, gravel, or porous concrete/asphalt/pavement are acceptable materials.
    6. The provisions hereof may be enforced by the city’s police department for parking violations or other criminal violations or traffic infractions, or by the city’s code enforcement officers for compliance with maintenance and repair requirements, or either the police and code enforcement departments, jointly or separately, where appropriate.
B. The above duties and responsibilities shall continue so long as the landscape strip is able to be used for parking in compliance with city standards; provided, that the property owner may request in writing of the city engineer that the landscape strip abutting his or her property no longer be used for parking. The city engineer shall evaluate any such request and determine what measures the property owner must take to restore the landscape strip to a functional landscape area to remove it from availability for parking. The city engineer shall also be authorized to evaluate any other steps appropriate for such transition. (Ord. 6275 § 3, 2010.)

10.36.216 Parked vehicle obstructing other vehicles.
It is unlawful for any person to stop, park, or angle park any vehicle upon a roadway in such a manner or under such conditions as to block another vehicle in or prevent access to or movement of another vehicle. Evidence that a driver of a vehicle has parked or positioned his or her vehicle within two feet of a previously parked vehicle is prima facie evidence of a violation of this section. It is provided, however, that before a citation is issued or a vehicle is towed for violation of this section, the city shall receive a complaint from the owner or operator of a vehicle whose access or movement is prevented. (Ord. 6364 § 1, 2011.)

A. Law enforcement officers of the city of Auburn and persons commissioned by the Auburn police chief are authorized to use automated traffic cameras and related automated systems to detect one or more of the following: (1) stoplight violations; (2) railroad crossing violations; and (3) school speed zone violations.
B. The use of automated traffic safety cameras is subject to the following restrictions:
    1. Use of traffic safety cameras is restricted to “two arterial intersections” (the intersections of two arterials), railroad crossings, and school speed zones only;
    2. Automated traffic safety cameras may only take pictures of the vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while an infraction is occurring. Pictures taken by automated traffic safety cameras may not reveal the face of the driver or of the passengers in the vehicle.
C. The city shall clearly mark all locations where automated traffic safety cameras are in use by placing signs in locations that clearly indicate to a driver that he or she is entering a zone where traffic laws are enforced by an automated traffic safety camera.
D. For the purposes of this chapter, “automated traffic safety camera” means a device that uses a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with an intersection traffic control system, a railroad grade crossing control system, or a speed measuring device, and a camera synchronized to automatically record one or more sequenced photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images of the rear of a motor vehicle at the time the vehicle fails to stop when facing a steady red traffic control signal or an activated railroad grade crossing control signal, or exceeds a speed limit to a school speed zone as detected by a speed measuring device. (Ord. 5957 § 1, 2005.)

10.42.020 Notice of infraction for automated traffic control systems.
A. Whenever any vehicle is photographed by an automatic traffic safety camera, a notice of infraction shall be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle within 14 days of the violation, or to the renter of a vehicle within 14 days of establishing the renter’s name and address under this section.
B. If the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental car business, the law enforcement agency shall, before a notice of infraction is issued, provide a written notice to the rental car business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business if the rental car business does not, within 18 days of receiving the written notice, provide to the issuing agency by return mail: (1) a statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or (2) a statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who was driving or renting the vehicle at the time the infraction occurred; or (3) in lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business may pay the applicable penalty. Timely mailing of this statement to the issuing law enforcement agency relieves a rental car business of any liability under this chapter for the notice of infraction.
C. The law enforcement officer issuing the notice of infraction shall include with it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotos, or electronic images produced by an automated traffic safety camera, stating the facts supporting the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a violation under this chapter. (Ord. 5957 § 1, 2005.)

10.42.030 Request for hearing.

A. In a traffic infraction case involving an infraction detected through the use of a photo enforcement system under RCW 46.63.160 or detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera under this chapter, proof that the particular vehicle described in the notice of traffic infraction was in violation of any such provision of RCW 46.63.160, together with proof that the person named in the notice of traffic infraction was at the time of the violation the registered owner of the vehicle, constitutes in evidence a prima facie presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person in control of the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred.
B. This presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states, under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony before the court that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care, custody, or control of some person other than the registered owner. (Ord. 5957 § 1, 2005.)

10.42.050 Infractions processed.
Infractions detected through the use of automated traffic safety cameras are not part of the registered owner’s driving record under RCW 46.52.101 and 46.52.120. Additionally, infractions generated by the use of automated traffic safety cameras under this chapter shall be processed in the same manner as parking infractions prosecuted under city codes, including for the purposes of RCW 3.50.100, 3.62.040, 46.16.216, and 46.20.270, and any other applicable statutes.

12.48.070 Hearing – Required – Notice.
Upon receipt of the staff report from the city, the city council shall pass a resolution calling for a public hearing to consider the proposed vacation, which hearing shall be not more than 60 days nor less than 20 days after the date of passage of such resolution. The city clerk shall give 20 days’ notice of the pendency of the petition by written notice posted in three of the most public places in the city, and a like notice in a conspicuous place on the right-of-way sought to be vacated. The notice shall contain a statement that a petition has been filed to vacate the right-of-way described in the notice, together with a statement of the time and place fixed for the hearing thereon.
In all cases where the proceeding is initiated by resolution of the city without a petition having been signed by the owners of more than two-thirds of the property abutting upon the right-of-way to be vacated, in addition to the notice hereinabove required, there shall be given by mail at least 15 days before the date fixed for the hearing, a similar notice to the owners or reputed owners of all lots, tracts, or parcels of land or other property abutting upon any right-of-way sought to be vacated, as shown on the rolls of the county treasurer, directed to the address thereon shown. If 50 percent of abutting property owners file written objection to the proposed vacation with the clerk prior to the time of hearing, the city shall be prohibited from proceeding with the resolution. (Ord. 6085 § 1, 2007; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. G), 1999; 1957 code § 8.24.070.)

12.48.080 Hearing – Procedure – Vacation ordinance.
At the time appointed for the hearing of the right-of-way vacation petition, or at such time as the hearing may be adjourned to by the city council, the same shall be heard, and if the council determines to grant the petition, or any part thereof, the council shall authorize by ordinance the vacation of such right-of-way, or any portion thereof. Such ordinance may provide for the retention by the city of all easements or rights in respect to the vacated land for the construction, repair and maintenance of public utilities and services; provided, that the city council may, if no vested rights are impaired, modify, change, omit or add provisions or stipulations as a condition to the granting of petitions for vacations. When the city council deems it to the best interest of the city, it may waive all or any part of the additional costs and expenses provided for in this chapter with respect to any vacation; provided, that all conditions with respect to such vacation shall be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the city prior to the time of the introduction of an ordinance vacating a right-of-way, or all such conditions with respect to such vacation shall be fulfilled as specified in said ordinance prior to the ordinance becoming effective. Upon final passage of a right-of-way vacation ordinance, copies shall be distributed by the city clerk to all city departments having an interest in the ordinance. (Ord. 6085 § 1, 2007; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. G), 1999; Ord. 3617 § 2, 1981.)

12.48.085 Compensation.
The city council may require as a condition of the ordinance that the city be compensated for the vacated right-of-way in an amount which does not exceed one-half the value of the right-of-way so vacated, except in the event the subject property or portions thereof were acquired at public expense or have been part of a dedicated public right-of-way for 25 years or more, compensation may be required in an amount equal to the full value of the right-of-way being vacated. The city engineer shall estimate the value of the right-of-way to be vacated based on the assessed values of comparable properties in the vicinity. If the value of the right-of-way is determined by the city engineer to be $2,000 or less, the applicant will not be required to provide the city with a formal appraisal. If the value of the right-of-way is determined by the city engineer to be greater than $2,000, the applicant will be required to provide the city with an appraisal by an MAI appraiser approved by the city engineer, at the expense of the applicant. The city reserves the right to have a second appraisal performed at the city’s expense. (Ord. 6085 § 1, 2007.)

12.48.090 Petition denial or abandonment.
The right-of-way vacation petition shall be considered abandoned if the vacation conditions have not been met, including payment of compensation, within the time period identified in the ordinance, or if no such time period is identified, within 180 days of approval of the ordinance. The city may extend this deadline if they determine the petitioner has made a good faith effort to meet the conditions.
In the event that the city council, at the conclusion of the public hearing thereon, denies the requested right-of-way vacation petition, or that such vacation proceedings should be abandoned by the petitioner, the petitioner shall be relieved from the obligation to fulfill conditions of the ordinance. The city shall notify the interested city departments if a vacation proceeding is abandoned by the petitioner prior to the city council hearing on the petition. If a vacation petition is disapproved by the city council or abandoned by the petitioner after the council hearing, such notification shall be given by the city clerk.

B. The city, with respect to rights-of-way within the city’s jurisdiction, may restrict or prohibit the operation thereon of trucks or any other vehicles, except school buses, public transit and emergency vehicles, or may impose weight limits, determine haul routes for local trips, or place any other restrictions as may be deemed necessary, including when the city determines that any right-of-way would be seriously damaged or destroyed by climatic conditions, deficient structural integrity, or any other conditions if unrestricted use is continued.
In the event the city determines the project, program, or activity for which the person, company, corporation, enterprise or entity is using said rights-of-way will create unusual wear and tear on the right-of-way, or significant impacts to public safety, the environment, traffic, and noise, and for all projects that require mitigation of hauling and related impacts within the city, the person, company, corporation, enterprise or entity using the right-of-way may request a right-of-way use permit, which identifies the specific restrictions, prohibitions, and conditions of use.

B. The city is authorized to order correction or discontinuance of any such condition or activities following the methods specified in procedures adopted pursuant to this code.
C. The city shall also have all powers and remedies which may be available under state law, this code, and procedures adopted hereunder for securing the correction or discontinuance of any condition specified in this section.

Notice of such removal shall be thereafter given to the owner, if known. This section does not apply to motor vehicles;
    7. All expenses incurred by the city in abating the condition or any portion thereof shall constitute a civil debt owing to the city jointly and severally by such persons who have been given notice or who own the object or placed it in the right-of-way, which debt shall be collectible in the same manner as any other civil debt;
    8. The city shall also have all powers and remedies which may be available under law, this code and procedures adopted hereunder for securing the correction or discontinuance of any conditions specified by the city. (Ord. 6125 § 1, 2007.)

12.64A.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to:
A. Establish the city’s authority to require an applicant for a building, grading and/or special permit to make reasonable public street improvements or defer said improvements through an agreement process or pay a fee in lieu of those improvements;
B. Establish procedures to determine when applicants for building, grading and/or special permit applicants will be required to provide public improvements;
C. Establish criteria to be used to determine the nature, extent and location of required public improvements;
D. Promote the development of the city’s transportation infrastructure in conformance with the city’s comprehensive plan and design standards, in order to avoid public harm or the creation of nuisance situations. (Ord. 6705 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 6083 § 2, 2007.)

12.64A.020 Applicability of chapter.
Any building, grading or special permit meeting one or more of the following criteria will include a requirement that the permittee construct or otherwise provide public right-of-way improvements as required in ACC 12.64A.030.
A. Four residential dwelling units or less, and the proposed improvements add one or more units on the subject property. For the purposes of this condition, an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is not considered a unit; or
B. Commercial development, industrial development, or residential development with more than four dwelling units, when the proposed improvements add one or more units and increase the net building square footage of the existing structure(s) on the subject property; or
C. Commercial development, industrial development, or residential development with more than four dwelling units, where no additional units are being added and when the proposed improvements increase net building square footage on the subject property by 10 percent or 1,000 square feet, whichever is lower; or
D. Drive-through service is added on the subject property; or
E. A standalone parking lot is added on the subject property. For the purposes of this condition, a standalone parking lot is a parking lot that is not designated to meet parking requirements of a building or other improvement located on the same parcel; or

This requirement does not apply to a relocation or modification of an access used for only a single-family residence if the access change connects to the same public right-of-way. The city engineer may waive this requirement in circumstances where the city engineer determines that the access is being modified to address safety deficiencies associated with the existing access.

    B. Sidewalks;
    C. Curb and gutter;
    D. Street landscaping;
    E. Street lighting and conduit;
    F. Storm drainage;
    G. Dedication of public right-of-way;
    H. Conduit for city communication systems.
The city engineer will determine whether one or more of the following public right-of-way improvements are needed to mitigate the impacts of a permitted action set forth in ACC 12.64A.020:
    A. Additional street lighting;
    B. Additional storm drainage systems;
    C. Traffic control and other safety systems including, but not limited to, roadway channelization, signage, nonmotorized safety, and traffic calming;
    D. Dedication of public right-of-way on public street frontages without vehicular or nonmotorized access. (Ord. 6705 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 6414 § 1, 2012; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6112 § 1, 2007; Ord. 6083 § 2, 2007.)

12.64A.040 Construction.
Unless a deferral or fee in lieu of improvements is granted under ACC 12.64A.050, applicants for a building, grading or special permit will construct said improvements in conformance with the public facility extension requirements of Chapter 13.40 ACC. (Ord. 6705 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 6083 § 2, 2007.)

12.64A.050 Deferral and fee in lieu of improvements.
A. The city engineer may grant a deferral or payment of fee in lieu of improvements for some or all of the improvements required under this chapter on receipt of a written request from the applicant, or may require a deferral or payment of fee in lieu of improvements for some or all of the required improvements. Dedication of necessary right-of-way may not be deferred or satisfied through payment of a fee in lieu. The city engineer’s decision regarding deferral or payment of a fee in lieu will take into account, among other considerations, the following criteria:
    1. Proximity to or lack of similar improvements within the roadway corridor;
    2. Continuity of infrastructure improvements within the public right-of-way;
    3. Pending projects programmed within the corridor that may impact the street frontage of the subject property;
    4. Safety considerations;
    5. Traffic volumes and travel patterns;
    6. Storm drainage needs;
    7. Input from the police; parks, arts, and recreation; community development department; information services; and the local fire authority.
B. For those improvements either deferred or for which a fee in lieu is paid, the applicant will be required to:
    1. Execute and record an agreement not to protest the formation of a future local improvement district (LID) formed for the construction of those improvements; and
    2. Execute and record an agreement to defer the completion of the required improvements by the applicant until the city determines the improvements are needed; or
    3. Pay a fee in lieu of improvements based on the city’s estimated costs to complete the required improvements. The city will have the discretion to require payment of a fee in lieu of improvements instead of the execution and recording of deferral agreements when the street improvements are part of an identified project in the city’s six-year transportation improvement program or other documentation, and the funds can immediately be used for design or construction efforts, or to leverage additional grant funding for the project; or
    4. Execute a combination of a deferral and payment of a fee in lieu of improvements as long as the applicant’s combined obligation does not exceed the extent of the total requirements for those improvements.
C. The applicant has the right under state law to protest the applicant’s assessment for any LID at the time of the final assessment roll public hearing.
D. For those improvements that are deferred, the design standards and construction standards in place at the time of improvements will be applied. (Ord. 6705 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6112 § 2, 2007; Ord. 6083 § 2, 2007.)

12.64A.060 Appeal and enforcement.
A. Appeals of determinations by the city engineer made pursuant to this chapter must be filed with the city’s public works director within 20 working days after the final city engineer decision is issued. The public works director will have 15 working days to review the appeal, decide whether to uphold or modify the city engineer’s decision, and notify the applicant of such decision.
B. Appeals of decisions of the public works director made pursuant to this chapter will be filed with the public works department within 20 working days after the date of the notice of the public works director’s decision. Appeals will be heard by the city’s hearing examiner pursuant to Chapter 2.46 ACC. Decisions of the hearing examiner will be based on whether the decision being appealed was consistent with applicable state law and city codes.
C. Appeals of decisions of the hearing examiner under this chapter will be final unless appealed to the superior court of the county in which the proposed public improvements are located within the city of Auburn. The appeals must be filed under the procedures in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598. The notice of appeal of the hearing examiner’s decision will be filed with the city clerk within 30 days after issuance of the decision of the hearing examiner.
D. When appealing a determination under this chapter, at any stage of appeal, the applicant/appellant must indicate if the appeal pertains to:
    1. The determination of the required improvements in the public right-of-way;
    2. The determination to require or deny a deferral of said improvements; and/or
    3. The determination to require the payment of a fee in lieu for a deferral instead of an executed and recorded agreement.
E. The associated building, grading or special permit will not be issued until all appeals are concluded. (Ord. 6705 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018; Ord. 6442 § 7, 2012; Ord. 6182 § 2, 2008; Ord. 6083 § 2, 2007.)

13.06.364 Nonlienable property class of utility customers.
A. There is hereby created a class of utility customers where the customers receiving water utility services are receiving such services at property for which the city does not have the right to lien the property for nonpayment of utility services. The utility rates for such customers shall be as set forth in ACC 13.06.360; provided, that the city can also collect a utility services deposit as described as follows:
    1. The dollar amount of four months of the current water base rate plus the cost of estimated measure of ccf’s (commodity use) during this time frame; and
    2. The sum of the current rate for three late fees, one shut off fee, and one meter removal fee.
B. For the purposes hereof, “nonlienable property” means property which is owned or held by a governmental or nongovernmental entity in such a way that it is immune from utility lien collection efforts of the city.
C. This new class of utility customers shall include new customers – new applications for utility services on nonlienable property and existing and former customers of utility services on nonlienable property whose utility services have been terminated for nonpayment or whose accounts have been referred to collection or to other utility payment enforcement services or personnel for nonpayment of utility services.

13.06.366 Waiver of deposit for nonlienable property class of utility customers – Appeal.
A. In connection with the utility services deposit for the nonlienable property class of utility customers as described in ACC 13.06.364, the finance director is authorized to grant a full or partial waiver to said utility customer from the deposit requirement where special humanitarian or health circumstances exist with respect to said utility customer’s receipt of utility services. The finance director shall have the sole discretion to grant such waivers, and determine if they shall be full or partial waivers, where such circumstances are found by the finance director to exist. If the waiver is granted, no deposit or only a reduced deposit shall be required.
B. If any person or entity has applied for a waiver of the deposit requirement and has been denied the requested waiver, such person or entity may appeal the decision denying the requested waiver by filing with the city clerk a notice of appeal, which notice of appeal must be received by the city clerk within 30 days of the decision denying the requested waiver. The appeal shall be based solely on whether special humanitarian or health circumstances exist with respect to the utility customer’s receipt of utility services, and shall be heard by a panel of department directors of the city (excluding the finance director) appointed by the mayor. The decision of the panel of department directors shall be final, and no further appeals shall be allowed.
C. For the purposes hereof, the finance director and mayor shall utilize, as a guide in addressing requests for waivers, the criteria utilized in granting low income disabled citizen discounts and low income senior citizen discounts for utility customers of the city. (Ord. 6439 § 7, 2012.)

13.08.010 Chapter purpose.
This chapter regulating the extension of and payment for water mains is for the purpose of uniformity in establishing extreme limits of water mains, and is to promote fairness among the abutting property owners on both sides of streets on which water mains are located and to avoid public harm or creation of nuisance situations. (Ord. 5850 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. H), 1999; Ord. 4776 § 1, 1995; 1957 code § 10.10.010.)

13.08.015 Definitions.
A. “City of Auburn design and construction standards” means the requirements adopted under Chapter 12.04 ACC for storm drainage, sanitary sewer, street, and water design and construction.
B. “Local improvement district” means a method of assessing benefiting properties in financing needed capital improvements through formation of special assessment districts. (Ord. 5850 § 1, 2004.)

13.08.020 Supervision and extent.
All persons or local improvement districts desiring to extend city water mains in the city must extend the same under the supervision of the city engineer. All extensions shall extend to and across the full width of the property served with water. No property shall be served with city water unless the water main is extended to the extreme boundary limit of the property line extending the full length of the front footage of the property. (Ord. 5850 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. H), 1999; 1957 code § 10.10.020.)

13.08.030 Main installation – Cost liability – Specifications.
In all cases where property owners are required to extend water mains, the property owner to be served shall pay for the installation cost of the water mains. All water mains to be installed within the city’s water service area shall be sized in accordance with the city’s comprehensive water plan and the city of Auburn design and construction standards. (Ord. 5850 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. H), 1999; 1957 code § 10.10.030.)

13.08.040 Oversizing.
When it is deemed necessary by the city to install major transmission lines larger than are required to serve adjacent properties for domestic, industrial or fire protection purposes, the city may, pursuant to a written agreement between the city and the developer negotiated in advance to any work, compensate the developer for the difference in cost of the oversizing, if the extension is economically feasible for the city.

13.14.010 Purpose.
It is in the public interest to promote the conservation of the city’s water supply in order to protect the health, welfare, and safety of water users. To accomplish this declared purpose, the city reserves the right to exercise its police powers through emergency measures as set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 5787 § 1, 2003.)

13.14.020 Authority.
The mayor, when necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, shall have the authority to declare various stages of water emergencies and to implement the water conservation measures set forth in this chapter. The mayor shall also have authority to determine whether the various stages of water emergencies and water conservation measures apply to the entire city utility service area or to such portions as may be particularly affected. (Ord. 5787 § 1, 2003.)

13.14.030 Policies and procedures.
The following policies and procedures shall apply during the various stages of water emergencies as set forth in this section:
A. Stage I – Anticipated Water Shortage – Internal Preparations. The mayor may declare a Stage I water emergency when a water shortage is anticipated but not immediate. The public works department shall conduct public education efforts regarding the benefits and necessity of conservation by the public.
B. Stage II – Serious Water Shortage – Voluntary Conservation. The mayor may declare a Stage II water emergency when a water shortage exists such that immediate voluntary reductions in consumption are necessary. The public works department shall conduct an intensified public information campaign and shall coordinate the campaign to encourage voluntary water conservation through news releases and other methods of providing information about conservation methods.
C. Stage III – Critical Water Shortage – Limited Outdoor Restrictions. The mayor may declare a Stage III water emergency when a water shortage exists such that water supplies are critically impacted and water demand must be reduced. The mayor is authorized to establish certain specified days or hours for irrigating, sprinkling or watering lawns and gardens, and may prohibit or regulate other nonessential uses of water within the water system during such times as there is an actual or impending water shortage, extreme pressure loss in the distribution system, or for any other reasonable cause. The following nonessential uses of water may be prohibited on all properties connected to the city’s water system, whether inside or outside of the city:
    1. Washing sidewalks, walkways, driveways, parking lots, patios, and other exterior paved areas by direct hosing, except as may be necessary to prevent or eliminate materials dangerous to the public health and safety.
    2. Escape of water through breaks or leaks within the customer’s plumbing or private distribution system for any period of time beyond which such break or leak should reasonably have been discovered and corrected. It shall be presumed that a period of 48 hours after the customer discovers a leak or break, or receives notice from the city of such leak or break, whichever occurs first, is a reasonable time in which to correct the same.
    3. Noncommercial washing of privately owned motor vehicles, trailers, and boats, except from a bucket or hose using a shutoff nozzle for quick rinses.
    4. Lawn sprinkling and irrigation which allows water to run off or overspray the lawn area. Every customer is deemed to have knowledge of and control over his or her lawn sprinkling and irrigation at all times.
    5. Sprinkling and irrigation of lawns, ground cover, or other plants, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. or on any day not authorized by the established rotation schedule.
    6. Such other uses as the mayor deems appropriate.
D. Stage IV – Emergency Water Shortage – Mandatory Outdoor Restrictions and Indoor Conservation. The mayor may declare a Stage IV water emergency when a water shortage exists such that maximum flow reduction is immediately required, water available to the city is insufficient to permit any irrigation, watering, or sprinkling, and all available water is needed solely for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection. The mayor may prohibit all nonessential uses of water, including but not limited to all vehicle washing, all lawn watering, and all of the uses that may be prohibited for a Stage III water emergency. The public works and utilities department shall disseminate information using every available means to encourage customers to reduce indoor water usage to the maximum extent possible.
E. Stage V – Regional Disaster – Water Rationing. The mayor may declare a Stage V regional disaster water emergency when a water shortage exists such that water rationing must be implemented and emergency water distribution may be necessary for customers without water. The mayor is authorized to restrict water use by rationing the amount of water used by residential users to a certain number of gallons per day per person residing within the dwelling unit, by rationing the amount of water used by nonresidential users based on a percentage of their historical usage as calculated by the city, and by any other type of rationing as the mayor deems necessary and appropriate in the circumstances.
F. Implementation Requirements. Prior to the implementation and enforcement of any of the above stages, the mayor shall take reasonable efforts to have information disseminated to affected customers regarding the rationing plan, which shall include, at a minimum, publication in the official newspaper of the city at least once, not less than one week in advance of the effective date of the declaration, information of the declaration of the applicable stage, a description of the limitations and restrictions that would apply, and identification of the effective date of the declared stage and limitations and restrictions. Notwithstanding the publication requirements set forth herein above, if it is determined by the mayor that exigent circumstances exist that necessitate immediate implementation and enforcement of any particular stages of water emergency, notice to affected customers may be provided by personal service of the notice on said customers, or by posting notices at the customers’ residences (if the customers’ residences are the affected sites), or by posting notices at the locations where the customers’ utility services are received (if the affected sites are not their residences).
G. Term of Stage and Scope. The mayor is also authorized to determine the geographic area to which the declared stage shall apply, and to determine the duration for which the declared stage and its limitations and restrictions shall be in effect. (Ord. 5787 § 1, 2003.)

13.14.040 Enforcement.
The public works director or designee, code enforcement officers of the building division of the planning department or of the fire department, or police officers of the city shall have the authority to enforce the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 5787 § 1, 2003.)

13.14.050 Variances.
The public works director may grant temporary variances for the prospective use of water otherwise prohibited by this chapter. Such temporary variances shall be in writing and shall be based on a determination by the director that, due to unusual circumstances, application of this chapter would cause an extraordinary hardship adversely affecting the health, sanitation, or fire protection of the applicant or the public. The director’s determination shall be final unless appealed as follows: a party adversely affected by the director’s determination may appeal the determination to the mayor or designee within 24 hours of the director’s determination or such later time as the mayor may designate. The mayor’s determination shall be final and nonappealable. Said 24-hour periods shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. (Ord. 5787 § 1, 2003.)

A service contractor qualified to perform cleaning is required for cleaning and removing of the particles that have settled out of the service line. All material removed shall be disposed of in accordance with all city, county, state, and federal regulations. (Ord. 5934 § 5, 2005; Ord. 5852 § 1, 2004.)

13.20.160 Preliminary waste treatment – Required.
The standards and policies of the King County wastewater treatment division shall determine the need and extent for pretreatment. The city may choose to invoke any of these standards or policies on its own initiative as appropriate to protect the city sewer system from undue damage. (Ord. 5852 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5302 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. I), 1999; Ord. 4241 § 2, 1987.)

13.20.180 Industrial waste arrangements.
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted to the system by the city, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. (Ord. 5852 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. I), 1999; Ord. 4241 § 2, 1987.)

13.20.182 Property owner responsible for damages.
If the city determines that the actions of a property owner, or discharges from a private side sewer, result in damage to or partial or complete blockage within the public right-of-way or of a city-owned public sewer, or if such action or discharge requires corrective action by the city as determined by the city engineer, the property owner will be liable for said damage, blockage, and/or maintenance and will be financially responsible for any and all necessary repairs or other corrective actions necessary to restore the public sewer system to full and normal operation. (Ord. 6704 § 7 (Exh. G), 2018; Ord. 5852 § 1, 2004.)

13.20.184 Deduct meters.
Commercial and industrial sites that use water in a fashion that prevents it from entering the sanitary sewer system may request a permit from the city that will allow them to install a city deduct meter on their private on-site water line to measure the amount of water that is not being discharged to the sanitary sewer system. These meters shall be located in areas approved by the city. The establishment of a deduct meter requires the following:
A. Written authorization filed with the city allowing the city to own, operate and maintain said deduct meter, together with the ability to verify site conditions for permitting the use of a deduct meter.
B. City approval of location for the installation of deduct meter.
C. Written explanation of where water passing through the deduct meter goes and how the water is used.
D. A site can have only one deduct meter per domestic water meter unless approved by the city.
Deduct meters shall be owned, operated, and maintained by the city, placed upon private property within a utility easement, and may not be used for irrigation purposes. If the above requirements are not met, or the deduct meter is being used in a manner that has not been approved by the city, then the sewer bill shall be calculated based on total water volume utilized as measured by the water meter. (Ord. 5852 § 1, 2004.)

13.20.186 Sewer meters.
Sanitary sewer meters monitor, measure, record and totalize the flow of wastewater into the sanitary sewer system. This information is then used to generate a sewage bill for the site. Installation of sanitary sewer meters is discouraged by the city; however, the city engineer may determine that a sewer meter is the only appropriate device that will allow for the accurate measurement of waste water being sent into the public sewer system. Sites where a sewer meter may be allowed or required include, but are not limited to, facilities where the water source is not metered or facilities where industrial processes remove a significant amount of metered water from the waste stream. If allowed or required, then the meter shall be installed and operated pursuant to the following conditions:
A. Sewer meters shall be owned, operated and maintained by the property owner.
B. Sewer meters shall be selected and installed consistent with city of Auburn design standards.
C. Sewer meters shall continually totalize the flow passing through the meter and display the meter reading in ccf (one ccf equals 100 cubic feet).
D. The owner shall provide the city access to read the sewer meter, Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
E. A side sewer repair permit shall be obtained for the installation, replacement, or modification of sewer meters.
F. The property owner shall have the sewer meter calibrated once per calendar year by the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s authorized representative at the owner’s expense. A copy of the calibration report shall be furnished to the city public works department on or before December 31st of that year.
G. Regardless of whether the city has previously allowed or required the installation and use of a sewer meter, the city shall, after giving the property owner 30 working days’ notice and opportunity to cure the defect, bill the property owner for sewage based on metered water usage for the property for any of the following reasons:
    1. The owner fails to submit a calibration report.
    2. The calibration report indicates that the meter cannot be calibrated, and will not accurately measure flow.
    3. The city becomes aware that the meter is malfunctioning, or unexplained anomalies in the meter readings are identified.
If the source of the wastewater is not metered potable water (e.g., contaminated groundwater), the city may, after providing 15 working days’ notice of its intent to do so, elect to use previous years’ and/or months’ readings as a basis for sewer charges. The city shall add an additional 50 percent surcharge until such time as the owner provides a fully functional calibrated meter.
H. If a meter is found to be inoperative or inaccurate, the property owner must repair or replace the defective meter within 30 days of being notified of the problem.
If the property owner fails to comply with these conditions, the city may charge the owner for all expenses incurred in restoring compliance including, but not limited to, staff time, legal expenses, consultant costs, and the cost of repairs and equipment calibration. In cases where the city acts unilaterally to obtain compliance, a monthly surcharge of 10 percent will be added to the bill until such time as the finance director determines is necessary. The city may revoke the right to use a sewage meter at any time and the sewer bill shall be calculated based on total water volume utilized as measured by the water meter. At the finance director’s discretion, in cases of continued noncompliance, the city may also revoke the right to discharge to the sewer system. (Ord. 6331 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5852 § 1, 2004.)

13.20.444 Nonlienable property class of utility customers.
A. There is hereby created a class of utility customers where the customers receiving sewer utility services are receiving such services at property for which the city does not have the right to lien the property for nonpayment of utility services. The utility rates for such customers shall be as set forth in ACC 13.20.440; provided, that the city can also collect a utility services deposit as described as follows:
    1. The dollar amount of four months of the current city sewer rate and King County wastewater treatment rate based upon the level of service. Non-single-family services will base deposit on the base rate plus flow rates. Estimated flow rate will be calculated from the estimated measure of ccf’s used to calculate the water portion of the deposit; and
    2. The sum of the current rate for three late fees per city code, and one shut off fee and one meter removal fee if applicable.
B. For the purposes hereof, “nonlienable property” means property which is owned or held by a governmental or nongovernmental entity in such a way that it is immune from utility lien collection efforts of the city.
C. This new class of utility customers shall include new customers – new applications for utility services on nonlienable property and existing and former customers of utility services on nonlienable property whose utility services have been terminated for nonpayment or whose accounts have been referred to collection or to other utility payment enforcement services or personnel for nonpayment of utility services. (Ord. 6439 § 10, 2012.)

13.20.446 Waiver of deposit for nonlienable property class of utility customers – Appeal.
A. In connection with the utility services deposit for the nonlienable property class of utility customers as described in ACC 13.20.444, the finance director is authorized to grant a full or partial waiver to said utility customer from the deposit requirement where special humanitarian or health circumstances exist with respect to said utility customer’s receipt of utility services. The finance director shall have the sole discretion to grant such waivers, and determine if they shall be full or partial waivers, where such circumstances are found by the finance director to exist. If the waiver is granted, no deposit or only a reduced deposit shall be required.
B. If any person or entity has applied for a waiver of the deposit requirement and has been denied the requested waiver, such person or entity may appeal the decision denying the requested waiver by filing with the city clerk a notice of appeal, which notice of appeal must be received by the city clerk within 30 days of the decision denying the requested waiver. The appeal shall be based solely on whether special humanitarian or health circumstances exist with respect to the utility customer’s receipt of utility services, and shall be heard by a panel of department directors of the city (excluding the finance director) appointed by the mayor. The decision of the panel of department directors shall be final, and no further appeals shall be allowed.

13.22.090    Access for inspections.

13.22.010 Definitions.
Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise, the definitions set forth in ACC 13.20.010 shall apply to this chapter. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.020 FOG pretreatment and FOG plan required – When.
A. Businesses such as restaurants, cafes, lunch counters, cafeterias, bars, clubs, hotels, hospitals, factories, school kitchens, or other establishments that serve or prepare food where FOG may be part of the waste stream shall have grease traps, grease interceptors, or other approved pretreatment facilities in place to prevent the discharge of FOG to the sewer system.
B. Such businesses shall have an approved and implemented FOG control plan, and a business license for the business shall not be renewed or issued without an approved plan being on file with the city. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.030 FOG plan requirements.
All FOG plans shall include the following:
A. A description of the facility type and a summary of products made and/or service provided.
B. A description of any food processing that occurs on site, including but not limited to the type of food service (sit down or take out), types of cooking (saute, deep fry, etc.), a description of the menu, and a list of kitchen fixtures with potential to contribute FOG to the sanitary sewer.
C. Schematics of process areas illustrating drains and discharge points connected to the sewer.
D. A description of current reduction, recycling, treatment activities, and best management practices.
E. Specific performance goals and implementation schedule including cleaning frequency. Include cleaning and waste disposal procedures if business will self-clean grease trap. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.040 Installation requirements.
A. All FOG pretreatment facilities shall be installed, maintained, and operated by the business owner at his or her own expense. The pretreatment facility shall be adequately sized and located in a manner that provides ready and easy accessibility for cleaning and inspection at all times.
B. The grease interceptors must meet, at a minimum, the specifications of the current Uniform Plumbing Code and International Building Code adopted by the city at the time of construction. No food waste disposal shall be connected to or discharged into any grease trap or interceptor. No toilets shall discharge into an interceptor.
C. Increased volume of discharge (increased business) can become a factor, regarding the efficiency of the grease trap(s). As discharge volumes increase, the need for a larger grease trap(s) or an exterior grease interceptor may be necessary. If the facility’s waste stream discharge is not maintained within city standards, a pretreatment system upgrade will be required at the discharger’s expense. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.050 Effluent testing.
The city of Auburn may require periodic testing of effluent by businesses when the city has a reasonable belief that the business is not meeting the FOG discharge standards set forth in ACC 13.20.140 based on:
A. Downstream testing; or
B. Evidence of FOG buildup downstream; or
C. Discharger records that are incomplete, false, or not made available for inspection; or
D. Evidence of tampering with pretreatment equipment; or
E. Evidence of use by the business of degreasers, “enzymes” or other chemicals which keep grease in suspension past the grease trap or interceptor; or
F. Other reasons established by facts which warrant a belief that the discharge standards are violated. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.060 Recordkeeping.
Records and certification of maintenance, including copies of grease interceptor cleaning invoices, shall be made readily available to the city for review and inspection, and must be maintained by the business for a minimum of two years, or longer upon notification by the city. Copies of all maintenance and cleaning reports shall be sent in to the city within 10 days of service. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.070 Grease traps and grease interceptors – Cleaning and maintenance.
A. The grease trap or grease interceptor shall be kept in continuous operation at all times and shall be maintained to provide efficient operation. Businesses shall not allow the addition of emulsifying agents for the purposes of emulsifying polar or nonsolid FOG. Interceptor cleaning shall be done only by a service contractor qualified to perform such cleaning. All material removed shall be disposed of in accordance with all city, county, state, and federal regulations.
B. Grease Interceptor Cleaning. 
    1. Grease interceptor maintenance shall include quarterly (four times annually) pumping and cleaning of the interceptor, which shall be set forth in the FOG plan. The business may request to modify the quarterly cleaning frequency, by demonstrating that all solids and grease layers reported over the previous 12 months were less than 15 percent of the interceptor’s capacity. The city reserves the right at any time to modify the FOG plan to increase the cleaning frequency, if the grease interceptor’s solids and grease layer exceed 25 percent of its capacity at any time in the previous 12 months.
    2. Grease interceptor maintenance shall include removal of all FOG, solids and water from the grease interceptor. Skimming the surface layer of waste material, partial cleaning of the interceptor or use of any method that does not remove entire contents of the collection device does not constitute maintenance under this chapter. After a complete evacuation, the walls, top and bottom of the interceptor shall then be thoroughly scraped and the residue removed. The grease interceptor shall be filled with clean water before returning to service.
C. Grease Trap Cleaning. 
    1. Grease trap maintenance shall occur at the intervals set forth in the FOG plan, which shall not exceed 90 days. Grease trap maintenance shall include removal of the grease layer, scraping of baffles and removal of the sediment layer. The grease trap shall be filled with clean water before returning to service. A cleaning company, licensed to do business in the city of Auburn, may be employed to pump out the trap.
    2. Self-Cleaning. A business may be allowed under its FOG plan to self-clear its grease trap(s) located inside a building provided:
        a. The grease trap is no more than 55 gallons in liquid/operating capacity.
        b. Whenever the grease trap is inspected or cleaned, seams and pipes are checked for leaks, and the baffles and flow-regulating devices checked for effective operation.
        c. All FOG and food waste (including caked-on FOG and waste) is removed from the grease trap and its baffles.
        d. Oil and grease are skimmed from the surface of the water and placed in a watertight container.
        e. Solids are removed from the bottom of the grease trap and placed in a watertight container.
        f. The grease trap is filled with clean water before returning to service.
        g. The business records the date of cleaning and the amount of material removed from the grease trap in a maintenance log, and reports the information to the city under the terms of the FOG plan.
        h. All grease trap waste is placed in a leak-proof, sealable container(s) located on the premises, and shall be disposed of by either:
            i. Contracting with a licensed cleaning company to pick up the collected waste; or
            ii. Absorbing all free liquid with a dry absorbent and dispose as solid waste in a watertight container.
D. It is a violation of this chapter to discharge any waste, including FOG and solid material, removed from the grease trap to any drainage piping connected to the sanitary sewer or the storm drainage system. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.080 Oil/water separators required.
Businesses that operate automobile and truck repair facilities, steam cleaning facilities for motorized equipment, car sales lots, filling stations or any other establishment where petroleum-based grease and oil may be introduced to the sewer system shall have pretreatment facilities to prevent the discharge of oil and grease. These pretreatment facilities must be oil/water separators or interceptors located to collect such mixtures of grease, oil and water. Pretreatment facilities shall be in accordance with city and Washington State Department of Ecology standards. Businesses shall maintain, inspect and clean oil/water separators on a schedule that provides for effective operation.
Oil/water separators shall be inspected monthly or more frequently, as needed, by the owner. API oil/water separators shall be cleaned before the oil layer reaches three inches in depth. Coalescing plate separators shall be cleaned before the plates are coated with silt and/or solids. Cleaning shall include removal of all oil, water, and sediment, and refilling the separator with clean water. Cleaning shall be performed by a qualified service contractor. All material removed shall be disposed of in accordance with all federal, state, and/or local laws. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

13.22.090 Access for inspections.
The provisions of ACC 13.20.500, Access for inspections, shall apply to inspections conducted under this chapter. (Ord. 6152 § 5, 2008.)

B. An applicant whose request has been denied may appeal the denial following the procedure as identified in ACC 12.64A.060, Appeal and enforcement. (Ord. 6520 § 2, 2014; Ord. 6238 § 2, 2009.)

13.32A.130 City project process and requirements.
A. City Responsibilities. When service from underground electric and telecommunication utility facilities becomes available in all or part of a conversion area, the city engineer will issue a directive to the owners of all structures or improvements with service connections to the existing or temporary overhead utility facilities in the area by means of mailing a certified notice stating that service from the underground utility facilities is available and notifying the property owners of the owners’ responsibilities.
B. Property Owner’s Responsibilities. To facilitate completion of the city’s project, all electric and telecommunication service connections from the existing aerial utility facilities within the area to any structure or improvement must be decommissioned, disconnected and removed within 90 calendar days after the date of mailing. After existing aerial utility facilities identified by the city’s notice in subsection A of this section have been decommissioned, disconnected, and removed, the property owner must:
    1. Convert the service connections from the aerial system to the underground system within 90 calendar days after the date of receipt of the notice or the city will order the electric and telecommunication utilities to disconnect and remove the service connections. If the owner has filed written objections to such disconnection and removal with the city clerk within 30 calendar days after the date of mailing, the city will not order disconnection and removal until after the appeal hearing on those objections; or
    2. Notify the city engineer in writing within 30 calendar days after the date of receipt of the notice provided under subsection A of this section that the property owner wants to discontinue utility service; or
    3. If the city engineer determines it is in the best interest of the public and the city’s infrastructure system for the city to complete the service connection from the underground system to the existing aerial service point of connection and the property owner desires the city to do so, the property owner will enter into an agreement with the city within 90 calendar days after the date of mailing to provide property access to complete the conversion.
C. Financial Responsibilities. 
    1. For city projects, the cost of relocating existing utility aerial distribution facilities will be borne by the serving utility and the city in accordance with the filed tariffs or franchise agreement. If there is no filed tariff or franchise agreement, the cost of the relocation of existing aerial distribution facilities will be borne by the serving utility.
    2. For city projects, the undergrounding of the service connections for real property served by the aerial electric or telecommunication utility facilities that are being relocated underground will be at the owner(s)’s expense, including:
        a. Decommission, disconnect, and remove the service connections from those utility facilities to any structures or improvements located on the property.
        b. Either install underground service connections to those structures/improvements on the property or, on approval of the city engineer, discontinue utility service to one or more of the structures/improvements on the property.
    Services that are being connected by the city per subsection (B)(3) of this section are exempted from this requirement and the city will be financially responsible for those connection costs.
    3. All conversion of utility facilities to underground facilities may be undertaken by local improvement district or as otherwise permitted by law and as further authorized by RCW 35.96.030 and 35.96.040.
D. Appeal Procedures. 
    1. A property owner may appeal to the public works director the disconnection and removal of an aerial service connection by filing a written objection with the city clerk within 20 working days after the date of the mailing of the notice set forth in subsection A of this section. Failure to file a timely written objection will constitute a waiver of the owner’s right to object to such disconnection and removal. The public works director will have 15 working days to review the appeal, decide whether to uphold or modify the city engineer’s decision, and notify the property owner of such decision.
    2. All appeals of the public works director’s decision must be filed in writing with the public works director within 10 working days of the public works director’s decision. Appeals must specify the error of law or fact, or new evidence which could not have been reasonably available at the time of the public works director’s decision, which shall constitute the basis of the complaint.
    3. Appeals will be heard by the city’s hearing examiner pursuant to Chapter 2.46 ACC. Decisions of the hearing examiner will be based on whether the decision being appealed was consistent with applicable state law and city codes.
    4. Upon receipt of a timely written appeal, the hearing examiner will review the materials submitted and prepare findings of fact. The hearing examiner decision will be final. (Ord. 6713 § 1 (Exh. A), 2019; Ord. 6442 § 8, 2012; Ord. 6238 § 2, 2009.)

13.32A.140 Local improvement regulations apply.
Unless otherwise provided for in RCW 35.96.010 et seq., all the general provisions related to local improvements of cities and towns shall likewise apply to local improvements for the conversion of aerial electric and telecommunication facilities to underground facilities within the city limits. (Ord. 6238 § 2, 2009.)

A franchisee shall have in place procedures for utilization of other manpower and/or recording devices for handling the flow of telephone calls at peak periods of large outages or other major causes of subscriber concern. A copy of such procedures and/or policies shall be made available to the city.
B. In order that the city may be informed of a franchisee’s success in achieving satisfactory customer relations in its telephone answering functions, a franchisee shall, upon request by the city, and routinely no less than quarterly, provide the city with a summary that will provide, at a minimum, the following:

The franchisee shall make improvements in the appropriate categories which were found deficient pursuant to ACC 13.36.190 and 13.36.200 from the last reporting period. Failure to do so may result in the calling of a public hearing by the council for the purpose of examining the reasons, if any, why such improvements were not achieved by a franchisee.
B. An unsatisfactory record will result in the hearings being made part of an exhibit under Sections 626(c)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act alleging that such practices have failed to conform with future refranchising requirements as stated therein. In addition, a franchisee’s corporate office shall be advised of the city’s findings. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

B. During an evaluation session, a franchisee shall fully cooperate with the city and shall provide without cost such reasonable information and documents as the city may request to perform evaluations.
C. If the city has concerns because of uncorrected and reoccurring problems with the franchisee’s cable system, the city may retain an independent consultant to conduct an analysis of the cable system and its performance and submit a report of such analysis to the city. The city shall take into consideration any efforts taken to correct such deficiencies.

The results of initial such surveys will be appended to the respective franchise agreements. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.290 Nondiscrimination.
A. A franchisee shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules, regulations or in any other respect, make or grant any preferences or advantage to any person nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage; provided, that nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any customer coming within such classification would be entitled; and, provided further, that connection and/or service charges may be waived or modified during promotional campaigns of a franchisee.

B. In the event a franchisee fails to operate a system for 72 continuous and consecutive hours without prior notification to and approval of the city council or without just cause such as an impossibility to operate the system because of the occurrence of an act of God or other circumstances reasonably beyond a franchisee’s control, the city may, after notice and an opportunity for a franchisee to commence operations at its option, operate the system or designate someone to operate the system until such time as a franchisee restores service to conditions acceptable to the city council or a replacement franchisee is selected. If the city is required to fulfill this obligation for a franchisee, a franchisee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the system received by the city that are the result of a franchisee’s failure to perform. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

(Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.320 Transfer of ownership.
A. A franchisee’s right, title, or interest in the franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered, other than to an affiliate, without the prior consent of the city, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required, however, for a transfer in trust, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the franchisee in the franchise or cable system in order to secure indebtedness. Approval shall not be required for mortgaging purposes provided that the collateral does not specifically affect the assets of this franchise, or if the transfer is from a franchisee to another person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a franchisee.
B. In any transfer of a franchise requiring city approval, the applicant must show technical ability, financial capability, legal and general qualifications as determined by the city, and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. All costs associated with the transfer process shall be reimbursed to the city.
C. An assignment of a franchise shall be deemed to occur if there is an actual change in control or where ownership of 50 percent or more of the beneficial interests, singly or collectively, are obtained by other parties. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to majority stock ownership only, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.
D. Regardless of the circumstances, a franchisee shall promptly notify the city prior to any proposed change, transfer, or acquisition by any other party of a franchisee’s company. In the event that the city adopts a resolution denying its consent and such change, transfer or acquisition of control has been effected, the city may cancel the franchise. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.330 Removal and abandonment – Franchisee property.
A. The city may direct a franchisee to temporarily disconnect or bypass any equipment of a franchisee in order to complete street construction or modification, install and remove underground utilities, or for other reasons of public safety and efficient operation of the city. Such removal, relocation or other requirement shall be at the sole expense of a franchisee.
B. In the event that the use of any part of the cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event such system or property has been installed in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of the franchise or other city ordinances or the franchise has been terminated, cancelled or has expired, a franchisee shall promptly, upon being given 10 days’ notice, remove within 90 days from the streets or public places all such property and poles of such system other than any which the city may permit to be abandoned in place. In the event of such removal, a franchisee shall promptly restore the street or other areas in accordance with local regulations and standards from which such property has been removed to a condition similar to that existing before such removal and satisfactory to the city. Such approval shall not be unduly withheld.
C. Any property of a franchisee remaining in place 90 days after the termination or expiration of the franchise shall be considered permanently abandoned. The city may extend such time not to exceed an additional 90 days.
D. Any property of a franchisee to be abandoned in place shall be abandoned in such manner as the city shall prescribe. Upon permanent abandonment of the property of a franchisee in place, the property shall become that of the city, and a franchisee shall submit to the city clerk an instrument in writing, to be approved by the city attorney, transferring to the city the ownership of such property. None of the foregoing affects or limits franchisee’s rights to compensation for an involuntary abandonment of its property under state or federal law. In the event the city and a franchisee are unable to agree as to whether an abandonment is voluntary for the purposes of this section, either party may invoke arbitration to resolve such question. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.340 Termination – Revocation for cause.
A. If a franchisee willfully violates or fails to comply with any of the material provisions of a franchise, the city shall give written notice to a franchisee of the alleged noncompliance of its franchise. A franchisee shall have 45 days from the date of notice of noncompliance to cure such alleged default or, if such default cannot be cured within 45 days, to present to the city a plan of action whereby such default can be promptly cured.
B. If such default continues beyond the applicable dates agreed to for such cure, the city shall give a franchisee written notice that all rights conferred under this chapter and pursuant to its franchise may be revoked or terminated by the council after a public hearing. A franchisee shall be entitled to not less than 30 days’ prior notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing. The city may elect, in lieu of the above and without any prejudice to any of its other legal rights and remedies, to obtain an order from the superior court having jurisdiction compelling a franchisee to comply with the provisions of the franchise and recover damages and costs incurred by the city by reason of a franchisee’s failure to comply. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.350 Effect of termination for noncompliance.
Subject to state and federal law, if any franchise is terminated by the city by reason of a franchisee’s noncompliance, that part of the system under such franchise located in the streets and public property, shall, at the election of the city, become the property of the city at a cost consistent with the provisions of Section 627(b)(1) of the Act. If the city, or a third party, does not purchase the system, a franchisee shall, upon order of the city council, remove the system as required under ACC 13.36.330. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

In any case in which suit or action is instituted against the city by reason of damage or injury caused by a franchisee, the city shall cause written notice thereof to be given to a franchisee and a franchisee thereupon shall have the duty to appear and defend any such suit or action, without cost or expense to the city. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

B. The policies mentioned in the foregoing paragraph shall name the city as additional insured and shall contain a provision that a written notice of cancellation or reduction in coverage of said policy shall be delivered to the city 30 days in advance of the effective date thereof. If such insurance is provided by a policy which also covers a franchisee or any other entity or person other than those above named, then such policy shall contain the standard cross-liability endorsement. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.380 Performance bond.
A franchisee shall promptly repair or cause to be repaired any damage to city property caused by a franchisee or any agent of a franchisee.

A franchisee shall pay to the city upon acceptance of any franchise granted hereunder the city’s out-of-pocket costs associated with the franchising process. The city shall provide the franchisee an itemization of its anticipated costs. Such payment is in addition to franchise fee payments. Payment is due within 30 days of receipt of appropriate invoice from the city. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

13.36.400 Equalization of civic contributions.
A. In the event of one or more franchises being granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the city may require that such subsequential franchisees pay to the city an amount proportionally equal to franchising costs contributed by the initial franchisee. These costs may include, but are not limited to, such features as access and institutional network costs, bi-directional or equivalent cable installed to municipal buildings and similar expenses.
B. On the anniversary of the grant of each later awarded franchise, such franchisees shall pay to the city an amount proportional to the amount contributed by the original franchisee, based upon the amount of subscribers held by such franchisees.
C. Additional franchisees shall provide all PEG access channel(s) and the emergency override system currently available to the subscribers of existing franchisees. In order to provide these access channels, additional franchisees may interconnect, at their cost, with existing franchisees, subject to any reasonable terms and conditions that the existing franchisee providing the interconnection may require. These interconnection agreements shall be made directly between the franchisees. The city council, in such cases of dispute of award, may be called upon to arbitrate regarding these arrangements. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

If any portion of chapter should be inconsistent or conflict with any rule or regulation now or hereafter adopted by the FCC or other federal law, then to the extent of the inconsistency or conflict, the rule or regulation of the FCC or other federal law shall control for so long, but only for so long, as such rule, regulation, or law shall remain in effect; provided the remaining provisions of this chapter shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 4625 § 2, 1993.)

(Ord. 6617 § 6, 2016; Ord. 6391 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6341 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6283 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5801 § 1, 2003; Ord. 4830 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4479 § 2, 1990; Ord. 3510 § 2, 1980.)

13.41.020 Purpose.
The city council has determined that it is reasonable and in the public interest to enact and impose a utility systems development charge for the purpose of recovering a fair share of the costs of providing existing utility system infrastructure to serve new customers or revised uses of existing customers. The intent is to reimburse the city’s utility for the cost of construction of available capacity sanitary sewer, water and storm drainage facilities from those properties, which as part of their development and use create direct or indirect needs for those facilities. The city council finds that the public would benefit from a logical long-range approach to the financing of necessary general facilities. Experience has demonstrated that the lack of such provision casts an unfair and unexpected burden on taxpayers and residences in the form of utility rates, taxes, bond interest costs and assessments when core, general or central facilities become inadequate, causing a crisis. Operating from crisis to crisis is wasteful, unsafe and not an acceptable method of operating local government; and debt financing should be minimized wherever possible. (Ord. 6455 § 1, 2013; Ord. 6391 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6341 § 1, 2011; Ord. 5801 § 1, 2003; Ord. 4830 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4479 § 2, 1990; Ord. 3510 § 1, 1980.)

13.41.030 Utility systems development charge imposed – Rates – Review.
A. A sanitary sewer and water utility systems development charge is imposed upon all lands inside the boundary of the city, and all lands outside the boundary of the city which utilize either sanitary sewer facilities or water facilities or both of the city, and a storm drainage utility systems development charge is imposed upon all lands in the city, except those lands exempted under this chapter, which fees and charges shall be as set forth on the city of Auburn fee schedule.
B. The utility systems development charge as set forth in the city fee schedule will be computed to consider the future and/or current value of the utility system’s fixed assets, excluding contributions by developers, and outstanding bonded indebtedness, and will also consider an appropriate service unit.
C. The utility systems development charge imposed shall be reviewed annually by the city council and the charges may be revised to reflect changes in utility asset value, depreciation of the utility system fixed assets, bonded indebtedness, and the number of ERU, RCE or ESU customers served. (Ord. 6391 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6341 § 1, 2011; Ord. 5819 § 4, 2004; Ord. 5801 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5709 § 1, 2002; Ord. 5619 § 2, 2001; Ord. 5125 § 2, 1998; Ord. 4830 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4479 § 2, 1990; Ord. 3510 § 1, 1980.)

Article I. Establishment and Administration

13.48.005 Purpose.
The city has determined that a storm drainage utility and associated regulations are necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Auburn; promote sound development policies and construction procedures which respect and preserve the city’s natural resources; and prevent the creation of public nuisances that would occur without such utility and regulations. The purpose of the storm drainage utility is to:
A. Maintain the city’s compliance with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Western Washington Phase II Municipal Stormwater Permit;
B. Maintain the city’s compliance with federal flood insurance programs;
C. Require the integration of low impact development policies, procedures, and BMPs into the city’s storm water infrastructure where feasible;
D. Control and prevent the flooding of property, both public and private;
E. Manage uncontrolled volume increase, rate, or contaminated load of runoff;
F. Maintain and protect existing water resources such as creeks, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, groundwater, and other water bodies;
G. Maintain and protect water used for contact recreation, aquatic habitat, and aesthetic quality;
H. Provide for the planning, security, design, construction, use, maintenance, repair and inspection of the storm and surface water system;
I. Protect the functions and values of critical areas as required under the State’s Growth Management Act and Shoreline Management Act;
J. Provide for enforcement of the provisions of this code, the engineering construction standards and the engineering design standards per Chapter 12.04 ACC, and related city manuals and code provisions;
K. Establish rates and charges that provide a method of payment of all or any part of the cost and expense of maintaining and operating storm water control facilities; all or any part of the cost and expense of planning, designing, establishing, acquiring, developing, constructing and improving storm water control facilities; or all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such purpose. (Ord. 6617 § 8, 2016; Ord. 6251 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5853 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. J), 1999; Ord. 4776 § 1, 1995.)

One ESU is equal to 2,600 square feet of impervious surface area or any portion thereof.
J. “Hard surface” means an impervious surface, a permeable pavement, or a vegetated roof.
K. “Illicit connection” means any manmade conveyance that is connected to a municipal separate storm sewer without a permit, excluding roof drains and other similar type connections.

1An “equivalent service unit (ESU)” is defined in ACC 13.48.010 as 2,600 square feet of impervious surface.
The customer classes set forth in this subsection shall be applicable only if the qualifying on-site facilities have met applicable city standards upon installation, have received city approval of construction, and are in conformity with the applicable operations and maintenance standards. If the city determines that the operation and maintenance standards are not being complied with, the customer class shall be determined to be that of non-single-family only, until operation and maintenance of the facilities meet city standards. The customer being billed may apply in writing for a system inspection. If the inspection shows that the facilities meet city standards, the customer will be reclassified to the previous class.
B. Developed Parcels. Only developed parcels containing impervious surfaces as defined in ACC 13.48.010 shall be charged.
C. Multiple Class Accounts. When a developed non-single-family parcel contains more than one customer class, the appropriate rate for each customer class will be calculated, and the aggregate total summed for billing. (Ord. 6690 § 4 (Exh. C), 2018.)

13.48.110 Measurement of impervious area.
The city shall determine the number of square feet of impervious surface in all non-single-family parcels, excluding undeveloped parcels, and the total surface area of each such parcel of real property, using the amount of impervious surface provided by the applicant, the best available source data as obtained through the records of the appropriate county assessor for the county in which the parcel is sited, aerial photographic methods, or applicable engineering drawings. Within the limits of the source data, accuracy to two-tenths of an equivalent service unit will be made. Impervious surface created incidental to a lot line adjustment to separate an undeveloped parcel from a developed parcel and which results in impervious surface less than two-tenths of an equivalent service unit upon the undeveloped parcel shall not be subject to a storm drainage charge. (Ord. 6617 § 10, 2016; Ord. 5853 § 1, 2004; Ord. 5530 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5293 § 2, 1999; Ord. 5212 § 1 (Exh. J), 1999; Ord. 4492 § 4, 1991.)

A. Pursuant to the Western Washington Phase II Municipal Stormwater NPDES Permit issued by the Department of Ecology, the city has implemented a storm water management program that requires the use of City of Auburn Surface Water Management Manual, hereinafter referred to as the “SWMM.”
B. The following activities that discharge to the storm drains, either directly or indirectly, are regulated through the storm water management program under this chapter:
    1. Existing discharges and land uses that discharge to the storm drains, either directly or indirectly.
    2. New development and redevelopment.
    3. Storm water maintenance activities.
C. Requirements for Existing Discharges and Land Uses. If the city engineer determines that the discharges from an existing drainage control facility cause or contribute to an illicit discharge, a threat to public health and safety, or a violation of the city’s municipal storm water NPDES permit or this chapter, the city engineer shall require the responsible party to implement and maintain operational BMPs in accordance with Volume IV of the SWMM. If the city engineer determines that the discharges causing or contributing to the problem cannot be adequately addressed by operational BMPs, the city engineer may require the responsible party to undertake more stringent or additional BMPs, which may include structural BMPs or other actions necessary to cease causing or contributing to the problem or violation.
D. Minimum Requirements for New Development and Redevelopment. New development and redevelopment activities are required to obtain city permits and shall comply with the following minimum requirements, in accordance with the city’s municipal storm water NPDES permit and in accordance with the thresholds and requirements in the SWMM:
    1. Preparation of a Storm Water Site Plan. All projects shall prepare a storm water site plan for review and approval by the city engineer or his/her designee that identifies and describes how all storm water generated from a development activity will be managed on site. Stormwater site plans shall be designed in accordance with Volume I, Chapter 3 of the SWMM. Exception: Existing single-family and duplex lots are exempt from this requirement when all of the following criteria are met:
        a. The lot is located within a subdivision that was approved under storm water regulations in effect between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2016; and
        b. The lot can connect to an existing centralized storm water management system originally designed to collect storm water generated from the entire lot (e.g., house, driveway, patios, yard, etc.).
    2. Preparation of a Construction Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan for Erosion and Sediment Control. This plan shall be designed to comply with the requirements and purposes of the SWMM, this section, any other applicable sections of ACC Titles 15, 16, 17 and 18 and any departmental guidelines promulgated by the city engineer.

(Ord. 6617 § 12, 2016; Ord. 6283 § 6, 2009; Ord. 5853 § 1, 2004.)

13.48.226 Exceptions procedure.
A. Requests for deviation from the minimum requirements of ACC 13.48.225 may be made according to this section. A deviation may be requested to allow a modification, reduction or waiver of a requirement or to permit an alternative requirement. Any such request must be made in writing. Requests for a deviation must include the following information:
    1. The current (pre-project) use of the site;
    2. How application of the minimum requirement(s) restricts the proposed uses of the site compared to the restrictions that existed prior to the adoption of the minimum requirements;
    3. The possible remaining uses of the site if the deviation were not granted;
    4. The uses of the site that would have been allowed prior to the adoption of the minimum requirements;
    5. A comparison of the estimated amount and percentage of value loss as a result of the minimum requirements versus the estimated amount and percentage of value loss as a result of requirements that existed prior to the adoption of the minimum requirements; and
    6. The feasibility for the owner to alter the project to apply the minimum requirements.
The city engineer shall approve or deny such requests in writing and shall only approve a deviation to the extent it is necessary. An applicant is not entitled to a deviation, whether or not criteria for approval of a deviation are met. The city engineer may require the applicant to submit a Washington State licensed engineer’s report or analysis with a request for a deviation. As a condition of approving a deviation, the city engineer may impose new or additional requirements to offset or mitigate harm that may be caused by approving the deviation.
B. Equally Protective Deviations. The city engineer may approve a request for a deviation if determined that it is likely to be equally protective of public health, safety and welfare, the environment, and public and private property as the requirement from which a deviation is sought.
C. Other Deviations. The city engineer also may approve a request for a deviation where the criteria in subsection B of this section are not met or the city engineer cannot determine whether the criteria are met, if it is determined at his or her sole discretion that substantial reasons exist for approving the requested deviation and:
    1. The deviation will not increase risk to the public health and welfare;
    2. Will not be injurious to other properties in the vicinity and/or downstream;
    3. Will not degrade the quality of waters of the state; and
    4. The deviation is the least possible that could be granted to comply with the intent of the minimum requirements.
D. The approval of a deviation shall not be construed to be an approval of any violation of any other provisions of this chapter or approval of any violation of any other ordinance of the city nor approval of any violation of any other valid law of any governmental entity having jurisdiction. The approval of plans, specifications, and calculations for deviation shall not prevent the city engineer from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in such plans, specifications, or other data, or from preventing operations being carried out when in violation of this chapter, or any other ordinance of the city.
E. The following public notice requirements apply whenever a request for an exception to the minimum requirements contained in ACC 13.48.225 (request) is received by the city:
    1. Public notice (notice) shall be made to inform the public about the contents of the request and the city engineer’s decision to grant or deny it. Notice of the request and the decision to grant or deny the request may be combined.
    2. The notice shall be published, at the requester’s cost, in the city’s newspaper of record and a local newspaper of general circulation within Auburn.
    3. The notice shall include: (a) a brief description of the request; (b) a brief description of the city engineer’s decision to grant the request and reasons supporting the decision, or a statement that the request is denied; (c) where the request can be reviewed; and (d) the name and contact information of a city employee who can answer questions regarding the request.
    4. The city shall provide a hard copy of the city engineer’s decision to grant or deny a request to the requester.

13.52.010 Short title and purpose.
A. This chapter may be known and cited as the “third party billing regulation” chapter. The general purpose of this chapter is to prevent landlords, either themselves or through a third party billing agent, from billing tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility services without proper notice and disclosure of billing practices to tenants, and to protect tenants from deceptive or fraudulent billing practices, and to these ends the provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a landlord from including a tenant’s cost of master metered or other unmetered utility services within the rent set forth in a rental agreement, and the practice of including such cost within a tenant’s rent shall not be considered a billing practice or methodology affected by the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 6084 § 1, 2007.)

13.52.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following definitions apply:
A. “Billing entity” means the landlord or third party billing agent, as the case may be, responsible for billing residential multi-unit building tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility service.
B. “Disclosure” means providing tenants with complete and accurate written information in a clear, concise, and understandable manner in all notices required under this chapter and on each bill presented from the billing entity to tenants.
C. “Landlord” means a “landlord” as defined in and within the scope of RCW 59.18.030 and 59.18.040 of the Residential Landlord Tenant Act of 1973 (“RLTA”) in effect at the time the rental agreement is executed, and shall also mean the owner of a mobile home park. At the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, RLTA defined “landlord” as “the owner, lessor, or sublessor of the dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part,” and includes “any person designated as representative of the landlord,” including the operator of the residential facility and/or mobile home park, representing, working for and on behalf of the owner/landlord as defined herein.
D. “Master metered utility service” means a utility service supplied to more than one unit in a multi-unit building and measured through a single inclusive metering system.
E. “Methodology” refers to any method, technique, or criterion used to apportion to tenants’ charges billed to the landlord by the utility for master metered utility service or unmetered utility service, including but not limited to ratio utility billing systems, installation of submetering, and hot water metering.
F. “Multi-unit building” refers to a residential building or group of buildings (which may include a mobile home park) with three or more tenant units with a master metered utility service or unmetered utility service, such as solid waste collection, that is provided to the building or group of buildings as a whole.
G. “Personally identifiable information” means specific information about a tenant, including but not limited to the tenant’s Social Security number, birth date, mother’s maiden name, banking data or information, or any other personal or private information.
H. “Ratio utility billing system” or “RUBS” refers to any methodology by which the cost of master metered or other unmetered utility service provided to tenants and common areas of a multi-unit building is apportioned to tenants through the use of a formula that estimates the utility usage of each rental unit in the building based on the number of occupants in a unit, number of bedrooms in a unit, square footage of a unit, or any similar criterion.
I. “Rental agreement” means a “rental agreement” as defined in and within the scope of RCW 59.18.030 and 59.18.040 of the Residential Landlord Tenant Act (RLTA) in effect at the time the rental agreement is executed, and is deemed to include any month-to-month tenancy arrangement, whether written or oral. At the time of the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the RLTA defined “rental agreement” as “all agreements which establish or modify the terms, conditions, rules, regulations, or any other provisions concerning the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit.”
J. “Service charge” refers to any charge or fee imposed by the billing entity to cover the costs of providing or administering the billing practices, regardless of the label applied to such charge or fee.
K. “Tenant” means a “tenant” as defined in and within the scope of RCW 59.18.030 and 59.18.040 of the RLTA in effect at the time the rental agreement is executed, and shall also mean a tenant of a mobile home park. At the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the RLTA defined “tenant” as “any person who is entitled to occupy a dwelling unit primarily for living or dwelling purposes under a rental agreement.”
L. “Billing practices” refers to the practices of a landlord or third party billing agent, as defined herein, that bills residential multi-unit building tenants for the purpose of apportioning master metered or other unmetered utility services provided to the building(s) as a whole, either by directly submetering tenants’ usage or by otherwise apportioning such utility services among tenants, and also refers to any practices related thereto, including but not limited to collecting, using or disclosing tenants’ personally identifiable information (other than name and address), attempting to collect unpaid amounts from tenants, verifying tenants’ credit, and reporting unpaid balances to credit reporting agencies.
M. “Third party billing agent” refers to any entity retained or authorized by a landlord to bill tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility service on behalf of and as the agent of a landlord.
N. “Utilities” or “utility service(s)” refers to water, sewer, storm water, and solid waste services. (Ord. 6084 § 1, 2007.)

13.52.030 Prohibited billing practices.
A. It is a deceptive and fraudulent business practice for any landlord or third party billing agent to bill tenants separately for utility services except as permitted in this chapter.
B. It is a deceptive and fraudulent business practice for a landlord to engage, retain, or authorize a third party billing agent who does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, and a landlord shall be liable for the actions engaging, retaining, or authorizing a third party billing agent who does not comply with the requirements of this chapter.
C. As of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, no landlord may disclose to a third party billing agent a tenant’s personally identifiable information under any circumstances; provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall prevent a landlord from disclosing a tenant’s name and address to a third party billing agent for the purpose of engaging in permitted billing practices.
D. A third party billing agent who, prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, has obtained any tenant’s personally identifiable information (other than name and address) shall not use, sell, convey, or otherwise disclose that personally identifiable information to any other person, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, and must destroy all such information upon a tenant’s request, when the tenancy terminates and the account is paid, or when the landlord terminates the third party billing agency relationship.
E. No third party billing agent may inform a credit reporting agency of a claim against a tenant except as expressly permitted in Chapter 19.16 RCW, regardless of whether the third party billing agent is licensed by the state pursuant to that chapter. (Ord. 6084 § 1, 2007.)

13.52.040 Billing requirements.
A. A landlord may, itself or through a third party billing agent, bill tenants for master metered or other unmetered utility services, including electric service provided to tenants of multi-unit buildings; provided, that the following requirements are met:
    1. Notice. Billing practices may be adopted only upon advance written notice to a tenant as part of a new or renewed rental agreement. Tenants must receive such written notice at least 90 days before expiration of their rental agreements, or, in the case of month-to-month tenancies, at least 90 days before any such billing practices may become effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing two sentences, if billing practices are already in place at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective, written notice must be given within 30 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
    2. Methodology. The notice required under subsection (A)(1) of this section must include a copy of this chapter and a detailed written disclosure of the methodology used by the billing agent to allocate the charges to each tenant, including the methodology used to allocate utility services for common areas of the building, along with all other terms and conditions of the billing arrangement. If submetering is used, the notice required under subsection (A)(1) of this section shall also include descriptions of the location of the submeter and of the access requirements, if any, required by the landlord for access to tenant units for submeter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, or inspections, including removal of the submeter for testing, consistent with the provisions of RCW 59.18.150 of the RLTA. An additional written notice must also be given at least 30 days prior to the due date of the next rental payment in order to implement a change in billing agents, apportionment methodology, fees, or other terms and conditions of the billing arrangement.
    3. Posting of Information. 
        a. In addition to the written notification required by subsection (A)(2) of this section, any landlord employing billing practices shall post in a conspicuous public space in the interior of the building copies of the three most current utility bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services provided to the building as a whole that are included in the bill sent to the tenant, together with a written description of the methodology used to allocate each such utility service and a copy of this chapter. The landlord shall also post the provisions of this chapter in a conspicuous public space in the interior of the building.
        b. Where such postings are physically impracticable due to the absence of a suitable conspicuous public space, a landlord may satisfy the posting requirements by hand-delivering or mailing to each of the tenants a paper copy of the written notification required by subsection (A)(2) of this section, together with a written description of the methodology used to allocate each such utility service and a copy of the provisions of this chapter. In lieu of posting the three most current utility bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services provided to the building as a whole that are included in the bill sent to the tenant, the landlord must make such utility bills available upon request within five business days and must inform tenants in the written notification required by subsection (A)(2) of this section of the method by which they may request such utility bills.
        c. Landlords shall keep bills for master metered or other unmetered utility services on file in the building for at least two years and shall make such bills available to tenants for inspection and copying upon request. Where it is physically impracticable to keep such bills on file due to the absence of a suitable office or other storage space, a landlord may store the bills in another location and must make such bills available within five business days of receiving a request from a tenant.
    4. Limitations on Charges. The total of all charges for any utility service included in the bills sent to all units cumulatively shall not exceed the amount of the bill sent by the utility itself for the building as a whole, less any late charges, interest or other penalties owed by the landlord, with the exception of the following, which may be included in each bill covering an independent unit within the multi-unit building:
        a. A service charge of no more than $2.00 per utility per month, not to exceed a cumulative service charge of $5.00 per month for all the utilities included in any bill.
        b. Late payment charges of no more than $5.00 per month plus interest at a rate not to exceed one percent per month, which late payment charge shall not accrue until at least 30 days after the tenant receives the bill.
        c. Insufficient funds check charges for dishonored checks, not to exceed the amount established in the city’s fee schedule for dishonored checks presented to the city.
    5. Licensing of Third Party Billing Agents. Any third party billing agent must be properly registered and licensed to do business in the state of Washington and city of Auburn and must be in compliance with all applicable Washington State and Auburn laws and regulations, and all applicable Washington and Auburn license identification numbers, if any, must be disclosed upon request.
    6. Content of Bills. Each billing statement sent to a tenant by a billing entity must disclose all required information in a clear and conspicuous manner and at minimum must:
        a. Include the name, business address and telephone number of the billing entity;
        b. Identify and show the basis for each separate charge, including service charges and late charges, if any, as a line item, and show the total amount of the bill;
        c. If the building units are submetered, include the current and previous meter readings, the current read date, and the amount consumed (or estimated to have been consumed if Auburn has provided the landlord with an estimated bill);
        d. Specify the due date, the date upon which the bill becomes overdue, the amount of any late charges or penalties that may apply, and the date upon which such late charges or penalties may be imposed;
        e. Identify any past due dollar amounts;
        f. Identify a mailing address and telephone number for billing inquiries and disputes, identify the entity responsible for resolving billing inquiries and disputes and its business hours and days of availability, and describe the process used to resolve disputes related to bills as set forth in this chapter; and
        g. Include a statement to the effect that “this bill is from [landlord name] and not from Auburn Public Utilities.”
    7. Protection of Personally Identifiable Information. 
        a. A third party billing agent who, prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, has obtained a tenant’s personally identifiable information shall take such actions as are necessary to protect such personally identifiable information and to prevent its use or disclosure except as expressly permitted in this chapter.
        b. A third party billing agent who, prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, has obtained a tenant’s personally identifiable information may disclose such personally identifiable information only to the extent necessary to render its billing services.
        c. To the extent required by federal, state, or local law, a billing entity may disclose personally identifiable information in its possession (i) pursuant to a subpoena or valid court order authorizing such disclosure, or (ii) to a governmental entity.
    8. Estimated Billing. If Auburn has billed the landlord using an estimate of utility service consumed, the billing agent may estimate the charges to be billed to tenants until billing based on actual consumption resumes. Upon receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill overstated charges, the landlord must refund the difference to tenants. Upon receipt of a corrected bill showing that the estimated bill understated charges, the landlord may attempt to recover the underpayment from the tenants that actually incurred the charges during the billing period, but shall not attempt to recover an underpayment from a tenant who did not reside in the unit during the billing period in which the charges were incurred.
    9. Submetering. Submetering is permitted as a way of allocating master metered utility services to tenants provided the following conditions are met:
        a. The submeters must be read prior to each billing.
        b. A landlord may not enter a unit without, and a tenant may not unreasonably withhold, consent to enter the unit in order to perform sub-meter installation, reading, repair, maintenance, and inspection, including removal of the submeter for testing; provided, however, that a landlord may enter a unit without a tenant’s consent in the case of a submeter leak or emergency related to that unit’s submeter.
        c. If a tenant contests the accuracy of the submeter, the tenant shall have the option of demanding an independent test of the meter by a certified testing company. If the meter reads within a five percent range of accuracy, the tenant requesting the test shall pay the cost of the meter test. If the meter reads outside a five percent range of accuracy, the landlord shall pay for the cost of the meter test and within 30 days refund any overpayments for the past three months based on a recalculation of the past year’s billings by correcting for the inaccuracy of the submeter. Submetering thereafter shall only be permitted with a repaired submeter.
B. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a landlord from addressing billing of master metered or other unmetered utility services in a written addendum to a lease. A lease addendum may be used to give the notice required under subsection (A)(1) of this section, so long as the lease addendum is provided to the tenant with the notice required under that subsection, and so long as all other requirements of this chapter are satisfied. (Ord. 6706 § 3 (Exh. C), 2018; Ord. 6084 § 1, 2007.)

13.52.050 Dispute resolution and remedies.
A. A dispute regarding the amount of charges or other terms and conditions contained in a bill shall be resolved as follows:
    1. The tenant must notify the billing entity of the nature of and reason for the dispute by calling the number shown on the bill or by writing a letter to the billing entity within 30 days of receiving the bill. The tenant must have a good faith basis for any such dispute.
    2. Within 30 days of receiving notice of a billing dispute, the billing entity must contact the tenant to discuss the dispute, and the billing entity and tenant must determine the amount of disputed and undisputed charges. The tenant must pay all undisputed charges within 30 days of reaching agreement with the billing entity.
    3. No late fees or interest charges shall accrue on any disputed portions of a bill while the amount is being resolved in accordance with subsections (A)(1) and (2) of this section, and no collection activity related to the disputed portions of a bill may be instituted against a tenant that has notified the billing entity of a dispute in accordance with this chapter.
    4. The tenant and billing entity shall continue to discuss in good faith any remaining disputed amounts and attempt to reach an agreement on the amount due, if any, within 60 days of the billing entity’s receipt of notice of a billing dispute. If a tenant is unable to reach a satisfactory resolution of any portion of a disputed charge within the allotted time, the tenant may exercise any of the remedies set forth in subsection B of this section or any other available remedies; provided, however, that if within 120 days of the billing entity’s receipt of notice of a billing dispute, the tenant has not either exercised one of the remedies set forth in subsection B of this section or paid the remaining disputed amounts, the landlord may exercise any legal or equitable remedies available to it to collect the unpaid amounts; and provided further, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to deprive a landlord of its right to exercise any legal or equitable remedies available to it against a tenant that has not paid any undisputed charges, has not followed the procedures set forth in this section, or has not exercised good faith in disputing a charge.
B. If a tenant believes that it has been or will be subject to billing practices that violate any provision set forth in this chapter, including the failure to comply with the notice requirements of ACC 13.52.040(A)(3), the tenant may, at its option, file a complaint against the landlord with the hearing examiner or institute a civil action against the landlord, as follows:
    1. The hearing examiner is hereby vested with the authority to hear and resolve, in a timely manner, tenant complaints against landlords regarding billing practices in accordance with its rules and procedures then in force governing contested cases. The filing fee for such a case shall be set at $25.00. Upon the finding of a violation of this chapter, the hearing examiner shall award actual damages (including but not limited to refund of any overpayment or other fees or charges resulting from such violation, and costs of pursuing the claim) and a penalty of $100.00, and may permit the tenant to terminate the rental agreement by written notice in accordance with RCW 59.18.090. If the hearing examiner determines that the landlord engaged in prohibited billing practices in deliberate violation of this chapter, the penalty mentioned in the preceding sentence shall also award attorneys’ fees to the tenant. A final order or decision of the hearing examiner may be subject to judicial review in the King County superior court in accordance with the hearing examiner’s rules and procedures.
    2. In the alternative, a tenant may institute a civil action against the landlord. Upon a finding that the landlord engaged in billing practices that violate this chapter, the court shall award actual damages (including but not limited to refund of any overpayment of other fees or charges resulting from such violation, and cost of pursuing the claim) and a penalty of $100.00, and may permit the tenant to terminate the rental agreement by written notice in accordance with RCW 59.18.090.
    If the court determines that the landlord engaged in prohibited billing practices in deliberate violation of this chapter, the penalty mentioned in the preceding sentence shall be $200.00, and the court shall also award attorneys’ fees to the tenant.
    3. No late fees or interest charges shall accrue on any disputed portions of a bill while the amount is being resolved by the hearing examiner or court, and no collection activity or unlawful detainer action alleging default in the payment of rent related to the disputed portions of a bill may be instituted against a tenant that has filed a complaint with the hearing examiner or instituted a civil action in accordance with this chapter while the amount is being resolved by the hearing examiner or court. If the hearing examiner or court resolves the dispute and finds that a tenant that has not acted in good faith in asserting a billing dispute, the hearing examiner or court may order the tenant to pay late fees and/or interest charges on some or all of the disputed portions of the bill.
    4. A landlord shall not pass on, charge, or otherwise allocate to tenants, in any manner whatsoever, any damages, fine or penalty (including attorneys’ fees) that the landlord is ordered to pay under this chapter.
C. The existence of an unresolved or pending billing dispute does not relieve a tenant of the tenant’s obligation to pay in a timely fashion all undisputed charges, including those undisputed charges that accrue after the dispute resolution procedures of this chapter have been commenced.

14.01.010 Purpose and scope.
The purpose and scope of this title is to establish standard procedures for all project permit decisions made by the city of Auburn. The intent of the procedures is to combine the environmental review process, both procedural and substantive, with procedures for review of project permit decisions and, except for the appeal of a determination of significance as provided in RCW 43.21C.075, provide for consolidation of appeal processes for permit decisions. The goals are to allow for informed public participation, reduce redundancy in the application, permit review and appeal processes, thereby minimizing delays and expense, and implement the city’s goals as set forth in the comprehensive plan.
Any project permit application submitted on or after April 1, 1996, shall be processed as provided in this title. If any requirements contained in this newly created Title 14 are in conflict with provisions or requirements contained in other titles of the Auburn City Code, a request for interpretation regarding applicability may be submitted to the director of the department which has authority to administer the provision, code, regulation, plan, rule or manual. The department director will provide a written response within 10 working days after receipt of the request. (Ord. 4835 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.002 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that all development that occurs in unincorporated areas, that receives either water or sanitary sewer from the city of Auburn, is consistent with the development standards of the city of Auburn. In so doing the property at the time of annexation will be consistent with city development standards making it is less likely that the city will have to expend public funds to address a substandard development after annexation. An additional purpose is to ensure the property is obligated to annex to the city at the appropriate time as determined by the city. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999.)

14.18.004 Property adjacent to city limits.
If the property that is requesting water and/or sanitary sewer service is adjacent to the Auburn city limits, the subject property shall be annexed to the city prior to receiving water and/or sanitary sewer from the city. If it is determined by the city of Auburn that it would not be practical to immediately annex subject property due to constraints in providing adequate city services or for other reasons that would make the annexation impractical, at the present time, then a development agreement is required pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999.)

14.18.006 Definitions.
A. “Development” means any construction to include excavation, filling, grading, paving, new construction or expansion of a building, structure or use or any change in the use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of land.
B. “Development agreement” means an agreement between the city of Auburn and the property owner(s)/developer(s) of land located outside the incorporated boundaries of the city of Auburn. The development agreement shall be in a form as prepared by the city attorney and shall contain provisions requiring the property owner(s)/developer(s) to conform to all applicable city development standards. The development agreement shall also provide to the city of Auburn a nonrevocable power of attorney that authorizes the city of Auburn to include the subject property in an annexation at any time.
C. “Development standards” mean standards or comprehensive plan policies adopted by the city of Auburn that regulate development of property and include but are not limited to those related to zoning, subdivision, shorelines, utilities, streets, parks, land use, or sensitive areas. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999.)

14.18.010 Preapplication conference.
Persons considering making application for water and/or sewer availability certificates other than for individual single-family homes are encouraged to request that a preapplication conference be held with appropriate city staff. Such request shall be directed to the planning director, and upon its receipt the director shall schedule a conference between the prospective applicant and appropriate city staff. The purpose of a preapplication conference is for the prospective applicant and city staff to gain a common understanding of the proposed development, and any procedures, rules, standards and policies which may apply. The prospective applicant is encouraged to bring to the conference whatever information deemed appropriate to help describe the existing nature of the site and its surroundings and the proposed nature of the contemplated and subsequent development. Such information may include photographs, sketches, and maps. The director or the prospective applicant may request that an additional conference or conferences be held to further the purpose of this section. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.020 Application, submittal and contents.
Application for water and/or sewer availability certificates shall be submitted to the department of planning and development, shall be accompanied by applicable fees as established by ordinance and shall include the following:
A. A completed application form, blank copies of which are available from the department;
B. Legal Description of the Property. Description must be described with a “metes and bounds” legal description, unless the property is part of a recorded subdivision. Along with the legal description, the parcel number (tax I.D. number) must also be provided;

        c. Location and size of all existing and proposed utilities;
        d. Location and layout of off-street parking;
        e. Any additional information required by the planning director that may be needed to determine if the project is consistent with city development standards.
D. If, for some reason, the development cannot meet city development standards the property owner(s)/developer(s) may request a modification to the development standard as it applies to the particular development. The property owner(s)/developer(s) shall submit a letter to the city planning director requesting said modification that describes the particular circumstance and the development standard that cannot be met together with an explanation of why it cannot be met. The request for modification shall be considered as part of the public hearing required by ACC 14.18.030 and cannot be granted unless it is consistent with the findings of fact as outlined in ACC 14.18.070(B);
E. Filing Fees. 
    1. Individual single-family home: none;
    2. All others: $250.00. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5147 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.030 Public hearing.
A. Upon determination of a complete application for development, other than an individual single-family home, the director shall tentatively set a date for a public hearing to be held before the city’s hearing examiner. Every hearing held for the purposes of this chapter shall be open to the public, and a record of the hearing shall be kept and made available for public inspection.
B. Any notice of public hearing required by this section shall include the hour, date and location of the hearing and a description of the property. The description may be in the form of either a vicinity location sketch or a written description other than a legal description.
C. The planning director shall cause notice of the hearing to be given in the following manner:
    1. Notice shall be published not less than 10 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where the real property is located;
    2. Requiring the subject property posted in accordance with the applicable requirements of Chapter 1.27 ACC. (Ord. 6532 § 20, 2014; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5811 § 3, 2003; Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.040 Administrative review.
The director shall forward to appropriate city departments and divisions one copy of the application for water and/or sewer availability, together with copies of any appropriate accompanying documents. The city departments and divisions shall review the proposal as to the availability of water and sewer, the conformance of the proposal to any plans, city policies or regulations pertaining to streets, utilities; and any other issues related to the interests and responsibilities of the department or division. The application will then be processed in the following manner:
A. Individual Single-Family Home. If upon review by city departments and divisions, it is found that the single-family home meets all relevant city development standards, a development agreement shall be prepared and signed by the city and the applicant(s). The development agreement must be recorded by the county assessor’s office and returned to the city prior to the issuance of the water and/or sanitary sewer availability certificates. If it is found that, for any reason, the individual single-family home cannot meet city development standards, the application shall be processed as an “other development” as described below.
B. All Other Developments. If upon completion of review by city departments and divisions it is found that the development meets or is capable of meeting all relevant city development standards, a development agreement will be drafted. If there are modifications to development standards those modifications shall be reflected in the agreement. The agreement will then be forwarded to the planning and development committee for a public hearing as outlined in ACC 14.18.030 and 14.18.050. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5170 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.050 Hearing examiner.
The hearing examiner, following the closure of the public hearing, shall recommend to the city council that the city sign a development agreement with the applicant or to not sign a development agreement with the applicant. The hearing examiner shall not recommend approval of the development agreement unless it finds the proposal is in conformance with the findings of fact as outlined in ACC 14.18.070(A). (Ord. 6532 § 21, 2014; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.060 City council review.
A. Upon receipt of the hearing examiner’s recommendation, the city council shall, at its next public meeting, approve, remand the recommendation to the hearing examiner or schedule a closed record hearing. Any aggrieved person may request the council to conduct its own closed record hearing. The council can only amend or reject the hearing examiner’s recommendation.
B. If the council holds its own closed record hearing on a proposed development agreement, the council shall consider the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the hearing examiner’s public hearing. After conducting its own closed record hearing the council may approve, approve with conditions, reject or return the application to the applicant for corrections or modifications.
C. When the council makes its decision on the development agreement, it shall pass a resolution prepared by the city attorney. A resolution prepared under this subsection shall include formal findings of fact and conclusions supporting the decision. If the development meets all city development standards, the findings shall affirm that the development conforms with all applicable city development standards. If the development agreement allows modifications from some city standards, the modifications shall be specified in the resolution. (Ord. 6532 § 22, 2014; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5785 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.070 Findings of fact.
A. The development agreement shall be recommended for signing only if findings of fact are drawn to support the following:
    1. The development is consistent with city development standards; and
    2. The development is consistent with the city comprehensive plan; and
    3. The property cannot be annexed immediately.
B. Modifications to city development standards may be granted only if findings of fact are drawn to support the following:
    1. That special circumstances related to the size, shape, topography, location or surroundings of the subject property do not provide the owner with the development rights and privileges permitted to other similar properties in the vicinity and in the zoning district in which the subject property is located; or
    2. That, because of the special circumstances, the development of the property in strict conformity with city standards will not allow a reasonable and harmonious use of the property; or
    3. When applying city standards will result in a distinct “discontinuity” with adjacent development which was previously approved or constructed to county standards; or
    4. When applying city standards puts the developer in a position where the county will not allow that development to take place. (Ord. 5170 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.074 Conditions of approval.
In order to ensure compliance with the terms of this chapter conditions of approval may be required as part of the development agreement. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999.)

14.18.080 Notice of decision to applicant.
A. Following passage of a resolution approving or rejecting a development agreement, the director shall notify the applicant of the decision. The notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the passed resolution. If the resolution is to approve the development agreement, the notice shall advise the applicant that the development agreement must be signed by the applicant and recorded by the county assessor’s office. The development agreement must be returned to the city prior to the issuance of the water and/or sewer availability certificates.
B. The development agreement must be approved by the city prior to any application, plans or other submittals that are submitted to the county.

14.18.090 Adjustments of an approved development agreement.
A. Minor Adjustments. Minor adjustments may be made and approved by the planning director. Minor adjustments are those which do not violate the terms of the development agreement.
B. Major Adjustments. Major adjustments are those which, when determined by the planning director, violate the terms of the development agreement. When the planning director determines a change constitutes a major adjustment, an amendment to the development agreement is required and the process is the same as a new application. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999; Ord. 4872 § 1, 1996.)

14.18.094 Compliance with this chapter and the terms of a development agreement.
The city of Auburn reserves the right to withhold or terminate water and/or sanitary service to a development that does not comply with the terms of its development agreement and/or the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 5306 § 1, 1999.)

14.18.100 Time limitations.

14.20.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules, regulations, requirements, and standards for the closure or change of use of mobile home parks in the city, insuring that the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city shall be promoted and protected; that orderly growth, development, and proper use of land shall be insured; and that conformance with provisions set forth in the city comprehensive plan are followed. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.020 Scope.
This chapter applies to the closure or change in use of mobile home parks. This chapter shall apply to all lands within the corporate boundaries of the city. Where this chapter imposes greater restrictions or higher standards upon the development of land than other laws, ordinances, codes or restrictive covenants, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.030 Enforcement – Inspection.
Regarding the closure of mobile home parks, it shall be the duty of the planning director to enforce the applicable provisions of this chapter. The planning director and/or his/her designee may inspect any mobile home park in order to verify compliance with this chapter. Failure to make such inspection shall not constitute a waiver of any of the provisions of this chapter. For inspection purposes, the planning director and/or his/her duly authorized representative shall have the right and is hereby empowered to enter any mobile home park. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.040 Exceptions.
Upon proper application by the affected property owner to the city’s hearing examiner, pursuant to the provisions of the Auburn City Code (ACC), and following a public hearing on the application, the hearing examiner may grant an exception from the requirements of this chapter when undue hardship may be created as a result of strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter. In deciding any exception, the hearing examiner may prescribe conditions that he/she deems necessary to or desirable for the public interest. No exceptions shall be granted unless the hearing examiner finds that:
A. There are special physical circumstances or conditions affecting the property such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use or development of his land; and
B. The exception is necessary to insure such property the rights and privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under similar circumstances; and
C. The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare or injurious to the property in the vicinity. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.050 Penalties.
Any person, firm, corporation or association, or any agent of any person, firm, corporation or association who violates the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 for each such violation, or imprisonment for a period not to exceed 90 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.060 Liability.
This chapter shall not be construed to relieve from or lessen the responsibility of any person closing a mobile home park in the city for damages to anyone injured or damaged either in person or property by any defect therein; nor shall the city or any agent thereof be held as assuming such liability by reason of any preliminary or final approval or by issuance of any permits or certificates authorized herein. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.070 Eviction notices for change of use or closure of a mobile home park.
A. Before a mobile home park owner may issue eviction notices pursuant to a closure or change of use under Chapter 59.21 RCW, the mobile home park owner must first submit to the planning and development department a relocation report and plan that meets the requirements of ACC 14.20.080. If applying for a change of use, the mobile home park owner shall submit the relocation report and plan together with all other necessary applications. Once the planning director determines that the relocation report and plan meets the requirements of ACC 14.20.080, the planning director shall approve the relocation report and plan and return a copy of the approved plan to the mobile home park owner. If the planning director determines that the relocation report and plan does not meet the requirements of ACC 14.20.080, the planning director may require the mobile home park owner to amend or supplement the relocation report and plan as necessary to comply with this chapter before approving it.
B. No sooner than upon approval of the relocation report and plan, the owner of the mobile home park may issue the 12-month closure notice to the mobile home park tenants. The closure notice shall comply with RCW 59.20.080 and 59.21.030, as amended. No mobile home owner who rents a mobile home lot may be evicted until the 12-month notice period expires, except pursuant to the State Mobile Home Landlord-Tenant Act, Chapter 59.20 RCW. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.080 Relocation report and plan.

The relocation report and plan must provide that the mobile home park owner will assist each mobile home park tenant household to relocate, in addition to making any state or federal required relocation payments. Such assistance must include providing tenants an inventory of relocation resources, referring tenants to alternative public and private subsidized housing resources, helping tenants obtain and complete the necessary application forms for state-required relocation assistance, and helping tenants to move the mobile homes from the mobile home park. Further, the relocation report and plan shall contain the following information:
    1. The name, address, and family composition for each mobile home park tenant household, and the expiration date of the lease for each household;
    2. The condition, size, ownership status, HUD and/or State Department of Labor and Industries certification status, and probable mobility of each mobile home occupying a mobile home lot;
    3. Copies of all lease or rental agreement forms the mobile home park owner currently has in place with mobile home park tenants;
    4. To the extent mobile home park tenants voluntarily make such information available, a confidential listing of current monthly housing costs, including space rent, mobile home rent or other payments and utilities, for each mobile home park tenant household;
    5. To the extent mobile home park tenants voluntarily make such information available, a confidential listing of gross annual income for each mobile home park tenant household;
    6. An inventory of relocation resources, including available mobile home spaces in King, Snohomish, Kitsap and Pierce Counties, as well as mobile home age or size restrictions each park may have in place;
    7. Actions the mobile home park owner will take to refer mobile home park tenants to alternative public and private subsidized housing resources;
    8. Actions the mobile home park owner will take to assist mobile home park tenants to move the mobile homes from the mobile home park;
    9. Other actions the owner will take to minimize the hardship mobile home park tenant households suffer as a result of the closure or conversion of the mobile home park; and
    10. A statement of the anticipated timing for park closure.
B. The planning director may require the mobile home park owner to designate a relocation coordinator to administer the provisions of the relocation report and plan and work with the mobile home park tenants, the planning and development department, and other city and state offices to ensure compliance with the relocation report and plan and with state laws governing mobile home park relocation assistance, eviction notification, and landlord/tenant responsibilities.
C. The owner shall make available to any mobile home park tenant residing in the mobile home park copies of the proposed relocation report and plan, with confidential information deleted. Within 14 days of the planning director’s approval of the relocation report and plan, a copy of the approved relocation report and plan shall be mailed by the owner to each mobile home park tenant.
D. The mobile home park owner shall update with the planning and development department the information required under this section to include any change of circumstances occurring after submission of the relocation report and plan that affects the relocation report and plan’s implementation. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.090 Certificate of completion of the relocation report and plan.
No mobile home park owner may close a mobile home park, or obtain final approval of a comprehensive plan or zoning redesignation until the mobile home park owner obtains a certificate of completion from the planning and development department. The planning director shall issue a certificate of completion only if satisfied that the owner has complied with the provisions of an approved relocation report and plan, the eviction notice requirements of RCW 59.20.080 and 59.21.030, the relocation assistance requirements of RCW 59.21.021, and any additional requirements imposed in connection with required city applications. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.100 Notice of provisions.
It is unlawful for any party who is required to submit a relocation report and plan to the city pursuant to this chapter to sell, lease or rent any mobile home or mobile home park rental space without providing a copy of such relocation report and plan to the prospective purchaser, lessee, or renter, and advising the same, in writing, of the provisions of ACC 14.20.070 through 14.20.120 and the status of such relocation report and plan. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.110 Administration.
The planning director shall administer and enforce ACC 14.20.070 through 14.20.120. Whenever an owner or an owner’s agent fails to comply with the provisions of ACC 14.20.070 through 14.20.120, the following may occur:
A. The planning director may deny, revoke, or condition a certificate of completion, a permit, or another approval;
B. Any other city permits or approvals may be conditioned on the owner’s successful completion of remedial actions deemed necessary by the planning director to carry out the purposes of ACC 14.20.070 through 14.20.120. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.120 Appeal.
Any appeal from an administrative determination under ACC 14.20.070(A), 14.20.090, and 14.20.110(A) shall be filed within 14 days of the determination and shall be processed in accordance with the procedures established for appeals of administrative decisions under ACC 18.70.050. (Ord. 6184 § 7, 2008; Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

14.20.130 Closure and government sponsorship.
A. If an eminent domain action by a federal, state or local agency causes closure of a mobile home park and the procedures set forth in the Federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act, 42 USC 4601 et seq., and the regulations of 49 CFR Part 24 or the Relocation Assistance – Real Property Acquisition Policy Act of Chapter 8.26 RCW and the regulations of Chapter 468-100 WAC are followed, the requirements of those acts and regulations will supersede the requirements of ACC 14.20.070 through 14.20.120.
B. If a condemnation action of the city causes closure of a mobile home park, the city will be responsible for fulfilling the requirements of the standards contained herein. If the city chooses to follow portions of the state act and regulations and the planning director determine that there is a conflict or redundancy between the portions of the state act and regulations being followed by the city, and the standards contained herein, the state act shall take precedence in such areas of conflict or redundancy. If the state act is followed in all respects, such act will supersede the requirements of this section and the standards contained herein. (Ord. 5746 § 1, 2003.)

    2. If any of the information required by this section is not available at the time the application is submitted, the applicant shall note what information is not available. The unavailability of that information shall not cause the application to be deemed incomplete for the purposes of vesting under this section.

This fee shall be in addition to the normal plan review and building permit fees. The city may require the applicant to deposit an amount with this jurisdiction estimated in the discretion of the building official to be sufficient to cover anticipated costs to retain professional consultant services and to ensure reimbursement for such costs.

The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this code nor from any penalty prescribed by law.
B. Plan Review Fees. 
    1. When submittal documents are required by ACC 15.07.050, a plan review fee shall be paid at the time of submitting the submittal documents for plan review. The building official and/or the fire code official may have the option to charge a deposit in lieu of the full plan review fee, if the full amount is not known at the time. Any plan review deposit shall be applied toward the total plan review fee owed. The actual permit fees and related plan review fee shall be determined upon completion of the plan review and the balance owing shall be paid at the time of permit issuance. The plan review fee shall be a separate fee from the permit fees specified in this section and are in addition to the permit fees. When submittal documents are incomplete or changed so as to require additional plan review or when the project involves deferred submittal items as defined in IBC Section 107.3.4.2, an additional plan review fee shall be charged at the rate shown in the fee code established by the jurisdiction.
    2. Stock Plan Program. When plans are submitted under the “stock plan program,” a plan review fee shall be paid at the time of application for each stock plan.

All portions of fees paid as a deposit amount shall be applied to the total plan review fees owed. The applicant shall be required to pay the balance of amount owed for the plan review. Valuations used to compute the permit fees shall include all options submitted with a registered plan. When a registered plan consists of a number of plan options that can produce any number of similar but different buildings, the building official may charge plan review fees based on each different building configuration. Plan review fees shall be paid for at the time of application for a building permit. The plan review fees specified in this subsection are separate fees from the permit fees specified in the fee code, and are in addition to the permit fees.
C. Refunds. 
    1. Before Permit Issuance. The building official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is done. The building official shall not authorize refunding of any fee paid except on written application filed by the original permittee not later than 180 days after the date of application.
    2. After Permit Issuance. The building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid hereunder, which was erroneously paid or collected. When no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this code, the building official may authorize refunding of not more than the full amount of the permit fee paid, less the current rate of the additional resubmittal fee adopted by the city of Auburn fee schedule; except that no refunds will be processed for permits 360 days from date of expiration where no work has been done. (Ord. 6601 § 9, 2016; Ord. 6469 § 2, 2013; Ord. 6310 § 6, 2010; Ord. 6104 § 5, 2007; Ord. 5874 § (108), 2004.)

A. Use and Occupancy. No building or structure shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building or structure or portion of the building or structure shall be made until the building official has issued a certificate of occupancy as provided for in this section.

Any actual or potential conflict of interest shall be disclosed by the hearing examiner to the parties immediately upon discovery of such conflict. Participants in the hearing process have the right, insofar as possible, to have the examiner free from personal interest or pre-hearing contacts on issues considered by him/her. It is recognized that there is a countervailing public right to free access to public officials on any matter. If such personal or pre-hearing interest contact impairs the examiner’s ability to act on the matter, the hearing examiner shall state and shall abstain therefrom to the end that the proceeding is fair and has the appearance of fairness, unless all parties agree in writing to have the matter heard by said examiner. If all parties do not agree and the hearing examiner must abstain, the mayor shall be notified and the mayor shall appoint a hearing examiner pro tem to sit in the hearing examiner’s stead.
    4. Freedom from Improper Influence. No council member, city official, or any other person shall attempt to interfere with or improperly influence the examiner or examiner pro tempore in the performance of his/her designated duties.

    9. Effect of Failure to Appeal. Failure of any person to file an appeal in accordance with provisions of this section shall constitute a waiver of any right to an administrative hearing and adjudication of the building official’s or fire code official’s decisions or determinations.
    10. Scope of Hearing on Appeal. Only those matters or issues specifically raised by the appellant shall be considered in the hearing of the appeal.
    11. Hearing Procedures.

If payment of the registration fee, late registration fee penalty or the appeal hearing cancellation fee is not received within 30 days of the day the notice of a late fee is mailed, the city may initiate the enforcement of penalties and/or begin the collection process. The city shall inform the alarm user of the right to appeal the validity of the false alarm determination, as provided in ACC 15.56.080. (Ord. 5819 § 9, 2004; Ord. 5716 § 2, 2002; Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.56.040 Additional duties of alarm user.
A. The premises shall display the registration decal at or near the main entrance, which shall be clearly visible and readable from the exterior of the premises.
B. The premises shall display the street address at or near the front of the premises and at other places where access is available, such as from an alley or parking lot. The street address shall be clearly visible and readable from the exterior of the premises.
C. If requested to do so by the department, the alarm user or his or her designee shall respond to the premises following activation of an alarm system for which a registration has been issued within a reasonable time, and in any event, within one hour after said notification. (Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.56.050 Alarm business duties.
Every alarm system monitoring company engaging in business activities in the city of Auburn shall:
A. Be registered to do business in the city of Auburn.
B. Submit standard user form instructions to the police chief. If the police chief finds the instructions are incomplete, unclear, or inadequate, the police chief may require the alarm business to revise the instructions to comply with subsection D of this section and then to distribute the revised instructions to its alarm users.
C. Provide the police chief information about the nature of its property alarms, burglary alarms, robbery alarms and panic alarms; its method of monitoring; its program for preventing false alarms, and its method of disconnecting audible alarms.
D. Furnish the user with instructions that provide information to enable the user to operate the alarm system at any time. The alarm business shall also inform each alarm user of the requirement to obtain a registration and where it can be obtained.
E. Establish a Process for Alarm Verification. The verification process shall not take more than five minutes, calculated from the time that the alarm signal has been accepted by the alarm business monitoring the system, until a decision is made whether to call for a police dispatch. The means of verification may include one or more of the following:
    1. The establishment of voice communication with an authorized person at or near the premises who may indicate whether or not need for immediate police assistance or investigation exists;
    2. A feature that permits the alarm system user or a person authorized by the user to send a special signal to the alarm system monitoring company that will cancel an alarm immediately after it has been sent and prevent the monitoring company calling for a police dispatch;
    3. The installation of a video system that provides the alarm system monitoring company when the signal is received with the ability to ascertain that activity is occurring which warrants immediate police assistance or investigation;
    4. A confirmation that a signal reflects a need for immediate police assistance or investigation either by the alarm system user, or a person at or near the premises before dispatching police; or
    5. An alternate system that the police chief determines has, or is likely to have, a high degree of reliability.
F. Coordinate with the department’s communication center to develop a process to cancel an alarm dispatch that is consistent with the communication center’s standard operating procedures.
G. Provide the department’s communication center when requesting an alarm response with the registration number for that premises, and the department need not respond if the registration number is not provided. (Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.56.060 Nonpermitted system and uses.
A. No person shall operate or use an alarm system which emits an audible sound where such emission does not automatically cease within 15 minutes. Nothing in this section shall limit the duration of a fire or other evacuation alarm during a bona fide emergency when the sound may assist in saving life or avoiding injury.
B. No person shall use an alarm system to protect more than one business and/or private residence without receiving a separate registration for each business and/or private residence to be protected.
C. No person shall operate or use any alarm system for which the registration has been revoked.
D. No person shall operate or use any alarm system which automatically dials the Auburn police department or Valley Communication Center (911) directly and delivers a prerecorded message.
E. No person shall use an alarm system covering doors and windows that transmits a “panic alarm” notification. (Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.56.070 Special registrations.
A. An alarm user required by federal, state, county or municipal law, regulation, rule or ordinance to install, maintain and operate an alarm system shall be subject to the alarm system regulations, provided:
    1. A registration shall be designated a special alarm user’s registration.
    2. A special alarm user’s registration for a system that has five false alarms in a registration year shall not be subject to the no response procedure and shall pay the penalty fees and service charges.
B. An alarm user that is a governmental political unit shall be subject to this chapter; but a registration shall be issued without payment of a fee and shall not be subject to service charges or the imposition of any penalty provided herein. (Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.56.080 Administrative hearing.
A. An alarm user may appeal the validity of a false alarm determination to the police chief. The appeal shall be in writing and shall be requested within 10 days of the notice of penalty received from the city finance department. Failure to contest the false alarm determination in the required time period results in a conclusive presumption for all purposes that the alarm was false.
B. If a hearing is requested, written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be served on the user by the police chief, by certified mail, at least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing, which shall not be more than 21 nor less than 10 days after the filing of the request for hearing.
C. The hearing shall be before the police chief. The police chief may appoint another person to be an administrative hearing officer to hear the appeals and to render judgment. The alarm user and the police chief shall have the right to present written and oral evidence. If the police chief determines that the false alarms alleged have occurred in a registration year, the police chief may issue written findings waiving, expunging or entering a false alarm designation on an alarm user’s record. If false alarm designations are entered on the alarm user’s record, the finance department shall pursue the collection of the penalty fines. If the civil penalty is not found to be proper, then the alarm user shall bear no costs.
D. If a hearing is canceled more than 10 days after its request, then a cancellation fee as set forth in the fee resolution must be paid in addition to the amount of the civil infraction.
E. In accordance with RCW 46.55.240(1)(d), a decision made by an administrative hearing officer may be appealed to the King County district court for final judgment. (Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.56.090 Violations – Penalties.
In addition to the penalties and regulations provided herein, who violates any provisions of this chapter shall be found to have committed a Class I civil infraction. (Ord. 5224 § 1, 1999.)

15.68.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. To protect human life, health, and to protect property;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;
G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard;
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions;
I. To qualify the city of Auburn for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, thereby giving citizens and businesses the opportunity to purchase flood insurance;
J. To maintain the quality of water in rivers, streams, and lakes, and their floodplains so as to protect public water supplies, areas of the public trust, and wildlife habitat protected by the Endangered Species Act;
K. To retain the natural channel, shoreline, and floodplain creation processes and other natural floodplain functions that protect, create, and maintain habitat for threatened and endangered species; and
L. To prevent or minimize loss of hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological functions of floodplains and stream channels. (Ord. 6295 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6161 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4820 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4357 § 2(1.3), 1989.)

15.68.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage;
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas;
F. Identifying the regulatory floodplain, the special flood hazard area, and the protected area and the supporting technical data needed to delineate those areas;
G. Establishing a permit requirement so that all human development that may affect flood hazards, water quality, and habitat is reviewed before it is constructed;
H. Setting minimum protection standards for all development to ensure that the development will not increase the potential for flood damage or adversely affect natural floodplain functions;
I. Setting minimum standards to protect new and substantially improved structures from flood damage; and
J. Specifying additional habitat protection criteria.  Some projects do not need a floodplain permit (see ACC 15.68.130(B) and (C)); whereas other projects require a floodplain permit, but do not require the habitat impact assessment required in this chapter (see ACC 15.68.130(D)). For all other development projects, the applicant must assess their impact on those factors that contribute to increased flood hazard and degradation of habitat. If the assessment concludes that there will be an adverse effect, the permit will be denied, unless the project is redesigned to mitigate the adverse effects. (Ord. 6295 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6161 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4820 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4357 § 2(1.4), 1989.)

Article II. Definitions

15.68.050 Interpretation of language.
Unless specifically defined in this article, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. (Ord. 6295 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6161 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4820 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4357 § 2(2.0), 1989.)

15.68.060 Definitions.
As used in this chapter:
A. “Adversely affect/adverse effect” means effects that are a direct or indirect result of the proposed action or its interrelated or interdependent actions and the effect is not discountable, insignificant or beneficial, where:
    1. a. Discountable effects are extremely unlikely to occur; and
        b. Insignificant effects relate to the size of the impact and should never reach the scale where a take occurs. Based on best judgment, a person would not be able to meaningfully measure, detect, or evaluate insignificant effects, or expect discountable effects to occur.
    2. Beneficial effects are contemporaneous positive effects without any adverse effects. In the event that the overall effect of the proposed action is beneficial, but is also likely to cause some adverse effects, then the proposed action is considered to result in an adverse effect.
B. “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Also referred to as the “100-year flood.” The area subject to the base flood is the special flood hazard area (SFHA), designated on flood insurance rate maps as Zone A, including AE, AO, AH, and A1 – 99.
C. “Base flood elevation” means the elevation of the base flood above the datum of the effective FIRM.
    1. The base flood elevation for the SFHAs of the city shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study for the city.
    2. The base flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as a Zone AH or Zone AO shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map. Where base flood depths are not available in Zone AO, the base flood elevation shall be considered to be two feet above the highest grade adjacent to the structure.
    3. Where base flood elevation data are not provided on the flood insurance study for the city, base flood elevation data available from a federal, state, or other authoritative source shall be used, if available. Where base flood elevation data are not available from other authoritative sources, applicants for approval of new subdivisions and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include such data with their permit applications. This data must be approved by the floodplain administrator.
D. “Basement” means any area of the structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
E. “Channel migration area” means the area within the lateral extent of likely stream channel movement due to stream bank destabilization and erosion, rapid stream incision, aggradation, avulsions, and shifts in location of stream channels plus 50 feet.
    1. The channel migration area shall be the total area occupied by the river channel, the severe channel migration hazard area, and the moderate channel migration hazard area as delineated in the Green River Channel Migration Study published by King County dated December 1993 plus 50 feet.
    2. Where more than one channel migration zone has been delineated, the floodplain administrator shall use the delineation that has been adopted for other local regulatory purposes.
F. “Critical facility” means a facility necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare during a flood. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency operations installations, water and wastewater treatment plants, electric power stations, and installations which produce, use, or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (other than consumer products containing hazardous substances or hazardous waste intended for household use).
G. “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate in the regulatory floodplain, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials, subdivision of land, removal of more than five percent of the native vegetation on the property, or alteration of natural site characteristics.
H. “Dry floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural measures that prevent flood waters from entering a structure.
I. “Elevation certificate” means the official form (FEMA Form 81-31) used to provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with provisions of this chapter and determine the proper flood insurance premium rate.
J. “Equivalent elevation” means having similar relationship to ordinary high water and to the best available 10-year, 50-year and 100-year water surface profiles.
K. “FEMA” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the agency responsible for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
L. “Fish and wildlife habitat conservation area” means lands needed to maintain species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic distribution so that isolated subpopulations are not created. These areas are designated by the city pursuant to the Washington State Growth Management Act (WAC 365-190-080).
M. “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
    1. The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
    2. The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
N. “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
O. “Flood insurance study” means the official report(s) provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
P. “Flood protection elevation (FPE)” means the elevation above the datum of the effective FIRM to which new and substantially improved structures must be protected from flood damage.
Q. “Floodway” means the channel of a stream or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. The floodway shall be as delineated on the flood insurance rate map. Where floodway data are not provided on the flood insurance study for the city, floodway data available from a federal, state, or other authoritative source shall be used, if available. Where floodway data is not available from another authoritative source, applicants for approval of new subdivisions and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include such data with their permit applications. This data must be approved by the floodplain administrator. This provision does not apply to applications for permits for small projects on large lots, such as constructing a single-family home.
R. “Historic structure” means a structure that:
    1. Is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Washington Heritage Register, or the Washington Heritage Barn Register, or has been designated a landmark or been issued a certificate of appropriateness under the city’s historic preservation ordinance.
    2. Has been certified to contribute to the historical significance of a registered historic district.
S. “Hyporheic zone” means a saturated layer of rock or sediment beneath and/or adjacent to a stream channel that contains some proportion of channel water or that has been altered by channel water infiltration.
T. “Impervious surface” means a hard surface area which causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow present under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, roof tops, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots or storage areas, concrete or asphalt paving, gravel roads, packed earthen materials, and oiled, macadam or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of stormwater.
U. “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) measured at the walking surface of the floor. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor as long as that enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found in ACC 15.68.170(A)(7).
V. “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes, the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar recreational vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term “manufactured home” does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar recreational vehicles.
W. “Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
X. “Market value” shall mean the current assessed value as established by the most recent tax roll of the county assessor in which the property is located. An applicant may, at applicant’s expense, provide an appraisal to determine market value.
Y. “Native vegetation” means plant species that are indigenous to the community’s area and that reasonably could be expected to naturally occur on the site.
Z. “Natural floodplain functions” means the contribution that a floodplain makes to support habitat, including, but not limited to, providing flood storage and conveyance, reducing flood velocities, reducing sedimentation, filtering nutrients and impurities from runoff, processing organic wastes, moderating temperature fluctuations, and providing breeding and feeding grounds for aquatic or riparian species.
AA. “New construction” means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
BB. “Protected area” means the lands that lie within the boundaries of the floodway, the riparian habitat zone, and the channel migration area. In riverine areas, where a floodway has not been designated in accordance with this chapter, the protected area is comprised of those lands that lie within the boundaries of the riparian habitat zone, the channel migration area, and the SFHA.
CC. “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle:
    1. Built on a single chassis;
    2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
    3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
    4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreation, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
DD. “Regulatory floodplain” means the area of the special flood hazard area and all protected areas within the city of Auburn. It also includes newly designated special flood hazard areas and protected areas that are delineated pursuant to city law.
EE. “Riparian” means of, adjacent to, or living on, the bank of a stream, lake, pond, sound, or other water body.
FF. “Riparian habitat zone” means the water body and adjacent land areas that are likely to support aquatic and riparian habitat as detailed in this chapter. The size and location of the riparian habitat zone is dependent on the type of water body. The riparian habitat zone includes the water body and adjacent lands, measured perpendicularly from ordinary high water on both sides of the water body:
    1. Marine and lake shorelines and Type S streams that are designated “shorelines of the state”: 250 feet.
    2. Type F (fish bearing) streams greater than five feet wide and marine shorelines: 200 feet.
    3. Type F streams less than five feet wide and lakes: 150 feet.
    4. Type N (nonsalmonid-bearing) perennial and seasonal streams with unstable slopes: 225 feet.
    5. All other Type N (nonsalmonid-bearing) perennial and seasonal streams: 150 feet.
In addition, the riparian habitat zone may include additional land areas that the floodplain administrator determines are likely to support aquatic and riparian habitat.
GG. “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means the land subject to inundation by the base flood. Special flood hazard areas are identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the scientific and engineering reports entitled “Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington and Incorporated Areas,” dated April 19, 2005, and any revisions thereto, and “Flood Insurance Study for Pierce County, Washington and Unincorporated Areas,” dated August 19, 1987, and any revisions thereto, and designated on associated flood insurance rate maps with the letter A, including AE, AO, AH, A1 – 99.
HH. “Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, addition, placement or other improvement that occurred before the permit’s expiration date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the “actual start of construction” means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
II. “Structure” means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
JJ. “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
KK. “Substantial improvement” or “substantially improved” means any repair, reconstruction, addition, replacement or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of such structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
The term does not, however, include either:
    1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
    2. Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
LL. “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
MM. “Water typing” means a system for classifying water bodies according to their size and fish habitat characteristics. The Washington Department of Natural Resources Forest Practices Water Typing Classification System is hereby adopted by reference. The system defines four water types:
    1. Type “S” – Shoreline: Streams that are designated “shorelines of the state,” including marine shorelines.
    2. Type “F” – Fish: Streams that are known to be used by fish or meet the physical criteria to be potentially used by fish.
    3. Type “NP” – Non-fish perennial streams.
    4. Type “NS” – Non-fish seasonal streams.
NN. “Zone” means one or more areas delineated on the FIRM. The following zones may be used on the adopted FIRM. The special flood hazard area is comprised of the A Zone.
    1. A: SFHA where no base flood elevation is provided.
    2. A#: Numbered A zones (e.g., A7 or A14), SFHA with a base flood elevation.
    3. AE: SFHA with a base flood elevation.
    4. AO: SFHA subject to inundation by shallow flooding usually resulting from sheet flow on sloping terrain, with average depths between one and three feet. Average flood depths are shown.
    5. AH: SFHA subject to inundation by shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) with average depths between one and three feet. Base flood elevations are shown.
    6. B: The area between the SFHA and the 500-year flood of the primary source of flooding. It may also be an area with a local, shallow flooding problem or an area protected by a levee.
    7. C: An area of minimal flood hazard, as above the 500-year flood level of the primary source of flooding. B and C zones may have flooding that does not meet the criteria to be mapped as a special flood hazard area, especially ponding and local drainage problems.
    8. D: Area of undetermined but possible flood hazard.
    9. X: The area outside the mapped SFHA.
    10. Shaded X: The same as a Zone B, in subsection (NN)(6) of this section. (Ord. 6295 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6161 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4820 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4357 § 2(2.1 – 2.17), 1989.)

The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.
D. Native Vegetation. The site plan required for development in the regulatory floodplain shall show existing native vegetation.
    1. In the riparian habitat zone, native vegetation shall be left undisturbed, except if in connection with an activity allowed in the regulatory floodplain without a permit, and except for activities with the sole purpose of creating, restoring or enhancing natural functions associated with floodplains, streams, lakes, estuaries, marine areas, habitat, and riparian areas that meet federal and state standards, provided the activities do not include structures, grading, fill, or impervious surfaces.
    2. Outside the riparian habitat zone, removal of native vegetation shall not exceed 35 percent of the surface area of the portion of the site in the regulatory floodplain. Native vegetation in the riparian habitat zone portion of the property can be counted toward this requirement.
    3. If the proposed project does not meet the criteria of this chapter, a habitat impact assessment shall be conducted pursuant to ACC 15.68.135(J) and, if indicated by that assessment, a habitat mitigation plan shall be prepared and implemented pursuant to ACC 15.68.135(K).

15.74.030 Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:
A. “Accelerated erosion” means erosion much more rapid than normal or geologic erosion, primarily as a result of the influence of the activities of man or, in some cases, of the animals or natural catastrophes that expose bare surfaces (e.g., fires).
B. “Clearing” means the destruction and removal of vegetation by manual, mechanical, or chemical methods.
C. “Filling” means the act of transporting or placing (by any manner or mechanism) fill material from, to, or on any soil surface, natural vegetative covering of soil surface, or fill material (including temporary stockpiling of fill material).
D. “Grading” means any excavating, filling, clearing, or re-contouring of the ground surface or combination thereof.
E. “Ground cover” means small plants such as salal, ferns, mosses, grasses or other types of vegetation which normally cover the ground, including trees less than six inches in diameter measured at 24 inches above ground level, which renders the surface of the soil stable against accelerated erosion.
F. “Impervious surface” means a hard surface area that either prevents or retards the entry of water into the soil mantle as under natural conditions prior to development. A hard surface area which causes water to run off in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow from the flow under natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, walkways, patios, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, concrete or asphalt paving, gravel roads, packed earthen materials, and oiled macadam or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of storm water. Open, uncovered retention/detention facilities shall not be considered as impervious surfaces for the purpose of determining whether the thresholds for application of minimum requirements are exceeded. Open, uncovered retention/detention facilities shall be considered impervious surfaces for purposes of runoff modeling.
G. “Land disturbing activity” means any activity that results in movement of earth, or a change in the existing soil cover (both vegetative and nonvegetative) and/or the existing soil topography. Land disturbing activities include, but are not limited to, clearing, grading, filling, and excavation. Compaction that is associated with stabilization of structures and road construction shall also be considered land disturbing activity. Vegetation maintenance practices are not considered land disturbing activity.
H. “Permanent structure” means any buildings which are immovable including homes, garages, barns, storage buildings, or a driveway not wider than 20 feet which is the exclusive route of ingress and egress to an immovable garage or carport.
I. “Pre-loading” means the placement of material with the intent to surcharge and compress subsurface soils for a limited amount of time.
J. “Sedimentation” means the process by which solid particulate matter is transported by water off the site of the land disturbing activity and settles onto land or the bed of a creek, stream, river, wetland, pond, lake, or other water body.
K. “Stockpiling” means the placement of material with the intent to remove at a later time.
L. “Tree” means any self-supporting perennial woody plant characterized by natural growth of one main stem or trunk with a definite crown, and maturing at a height of at least six feet above the ground.
M. “Shrubs” means any living terrestrial plant or vegetation other than a tree or ground cover on land.
N. “Significant tree” means a healthy evergreen tree, six inches or more in diameter measured four feet above grade, or a healthy deciduous tree four inches or more in diameter measured four feet above grade.
O. “Underdeveloped property” means any parcel which under the city’s zoning code may be further subdivided to allow further development, or is not already developed to the fullest zoning potential.
P. “Undeveloped property” means any parcel which has not been altered from its natural state by grading or filling or by construction of private structures or public infrastructure that allows further development. (Ord. 6601 § 33, 2016; Ord. 6283 § 13, 2009; Ord. 6146 § 1, 2007; Ord. 4861 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4266 § 1, 1988.)

15.74.040 Permit.
A. Application. Any owner or authorized agent who intends to clear, fill, or grade any property within the city, except those specifically exempted in ACC 15.74.050, shall first make an application to the city and obtain the required permit for the work. Applications shall be prepared by a licensed professional civil engineer and shall conform to the city’s design standards per Chapter 12.04 ACC. The city engineer shall have the authority to accept an application not prepared by a licensed professional engineer if the city engineer determines the scope of the project is such that a detailed set of plans is not required. An application for a clearing, filling, and grading permit shall be applied for and, where possible, processed concurrently with any other necessary permits or approvals. In addition, the city engineer may require off-site improvements prior to issuing any grading, filling or clearing permits when such improvements are required to mitigate the impacts of the proposed improvements.
B. Approval. The city engineer shall have the authority to approve, modify, approve with conditions, or deny the permit in accordance with the intended purposes of ACC 15.74.010. The city engineer shall also have the authority to determine the time frame when the land disturbing activity shall commence, when the project is to be completed, designated haul routes, seasonal and weather restrictions, and hours of operation.
C. Performance Guarantee. When the city engineer determines that steps must be taken to protect other property or the public right-of-way, then the applicant shall provide the city an assignment of funds or an irrevocable letter of credit or other similar security satisfactory to the city engineer, to ensure land disturbing activities are constructed and maintained in conformance with the approved construction drawings, standards, and any environmental requirements and that the impacts of the activities, including hauling impacts, are mitigated. The amount and duration of the financial guarantee will be determined by the city engineer, when required, and it shall be no less than $2,000 per acre. The financial guarantee shall be accompanied by an agreement granting the city and its agents the right to enter the property and perform work to mitigate and/or control impacts from such land disturbing activities utilizing the above-described satisfactory security. The agreement shall also hold the city harmless from all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees.
D. Fees. Fees shall be assessed in accordance with the city’s fee schedule.
E. Term. Work on grading, filling, or land clearing permits must begin within 180 days from the date of issuance of the permit. If work has not begun prior to this date, the permit shall expire and a new permit will be required prior to commencing any grading, filling, or clearing activities, and will be subject to city standards in effect at the time of the new permit. A six-month period of inactivity on the grading, filling or clearing work shall constitute expiration of the permit and a new permit will be required prior to recommencing grading, filling or clearing activities and will be subject to city standards in effect at the time of the new permit unless the applicant can demonstrate justification for the delay to the satisfaction of the city engineer. Work to maintain winterization requirements shall not be considered inactivity.
F. Inspection. Construction or work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the city engineer, or his/her designee, and such construction or work shall remain accessible for inspection purposes until approved by the city engineer or his/her designee.
G. Revocation of Permits. Failure of the property owner and/or permittee to comply with any or all of the provisions of this chapter or any or all provisions of a land clearing, filling, or grading permit may cause the city engineer to revoke the permit. If the permit is revoked, all operations shall cease until such time that the noncompliance is corrected.
H. Where applicable, the property owner is responsible for obtaining the appropriate permits from the city when the public right-of-way is used to clear, stockpile, or load products and/or debris resulting from any land disturbing activity.
I. Penalties. Any violation of the requirements of this chapter or the conditions of a land clearing, filling, and grading permit shall be enforced pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1.25 ACC; provided, that the penalty for such violation shall be $500.00, and each day, location and/or incident shall constitute a separate civil infraction. Additionally, each violator (each individual participating in a violation) shall constitute separate violations; provided, that if a violation involves more than 30,000 cubic yards of grading or fill work or more than 15 acres of land clearing, it shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $1,000 fine or up to 90 days in jail or both.
Any person who clears or disturbs property without first securing a permit pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to the penalties of this section and may be required to restore the site to the satisfaction of the city engineer. In addition all activity on the property shall cease until such time that a permit has been issued and there shall be no issuance of any other permit or approval until such time that a land clearing or filling and grading permit has been approved.
J. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city engineer may, within 10 business days of the city engineer’s written decision, appeal the decision to the hearing examiner who shall conduct a public hearing pursuant to ACC 18.70.040. (Ord. 6146 § 1, 2007; Ord. 4861 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4266 § 1, 1988.)

16.06.060 Determination of categorical exemption.
A. The city department which receives an application for a proposal, or initiates a proposal which is potentially subject to the environmental review requirements of SEPA, shall request the responsible official or the responsible official’s designee to make the following determinations:
    1. Whether the proposal is an “action” as defined by WAC 197-11-704; and
    2. If the proposal is an “action,” whether it is categorically exempt from the requirements of SEPA; and
    3. If the proposal is a nonexempt action, whether appropriate environmental review of the project has been conducted or commenced.
B. The responsible official or the responsible official’s designee shall be responsible for making the final decision required by this section.
C. The city recognizes that the list of categorical exemptions included in the SEPA rules cannot be relied upon as the final determination of when a proposed project, regardless of its environmental impact, must comply with SEPA and this chapter. Where the responsible official determines that a proposal has a reasonable likelihood of causing more than a moderate adverse impact on environmental quality, whether that impact is direct, indirect or cumulative, environmental review under SEPA shall be conducted.
D. It is recognized that a particular development or land use, although otherwise consistent with city regulations and policies, may create adverse impacts upon facilities, services, natural systems or the surrounding area when aggregated with the impacts of prior or reasonably anticipated future developments. The city shall evaluate such cumulative environmental impacts and make its environmental determinations and substantive decisions accordingly. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.065 Environmentally sensitive areas.
A. The following areas of the environment are designated as environmentally sensitive areas pursuant to RCW 36.70A.060 and WAC 197-11-908:
    1. Aquifer recharge areas;
    2. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas;
    3. Frequently flooded areas;
    4. Geologically hazardous areas; and
    5. Wetlands.
B. Within each of these environmentally sensitive areas, the responsible official shall implement city codes, ordinances, resolutions, plans and policies to conserve these areas and to preclude land uses and development which cause significant adverse impacts to these areas.
C. The city’s “critical area maps” provides the general location of environmentally sensitive areas within the city and is adopted by this reference as if fully set forth in this chapter. Site specific studies will be needed to identify the precise location and to assess the characteristics of the environmentally sensitive area. Whenever there is evidence of an environmentally sensitive area located within or in proximity to a nonexempt action, the responsible official may require site specific studies to determine the location and characteristics of the environmentally sensitive area, and potential mitigating measures. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.070 Environmental checklist required.
A. Whenever a department determines that a proposal is a nonexempt action for which appropriate environmental review has not been conducted or commenced, the department shall prepare or shall require the action proponent to prepare and submit an environmental checklist. Upon completion or receipt of a completed environmental checklist, the department shall immediately transmit the following to the responsible official or the responsible official’s designee:
    1. The original, signed copy of the environmental checklist; and
    2. A copy of any completed application form in the department’s possession relating to the proposal; and
    3. A copy of any project description, conceptual plan or plot plan which may have been prepared or submitted; and
    4. Any additional information in the department’s possession touching upon the environmental impacts of the proposed action.
B. The environmental review process shall begin when an environmental checklist application is received by the responsible official. Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant for completion as directed by the responsible official as provided in ACC Title 14. Checklist applications include the completed environmental checklist form together with any site plans, studies or other information needed to adequately review the application.
C. A department initiating a nonexempt city action may request that the responsible official or the responsible official’s designee assist the department in preparing the necessary environmental checklist.
D. The provisions of this section shall not apply when the responsible official and the proponent of a nonexempt action agree in writing that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts, and further agree that an environmental impact statement (EIS) will be prepared.
E. The responsible official may determine that the city will complete all or a part of an environmental checklist for a private proposal with its own staff, or may contract with one or more consultants to prepare or assist in preparation of a checklist, and may charge and collect fees from the applicant to cover costs incurred by the city in preparation of the checklist, if either of the following circumstances exist:
    1. The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the applicant; or
    2. The applicant has provided inaccurate or incomplete information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.
F. If fees are to be collected, the applicant shall be advised of the estimated costs, and shall be required to secure payment of such costs prior to the actual preparation of all or part of the environmental checklist. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.080 Environmental impact statement.
A. Whenever the responsible official has issued a determination of significance for a nonexempt action, it shall be the responsibility of the individual, corporation, agency or city department initiating or proposing the action to prepare a draft EIS and a final EIS under the supervision of the responsible official. The proposing individual, corporation, agency or department may contract with one or more consultants to prepare or assist in the preparation of an EIS, subject to the approval of the responsible official. Consultants shall be selected based on their expertise and knowledge related to the scoped environmental elements to be analyzed in the EIS documents. Regardless of who is involved in the preparation of an EIS, it is the EIS of the city and the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter, with SEPA and with the SEPA rules before it is issued.
B. The responsible official may determine that the city will complete all or a part of an EIS for a private proposal with its own staff, or may contract with one or more consultants to prepare or assist in preparation of an EIS, and may charge and collect fees from the applicant to cover costs incurred by the city in preparation of the EIS, if one or more of the following circumstances exist:
    1. The city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the applicant;
    2. The applicant has provided inaccurate or incomplete information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration;
    3. The responsible official and the applicant agree that the city will be responsible for completing the EIS.
C. If fees are to be collected, the applicant shall be advised of estimated costs, and shall be required to secure payment of such costs prior to the actual preparation of the EIS.
D. Prior to the preparation of an EIS the applicant and the city shall enter into a written agreement that shall at a minimum contain who is to prepare the EIS, its estimated cost, and estimated time frame to complete the EIS process. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.090 Public notice.
A. Whenever public notice is required under the SEPA rules, the responsible official shall cause notice to be given in the following manner:
    1. By posting the subject property in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.27 ACC (site-specific proposals only).
B. Additional public notice may be provided for proposals having or potentially having unusually widespread, unique or significant adverse impacts, or for other proposals, at the discretion of the responsible official.
C. Where notice is required for a proposed action which has been proposed or initiated by a party other than the city or a city department, the cost of newspaper publication of such notice or notices shall be borne by the city with fees paid by the proponent or applicant. (Ord. 5811 § 4, 2003; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.100 Internal circulation of environmental documents.
Relevant environmental documents shall accompany proposals through existing city project review processes. The responsible official shall ensure that environmental documents are provided to decision makers in the following manner:
A. Where a nonelected city official is to make a final decision on a nonexempt action, the responsible official shall provide that deciding official with a copy of a determination of nonsignificance (DNS) or a final EIS upon issuance of the DNS or FEIS.
B. Where the planning commission or hearing examiner is to make a recommendation on a nonexempt action, the responsible official shall transmit to the advisory body a copy of one of the following:
    1. Environmental checklist;
    2. Determination of nonsignificance (DNS);
    3. Draft environmental impact statement (DEIS);
    4. Final environmental impact statement (FEIS).
Transmittal of the appropriate environmental document shall either precede or accompany transmittal of a staff report or staff recommendation on the proposal.
C. A final staff recommendation to the hearing examiner or city council on a nonexempt major action should normally be preceded by, or accompanied by, either a final DNS or an FEIS. (Ord. 6186 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.110 Timing of decision on nonexempt action.
A. For nonexempt actions, the procedural requirements of SEPA, the SEPA rules and this chapter shall be completed prior to the city’s issuance of a license, permit or other approval, prior to the city committing to a particular course of action, or prior to the city making a decision that would either have adverse environmental impacts or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.
B. A final decision on a nonexempt action for which a DNS has been issued or EIS has been required shall not be made until after expiration of the environmental appeal period if not appealed or, if appealed, shall not be made until the decision on the appeal becomes final. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.120 Authority to condition or deny proposals.
A. The policies and goals set forth in and referenced by this chapter are supplementary to those in the existing authorization of the city.
B. The city may attach conditions to a permit or approval for a proposal so long as:
    1. Such conditions are necessary to mitigate probable significant adverse environmental impacts identified in environmental documents prepared pursuant to this chapter; and
    2. Such conditions are in writing; and
    3. The mitigation measures included in such conditions are reasonable and capable of being accomplished; and
    4. The city has considered whether other local, state, or federal mitigation measures applicable to the proposal are sufficient to mitigate the identified impacts; and
    5. Such conditions are based on one or more policies, plans, rules or regulations designated in ACC 16.06.130 as a basis for the exercise of substantive SEPA authority under RCW 43.21C.060, and cited in writing in the license, permit, ordinance or other decision document.
C. The city may deny a permit or approval for a proposal on the basis of SEPA so long as:
    1. A finding is made that approving the proposal would result in probable significant adverse environmental impacts that are identified in a final EIS or final supplemental EIS prepared pursuant to this chapter; and
    2. A finding is made that there are no reasonable mitigation measures capable of being accomplished that are sufficient to make the identified impact nonsignificant; and
    3. The denial is based on one or more policies, plans, rules or regulations designated in ACC 16.06.130 as a basis for the exercise of substantive SEPA authority under RCW 43.21C.060, and cited in writing in the license, permit, ordinance or other decision document.
D. If the lead agency determines, after the initial review of a project, that a proposed action could not comply with adopted plans, policies, rules or regulations, and where the city has authority other than SEPA to deny the proposal, the project can be denied outright without making a threshold determination, and shall be cited in writing. Proposed actions which are subsequently modified, amended or deemed to be consistent with adopted plans, policies, rules or regulations shall not receive final approval until the proposed action is in full compliance with SEPA, the SEPA rules and this chapter.
E. Where the responsible official has issued a mitigated DNS, the decision maker shall not approve the associated proposal until:
    1. The proponent has modified the proposal, either through modification of plans and other application materials or through a separate written instrument attached to the application, such that the mitigating measures of the mitigated DNS become part of the proposal; or
    2. The decision maker has incorporated the mitigating measures of the mitigated DNS into the license, permit, ordinance or other approval, through conditions attached pursuant to this chapter; or
    3. A combination of subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection.
F. Where mitigating measures are agreed to under subsection (E)(1) of this section, or imposed under subsection (E)(2) of this section, and where the proponent fails to implement such mitigating measures, the city shall have the authority to revoke any permit, license or other approval granted on the basis of such mitigating measures. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.130 Substantive authority.
The city adopts by reference the following policies, plans, rules and regulations, as may be amended, as a basis for the exercise of substantive authority to approve, condition or deny proposed actions under RCW 43.21C.060 of SEPA:
A. Auburn comprehensive plan and related reports and studies outlined in Appendix B;
B. Shoreline management master program;
C. Auburn City Code;
D. Auburn downtown plan;
E. Auburn capital improvements plan;
F. Six-year street plan;
G. Auburn Municipal Airport master plan;
H. Energy management plan. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.200 City responsibilities as consulted agency.
In carrying out the city’s duties as a consulted agency, the responsible official shall request information from any department potentially affected by or having expertise on a proposal. Information timely received by the responsible official in response to such request shall be transmitted to the lead agency. The responsible official may transmit such information by forwarding copies of any department responses or by consolidating all department responses into a single city response. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996.)

16.06.210 Use of non-SEPA documents.
A. If determined by the responsible official, existing plans, regulations, rules, or other laws that provide a functionally equivalent analysis of the specific adverse impacts of a proposed project that has already occurred and is available or will occur before action is taken on a proposed project may be used to forego the environmental analysis required under this title.

(Ord. 6235 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6095 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5811 § 5, 2003; Ord. 5170 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4225 § 1, 1987; Ord. 4047 § 73, 1985; 1957 code § 11.94.040(b).)

16.08.051 Statement of exemption.
Where development proposals in shoreline jurisdiction are subject to review, approval, and permitting by a federal or state agency, the director shall prepare a statement of exemption, addressed to the applicant, the federal or state permitting agency, and the Department of Ecology. The letter shall indicate the specific exemption provision from WAC 173-27-040 that is being applied to the development and provide a summary of the analysis demonstrating consistency of the project with the Auburn SMP and the SMA. (Ord. 6235 § 1, 2009.)

16.08.052 Application – Shoreline substantial development permit – Review criteria.
A. A substantial development permit shall be granted by the director only when the development proposed is consistent with the following:
    1. Goals, objectives, policies and use regulations of the Auburn SMP;
    2. Auburn Comprehensive Plan and Municipal Code; and
    3. The policies, guidelines, and regulations of the SMA (Chapter 90.58 RCW; Chapters 173-26 and 173-27 WAC).
B. The director may attach conditions to the approval of permits as necessary to assure consistency of the proposal with the above criteria. (Ord. 6235 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6095 § 1, 2008.)

16.08.054 Application – Shoreline conditional use permit – Review criteria.
A. Pursuant to WAC 173-27-210, the criteria below shall constitute the minimum criteria for review and approval of a shoreline conditional use permit. Uses classified as conditional uses, and not uses prohibited by the regulations of this SMP, may be authorized; provided, that the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:
    1. That the proposed use will be consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020, the policies of this SMP, the city of Auburn comprehensive plan and other applicable plans, programs and/or regulations;
    2. That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use or access to public shorelines;
    3. That the proposed use of the site and design of the project will be compatible with other permitted uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and shoreline master program;
    4. That the proposed use will cause no unreasonably adverse effects to the shoreline, will not result in a net loss of ecological functions, and will not be incompatible with the environment designation or zoning classification in which it is to be located;
    5. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect;
    6. That the proposed use is in the best interest of the public health, safety, morals or welfare; and
    7. That consideration of cumulative impacts resultant from the proposed use has occurred and has demonstrated that no substantial cumulative impacts are anticipated, consistent with WAC 173-27-160(4).
B. The director may attach conditions to the approval of permits as necessary to assure consistency of the proposal with the above criteria.
C. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be the final decision of the city. The Department of Ecology shall be the final authority authorizing a shoreline conditional use permit consistent with WAC 173-27-200. (Ord. 6235 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6095 § 1, 2008.)

16.08.056 Application – Shoreline variance – Review criteria.
A. The purpose of a variance permit is strictly limited to granting relief from specific bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in this SMP, and where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the physical character or configuration of property such that the strict implementation of the SMP would impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the SMA policies as stated in RCW 90.58.020. Requests for allowing uses different than those specifically identified as allowed in the shoreline environment cannot be considered in the variance process, but shall be considered through the conditional use process in ACC 16.08.080.
B. Pursuant to WAC 173-27-210, the criteria below shall constitute the minimum criteria for review and approval of a shoreline variance permit. Variance permits for development that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark (per RCW 90.58.030(2)(b) definition), except those areas designated as marshes, bogs or swamps pursuant to Chapter 173-22 WAC, may be authorized, provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:
    1. That the strict requirements of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the master program preclude or significantly interfere with a reasonable use of the property not otherwise prohibited by this SMP;
    2. That the hardship described above is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant’s own actions;
    3. That the design of the project will be compatible with other permitted activities within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and shoreline master program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment;
    4. That the variance authorized does not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by other properties in the area, and will be the minimum necessary to afford relief; and
    5. That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect;
    6. Variance permits for development that will be located either waterward of the ordinary high water mark or within marshes, bogs or swamps as designated in Chapter 173-22 WAC, may be authorized, provided the applicant can demonstrate all the criteria stated above as well as the following:
        a. That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in this SMP precludes all reasonable use of the property not otherwise prohibited by this SMP; and
        b. That the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected by the granting of the variance.
C. In the granting of all variance permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances should also remain consistent with the policies of Chapter 90.58 RCW and should not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment or result in a net loss of ecological functions.
D. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be the final decision of the city. The Department of Ecology shall be the final authority authorizing a shoreline variance consistent with WAC 173-27-200. (Ord. 6235 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6095 § 1, 2008.)

16.08.060 Application – Review criteria – Additional information.
A. The director shall review an application for a permit based on the following:
    1. The application;
    2. The environmental impact statement, if one has been prepared, or other environmental documents;
    3. Written comments from interested persons;
    4. Information and comments from other city departments affected and from the city attorney;
    5. Independent study of the planning department staff and evidence presented at the public hearing held pursuant to provisions of this chapter.
B. The director may require that an applicant furnish information in addition to the information required in the application forms prescribed. (Ord. 6235 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6095 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4225 § 1, 1987; 1957 code § 11.94.040(c).)

16.08.070 Development conformance burden of proof.
The burden of proving that the proposed development is consistent with the criteria set forth in this chapter and the master plan for the city shall be on the applicant, plus the requirements pursuant to Section 14(6) of the Act.

16.10.010 Purpose and intent.
A. The city of Auburn contains numerous areas that can be identified and characterized as critical or environmentally sensitive. Such areas within the city include wetlands, streams, wildlife habitat, significant trees, geologic hazards, ground water protection areas, and flood hazards.
B. The city finds that these critical areas perform a variety of valuable and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its residents. Alteration of certain critical areas may also pose a threat to public safety or to public and private property or the environment. The city therefore finds that identification, regulation and protection of critical areas are necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. The city further finds that the functions of critical areas and the purpose of these regulations include the following:
    1. Wetlands. Wetlands perform a variety of functions that include maintaining water quality; storing and conveying storm water and flood water; recharging ground water; providing important fish and wildlife habitat; and serve as areas for recreation, education and scientific study, and aesthetic appreciation.
    Wetland buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates; reduce sediment, chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants; provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures; provide habitat for wildlife; and protect wetland resources from harmful intrusion.
    The primary goals of wetland regulation are to avoid adverse effects to wetlands; to achieve no net loss of wetland function and value – acreage may also be considered in achieving the overall goal; to provide levels of protection that reflect the sensitivity of individual wetlands and the intensity of proposed land uses; and to restore and/or enhance existing wetlands, where possible.
    2. Streams. Streams and their associated riparian corridors provide important fish and wildlife habitat; help to maintain water quality; store and convey storm water and flood water; recharge ground water; and serve as areas for recreation, education and scientific study and aesthetic appreciation. Stream buffers serve to moderate runoff volume and flow rates; reduce sediment, chemical nutrient and toxic pollutants; provide shading to maintain desirable water temperatures; provide habitat for wildlife; and protect stream resources from harmful intrusion.
    The primary goals of stream regulation are to avoid adverse effects to streams and associated riparian corridors; to achieve no net loss of functions and values of the larger ecosystem in which the stream is located; to protect fish and wildlife resources; to protect water quality through appropriate management techniques; and, where possible, to provide for stream enhancement and rehabilitation.
    3. Wildlife Habitat. Wildlife habitat provides opportunities for food, cover, nesting, breeding and movement for fish and wildlife; maintains and promotes diversity of species and habitat; coordinates habitat protection with elements of the open space system; helps to maintain air and water quality; helps control erosion; serves as areas for recreation, education, scientific study, and aesthetic appreciation; and provides neighborhood separation and visual diversity within urban areas.
    The primary goals of wildlife habitat regulation are to avoid adverse effects to critical habitats for fish and wildlife; to achieve no net loss of functions and values of the larger ecosystem in which the wildlife habitat is located; to implement the goals of the Endangered Species Act; to promote connectivity between habitat areas to allow for wildlife movement; to provide multi-purpose open space corridors; and where possible to provide for fish and wildlife habitat enhancement and rehabilitation that reflect the sensitivity of the species.
    4. Ground Water Protection Areas. Ground water protection areas provide a source of potable water and contribute to stream discharge/flow. Such areas contribute to the recharge of aquifers, springs and/or wells and are susceptible to contamination of water supplies through infiltration of pollutants through the soil.
    The primary goals of ground water protection regulations are to protect ground water quality by maintaining the quantity of recharge; avoiding or limiting land use activities that pose potential risk of aquifer contamination; and to minimize or avoid adverse effects to ground water protection areas through the application of performance standards, and to comply with the requirements of the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and Washington Administrative Code that require Group A public water systems to develop and implement a wellhead protection program.
    5. Geologic Hazard Areas. Geologic hazard areas include lands or areas characterized by geologic, hydrologic and topographic conditions that render them susceptible to varying degrees of risk of landslides, erosion, seismic or volcanic activity.
    The primary goals of regulating geologic hazards are to avoid and minimize potential impacts to life and property by regulating and/or limiting land uses where necessary, and to conduct appropriate levels of analysis and ensure sound engineering and construction practices to address identified hazards.
    6. Flood Hazard Areas. Floodplains help to store and convey storm water and flood water; recharge ground water; provide important areas for riparian habitat; and serve as areas for recreation, education, and scientific study. Development within floodplain areas can be hazardous to those inhabiting such development, and to those living upstream and downstream. Floods also cause substantial damage to public and private property that results in significant costs to the public and individuals.
    The primary goals of flood hazard regulations are to limit or condition development within the regulatory floodplain to avoid substantial risk of damage to public and private property and that results in significant costs to the public and individuals; to avoid significant increases in peak storm water flows or loss of flood storage capacity; to protect critical habitat for fish and wildlife, and to meet the purposes set forth in Chapter 15.68 ACC. Requirements for the identification, assessment, alteration, and mitigation of flood hazard areas are contained in Chapter 15.68 ACC.
C. This chapter of the Auburn City Code and other sections as incorporated by reference contain standards, procedures, criteria and requirements intended to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential impacts to the city’s critical areas, and to enhance and restore degraded resources where possible. The general intent of these regulations is to avoid impacts to critical areas. In appropriate circumstances, impacts to specified critical areas resulting from regulated activities may be minimized, rectified, reduced and/or compensated for, consistent with the requirements of this chapter.
D. It is the further intent of this chapter to:
    1. Comply with the requirements of the Growth Management Act (Chapter 36.70A RCW) and implement rules to identify and protect critical areas and to perform the review of development regulations required by RCW 36.70A.215;
    2. Develop and implement a comprehensive, balanced and fair regulatory program that avoids impacts to critical resources where possible, that requires that mitigation be performed by those affecting critical areas, and that thereby protects the public from injury, loss of life, property or financial losses due to flooding, erosion, landslide, seismic events, soil subsidence, or steep slope failure;
    3. Implement the goals and policies of the Auburn comprehensive plan, including those pertaining to natural features and environmental protection, as well as goals relating to land use, housing, economic development, transportation, and adequate public facilities;
    4. Serve as a basis for exercise of the city’s substantive authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and the city’s environmental review procedures, where necessary to supplement these regulations, while also reducing the city’s reliance on project-level SEPA review;
    5. Provide consistent standards, criteria and procedures that will enable the city to effectively manage and protect critical areas while accommodating the rights of property owners to use their property in a reasonable manner;
    6. Provide greater certainty to property owners regarding uses and activities that are permitted, prohibited, and/or regulated due to the presence of critical areas;
    7. Coordinate environmental review and permitting of proposals involving critical areas with existing development review and approval processes to avoid duplication and delay pursuant to the Regulatory Reform Act, Chapter 36.70B RCW;
    8. Establish conservation and protection measures for threatened and endangered fish species in compliance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and the Growth Management Act requirements to preserve or enhance anadromous fisheries, WAC 365-195-925;
    9. Alert members of the public, including appraisers, assessors, owners, potential buyers or lessees, to the development limitations of critical areas and their required buffers.
E. Best Available Science. The city has considered and included the best available science in developing these regulations, consistent with RCW 36.70A.172 and WAC 365-195-900, et seq. This has been achieved through research and identification of relevant technical sources of information, consultation with experts in the disciplines covered by this chapter, and consultation and requests for technical information regarding best available science from state and federal resource agencies.
Preparation of this chapter has included the use of relevant nonscientific information, including consideration of legal, social, policy, economic, and land use issues. This reflects the city’s responsibilities under numerous laws and programs, including other provisions of the Growth Management Act, and the need to weigh and balance various factors as part of decision making to accomplish municipal objectives. This may result in some risk to the functions and values of some critical areas. The city will also use its authority under the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) to identify, consider and mitigate, where appropriate, significant adverse effects on critical resources not otherwise addressed by the regulations of this chapter.
The city intends to review and monitor implementation of its critical areas regulations and to use an adaptive management approach. It will make adjustments to the regulations, as appropriate, in response to changing conditions, new information about best available science, or empirical data indicating the effectiveness of its regulatory program. This will occur in the context of the city’s ongoing review and revision of its comprehensive plan and development regulations pursuant to the Growth Management Act.
Additional information, both scientific and nonscientific, regarding compliance with WAC 365-195-915(c), including identification of risks to resources, is contained in the findings and conclusions and the overall record supporting adoption of Auburn’s critical areas regulations. (Ord. 6295 § 3, 2010; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

E. An established use or existing structure that was lawfully permitted prior to May 13, 2005, but which is not in compliance with this chapter, shall be deemed a nonconforming use as defined in ACC 18.04.650. Unless otherwise provided for, existing structures, which intrude into critical areas buffers, shall not be reconstructed in such a manner that results in the further intrusion into the buffer area. Structures or developments that are nonconforming solely due to being contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall not be subject to the nonconforming use provisions of Chapter 18.54 ACC. (Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.050 Critical areas maps.
Maps have been developed by the city that show the general location of critical areas. These maps are available for reference at the city planning and development department. These maps shall be used for informational purposes as a general guide only for the assistance of property owners and other interested parties; the boundaries and locations shown are generalized. The actual presence or absence, type, extent, boundaries and classification of critical areas on a specific site shall be identified in the field by a qualified consultant and determined by the city, according to the procedures, definitions and criteria established by this chapter. In the event of any conflict between the critical area location or designation shown on the city’s maps and the criteria or standards of this section, the criteria and standards shall prevail. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.060 Relationship to other regulations.
A. These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay and in addition to zoning, land use and other regulations established by the city of Auburn. In the event of any conflict between these regulations and any other regulations of the city, the regulations which provide greater protection to critical areas shall apply.
B. Areas characterized by particular critical areas may also be subject to other regulations established by this chapter due to the overlap or multiple functions of some sensitive or critical areas. Wetlands, for example, may be defined and regulated according to the wetland, habitat and stream management provisions of this chapter. In the event of any conflict between overlapping regulations for multiple critical areas on the same site, the regulations which provide greater protection to critical areas shall apply. (Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.070 Critical area review process and application requirements.
A. Pre-Application Conference. A pre-application conference is available and encouraged prior to submitting an application for a project permit.
B. Application Requirements. 
    1. Timing of Submittals. Concurrent with submittal of a State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) checklist, or concurrent with submittal of an application for projects exempt from SEPA, a critical area report must be submitted to the city for review when the city believes that a critical area may be present. The purpose of the report is to determine the extent, characteristics and functions of any critical areas located on or potentially affected by activities on a site where regulated activities are proposed. The report will also be used by the city to determine the appropriate critical area classification and, if applicable, to establish appropriate buffer requirements.
    2. Report Contents. Reports and studies required to be submitted by this chapter shall contain, at a minimum, the information indicated in the provisions of this chapter applicable to each critical area. The director may tailor the information required to reflect the complexity of the proposal and the sensitivity of critical areas that may potentially be present.
C. Consultant Qualifications and City Review. All reports and studies required of the applicant by this section shall be prepared by a qualified consultant as that term is defined in these regulations. The city may retain a qualified consultant paid for by the applicant to review and confirm the applicant’s reports, studies and plans if the following circumstances exist:
    1. The city has technical information that is unavailable to the applicant; or
    2. The applicant has provided inaccurate or incomplete information on previous proposals or proposals currently under consideration.
D. Review Process. This section is not intended to create a separate critical area review permit for development proposals. To the extent possible, the city shall consolidate and integrate the review and processing of critical area-related aspects of proposals with other land use and environmental considerations and approvals. Any permits required by separate codes or regulations, such as floodplain development permits or shoreline substantial development permits, shall continue to be required. (Ord. 6295 § 4, 2010; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.080 Classification and rating of critical areas.
A. To promote consistent application of the standards and requirements of this chapter, critical areas within the city of Auburn shall be rated or classified according to their characteristics, function and value, and/or their sensitivity to disturbance.
B. Classification of critical areas shall be determined by the director based on consideration of the following factors and in the following order:
    1. Consideration of the technical reports submitted by qualified consultants in connection with applications subject to these regulations;
    2. Application of the criteria contained in these regulations; and
    3. Critical areas maps maintained by the planning and development department.
C. Wetland Classification. Wetlands shall be designated Category I, Category II, Category III, Category IV and as artificially created according to the criteria in this section. Wetland classifications incorporate the Washington State Wetlands Rating System for Western Washington (Department of Ecology, 2004, Publication No. 04-06-025). Wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the rating system by the local government, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland rating categories shall not change due to illegal modifications.
    1. “Category I wetlands” are those wetlands which meet any of the following criteria:
        a. Represent a unique or rare wetland type; or
        b. Are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or
        c. Are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or
        d. Are providing a high level of functions, scoring 70 points or more out of 100 (DOE Wetlands Rating System, 2004); or
        e. Are characterized as a national heritage wetland; or
        f. Are characterized as a bog; or
        g. Are over one acre and characterized as a mature and old-growth forested wetland.
    2. “Category II wetlands” are those wetlands which are not Category I wetlands and which meet any of the following criteria:
        a. Provide high levels of some functions, being difficult, though not impossible to replace; or
        b. Perform most functions relatively well, scoring 51 – 69 out of 100 points (DOE Wetlands Rating System, 2004).
    3. “Category III wetlands” are those wetlands that are not Category I or II wetlands, and which meet the following criterion:
        a. Provide moderate levels of functions, scoring between 30 – 50 out of 100 points (DOE Wetlands Rating System, 2004).
    4. “Category IV wetlands” are those wetlands that meet the following criterion:
        a. Provide low levels of functions, scoring less than 30 out of 100 points (DOE Wetlands Rating System, 2004).
    5. “Artificially created wetlands” are purposefully created landscape features, ponds and storm water detention or retention facilities. Artificially created wetlands do not include wetlands created as mitigation, and wetlands modified for approved land use activities. Purposeful creation must be demonstrated to the director through documentation, photographs, statements and/or other evidence. Artificial wetlands intentionally created from nonwetland sites are excluded from regulation under this section.
D. Stream Classification. Streams shall be designated Class I, Class II, Class III and Class IV according to the criteria in this section:
    1. “Class I streams” are those natural streams identified as “shorelines of the state” under the city of Auburn shoreline master program.
    2. “Class II streams” are those natural streams that are not Class I streams and are either perennial or intermittent and have one of the following characteristics:
        a. Contain fish habitat; or
        b. Has significant recreational value, as determined by the director.
    3. “Class III streams” are those natural streams with perennial (year-round) or intermittent flow and do not contain fish habitat.
    4. “Class IV streams” are those natural streams and drainage swales with channel width less than two feet taken at the ordinary high water mark, that do not contain fish habitat.
    5. “Intentionally created streams” are those manmade streams defined as such in these regulations, and do not include streams created as mitigation. Purposeful creation must be demonstrated through documentation, photographs, statements and/or other evidence. Intentionally created streams may include irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales and canals. Intentionally created streams are excluded from regulation under this section, except manmade streams that provide “critical habitat,” as designated by federal or state agencies, for salmonids.
E. Wildlife Habitat Classification. Wildlife habitat areas shall be classified as critical, secondary or tertiary according to the criteria in this section:
    1. “Critical habitat” are those habitat areas which meet any of the following criteria:
        a. The documented presence of species or habitat listed by federal or state agencies as “endangered,” “threatened,” or “sensitive”; or
        b. The presence of unusual nesting or resting sites such as heron rookeries;
        c. Category I wetlands, as defined in these regulations; or
        d. Class I streams, as defined in these regulations.
    2. “Secondary habitat” is habitat which is valuable to fish and wildlife and supports a wide variety of species due to its undisturbed nature, a diversity of plant species and structure, presence of water, or the area’s size, location, or seasonal importance.
    3. “Tertiary habitat” is habitat which is not classified as critical or secondary. It is habitat which, while supporting some wildlife and performing other valuable functions, does not currently possess essential characteristics necessary to support diverse wildlife communities. Tertiary habitat also includes habitat which has been created purposefully by human actions to serve other or multiple purposes, such as open space areas, landscape amenities, and detention facilities.
F. Ground Water Protection Areas. Ground water protection areas in this chapter correspond to water resource protection areas, which are described in the “Water Resource Protection Report” prepared for the city by Pacific Groundwater Group, December 2000. Water resource protection areas are based on time-related “capture zones” also referred to as “time-of-travel zones” which are derived using a numerical ground water flow model developed for the city and upon geologic conditions. A capture zone is the area that supplies ground water recharge to a pumping well or a spring. A time-related capture zone is the area that supplies ground water recharge to a pumping well or spring within a specified period of time. The location of ground water protection areas have been revised to include all of a parcel where capture zones include a portion of the parcel.
Ground water protection areas have been divided into four zones as follows:
    1. “Ground water protection zone 1” represents the land area overlying the one-year time-of-travel zone of any well or spring owned by the city.
    2. “Ground water protection zone 2” represents the land area in the central part of the city beneath which the principal aquifer used by the city for water supply is overlain by highly permeable sand and gravel deposits. These geologic conditions provide a direct pathway for contaminants that may be released to the soil to reach the aquifer.
    3. “Ground water protection zone 3” represents the land area overlying the region between the one-year and 10-year time-of-travel zone of any well or spring owned by the city.
    4. “Ground water protection zone 4” represents the land area within the city limits not designated as water resource protection zones 1, 2 or 3.
G. Geologic Hazard Classifications. Geologic hazard areas shall be classified according to the criteria in this section:
    1. Critical Erosion Hazard Areas. Critical erosion hazard areas are lands or areas underlain by soils identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service (SCS), now known as the Natural Resource Conservation Service, as having “severe” or “very severe” erosion hazards. This includes the following group of soils when they occur on slopes of 15 percent or greater: Alderwood-Kitsap (AkF), Alderwood gravelly sandy loam (AgD), Kitsap silt loam (KpD), Everett (EvD), and Indianola (InD).
    2. Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are classified as Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class IV as follows:
        a. Class I/Low Hazard. Areas with slopes of 15 percent or less.
        b. Class II/Moderate Hazard. Areas with slopes of between 15 percent and 40 percent and that are underlain by soils that consist largely of sand, gravel, or glacial till.
        c. Class III/High Hazard. Areas with slopes between 15 percent and 40 percent that are underlain by soils consisting largely of silt and clay.
        d. Class IV/Very High Hazard. Areas with slopes steeper than 15 percent with mappable zones of emergent water (e.g., springs or ground water seepage), areas of known (mappable) landslide deposits regardless of slope, and all areas with slopes 40 percent or greater.
    3. Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are lands that, due to a combination of soil and ground water conditions, are subject to severe risk of ground shaking, subsidence, or liquefaction of soils during earthquakes. These areas are typically underlain by soft or loose saturated soils (such as alluvium), have a shallow ground water table and are typically located on the floor of river valleys. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.090 Buffer areas and setbacks.
A. General Provisions. The establishment of on-site buffers, buffer areas or setbacks shall be required for all development proposals and activities in or adjacent to critical areas. The purpose of the buffer shall be to protect the integrity, function, value, and resources of the subject critical area (in the case of wetlands, streams, and/or wildlife habitat areas), and/or to protect life, property and resources from risks associated with development on unstable or critical lands (in the case of geologic hazard areas). Buffers shall typically consist of an undisturbed area of native vegetation retained or established to achieve the purpose of the buffer. No buildings or structures shall be allowed within the buffer unless as otherwise permitted by this section. If the site has previously been disturbed, the buffer area shall be revegetated pursuant to an approved enhancement plan. Buffers shall be protected during construction by placement of a temporary barricade, notice of the presence of the critical area and implementation of appropriate erosion and sedimentation controls. Restrictive covenants or conservation easements may be required to provide long-term preservation and protection of buffer areas.
B. Required buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the particular critical area and resource or the risks associated with development and, in those circumstances permitted by these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity proposed to be conducted on or near the critical area.
C. Buffers shall be measured as follows:
    1. Wetland buffers – the buffer shall be measured perpendicular from the wetland edge as delineated and marked in the field using the 1997 Washington State Wetlands Identification and Delineation Manual;
    2. Stream buffers – the buffer shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark;
    3. Geologic hazard area buffers shall be required for critical landslide hazard areas and shall be measured from the top and toe and along the sides of the slope.
D. Buffer Width Variances. A variance from buffer width requirements may be granted by the city subject to the variance criteria set forth in ACC 16.10.160. Minor variances, defined as up to and including 10 percent of the requirement, shall be considered by the director. Variance requests which exceed 10 percent shall be considered by the hearing examiner.
E. Buffer widths shall be established for specific critical areas according to the following standards and criteria:
    1. Wetland buffers shall be established as follows:
    +------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+
    | Wetland Category | Minimum Buffer Width |   Maximum Buffer Width    |
    |                  |                      | (see subsection (E)(1)(g) |
    |                  |                      |     of this section)      |
    +------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category I       | 100 feet             | 200 feet                  |
    +------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category II      | 50 feet              | 100 feet                  |
    +------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category III     | 25 feet              | 50 feet                   |
    +------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+
    | Category IV      | 25 feet              | 30 feet                   |
    +------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+
    Different buffer width requirements may apply to various portions of a site, without requiring averaging or variances, based on the site plan, the intensity of land uses in various locations, and differences in the category of wetland.
        a. Buffer width averaging may be allowed where the applicant demonstrates to the director that the wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing physical characteristics, that lower intensity land uses would be located adjacent to areas where buffer width is reduced, that width averaging will not adversely impact the wetland functional values and/or that the total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less in area than contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging. Buffer width averaging may be allowed only where such reduction shall not result in greater than a 35 percent reduction in the buffer width established in this section and the applicant demonstrates the following:
            i. The proposed buffer area is extensively vegetated and has less than 25 percent slopes, and the reduction will not result in adverse impacts to the wetland; or
            ii. The project includes a buffer enhancement plan, as part of the mitigation required by this chapter and has less than 25 percent slopes. The buffer enhancement plan shall use plant species which are native to the project area, and shall substantiate that an enhanced buffer will improve the functional attributes of the buffer to provide additional protection for wetland functional values; or
            iii. The acreage included in the buffer would substantially exceed the size of the wetland and the reduction will not result in adverse impacts to the wetland and the project includes a buffer enhancement plan which ensures that the reduction will not result in adverse impacts to the wetland.
        b. Buffer width may be reduced by up to 35 percent if an applicant undertakes measures approved by the director to enhance or restore the buffer. The restoration or enhancement may include, but is not limited to, planting of native trees or shrubs, increasing the diversity of plant cover types or replacement of exotic species with native species which approximate in composition a naturally occurring plant community.
        c. Application of subsections (E)(1)(a) and (b) of this section shall not result in a buffer width less than 25 feet.
        d. Certain uses and activities which are consistent with the purpose and function of the wetland buffer and do not detract from its integrity may be permitted by the director within the buffer depending on the sensitivity of the wetland. Examples of uses and activities with minimal impacts which may be permitted in appropriate cases include permeable pedestrian trails, viewing platforms, and utility easements; provided, that any impacts to the buffer resulting from such permitted activities shall be mitigated. Uses permitted within the buffer shall generally be located as far from the wetland as possible.
        e. Where existing buffers are degraded, the director may allow limited filling within the buffer when the applicant demonstrates that the buffer will be enhanced according to standards of this chapter, including appropriate soil preparation, will not result in slopes exceeding 25 percent, and there will be no net loss of wetland or buffer functions and values.
        f. Long-term protection of a regulated wetland and its associated buffer shall be provided by one of the following methods. It shall be placed in a separate tract on which development is prohibited, protected by execution of an easement dedicated to the city, a conservation organization or land trust, or similarly preserved through a permanent protective mechanism acceptable to the city. The location and limitations associated with the wetland and its buffer shall be shown on the face of the deed or plat applicable to the property and shall be recorded with the King or Pierce County recording department.
        g. The director may require increased buffer widths up to the amount in this column when a larger buffer is deemed necessary to protect wetland functions and values based on site conditions, site design, intensity and operational characteristics of the development/land use. Examples where increased buffers may be required include, but are not limited to, where a larger buffer is necessary to maintain viable populations of species listed as endangered, threatened or sensitive, or when land adjacent to the buffer is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures are inadequate to effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts.
    2. Stream buffers shall be established as follows:
    +--------------------------------------------+----------------+
    |                Stream Class                | Minimum Buffer |
    |                                            |     Width      |
    +--------------------------------------------+----------------+
    | Class I                                    | 100 feet       |
    | (see subsection (E)(2)(b) of this section) |                |
    +--------------------------------------------+----------------+
    | Class II                                   | 75 feet        |
    +--------------------------------------------+----------------+
    | Class III                                  | 25 feet        |
    +--------------------------------------------+----------------+
    | Class IV                                   | 25 feet        |
    +--------------------------------------------+----------------+
        a. The applicable minimum buffer for Class I streams shall be the larger of the buffer established by these regulations or that established by the city’s shoreline master program.
        b. The buffer widths required in this section may be increased by the director up to a maximum of 50 percent for Class I, II and IV streams and up to 100 percent for Class III streams in response to site-specific conditions and based on the report information submitted to characterize the functions and values of the stream. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where the critical area serves as habitat for threatened, endangered or sensitive species. The applicant may propose to implement one or more enhancement measures, listed in order of preference below, which will be considered in establishing buffer requirements:
            i. Removal of fish barriers to restore accessibility to anadromous fish.
            ii. Enhancement of fish habitat using log structures incorporated as part of a fish habitat enhancement plan.
            iii. Enhancement of wildlife habitat by adding structures that are likely to be used by wildlife, including wood duck houses, bat boxes, nesting platforms, snags, root wads/stumps, birdhouses, and heron nesting areas.
            iv. Additional mitigating measures may include but are not limited to:
                (A) Landscaping outside the buffer area with native vegetation or a reduction in the amount of clearing outside the buffer area;
                (B) Planting native vegetation within the buffer area, especially vegetation that would increase value for fish and wildlife, increase stream bank or slope stability, improve water quality, or provide aesthetic/recreational value;
                (C) Creating a surface channel where a stream was previously culverted or piped;
                (D) Removing or modifying existing stream culverts (such as at road crossings) to improve fish passage and flow capabilities which are not detrimental to fish;
                (E) Upgrading retention/detention facilities or other drainage facilities beyond required levels; or
                (F) Similar measures determined applicable by the director.
        c. No structures or improvements shall be permitted within the stream buffer area, including buildings, decks, docks, except as otherwise permitted or required under the city’s adopted shoreline master program, or under one of the following circumstances:
            i. When the improvements are part of an approved enhancement, restoration or mitigation plan; or
            ii. For construction of new public roads and utilities, and accessory structures, when no feasible alternative location exists; or
            iii. Construction of foot trails, according to the following criteria:
                (A) Designed to minimize impact of permeable materials;
                (B) Designed to minimize impact on the stream system;
                (C) Of a maximum width of 12 feet;
                (D) Located within the outer half of the buffer, i.e., the portion of the buffer that is farther away from the stream; or
            iv. Construction of footbridges; or
            v. Construction of educational facilities, such as viewing platforms and informational signs.
        d. Buffer width averaging may be allowed for Class II and Class III streams only; provided, that all of the following are demonstrated by the applicant:
            i. One or more of the enhancement measures identified in subsection (E)(2)(b)(i) through (iv) of this section is implemented;
            ii. The total area contained within the buffer after averaging is no less in area than contained within the standard buffer prior to averaging;
            iii. The buffer width averaging will result in stream functions and values equal or greater than before averaging; and
            iv. The buffer width is not reduced by more than 35 percent in any location than the buffer widths established by this chapter.
        e. Stream buffer widths may be reduced by the director on a case-by-case basis by up to 35 percent if an applicant demonstrates that a reduction will not result in any adverse impact to the stream. Further, if an existing buffer is vegetated, a buffer enhancement plan may be required to demonstrate how the function and values of the buffer and stream will be improved. If the existing buffer has been disturbed and/or is not vegetated, an enhancement plan shall be required that identifies measures to enhance the buffer functions and values and provide additional protection for the stream function and values. Enhancement plans are subject to approval by the planning director.
        f. Long-term protection of a regulated stream and its associated buffer shall be provided by one of the following methods, except for the portion of Class I streams which are owned by the State Department of Natural Resources. The stream and buffer shall be placed in a separate tract on which development is prohibited, protected by execution of an easement dedicated to the city, a conservation organization, land trust, or similarly preserved through a permanent protective mechanism acceptable to the city. The location and limitations associated with the stream and its buffer shall be shown on the face of the deed or plat applicable to the property and shall be recorded with the King or Pierce County recording department.
    3. Wildlife Habitat Areas. 
        a. Buffer widths for critical habitat areas shall be determined by the director based on consideration of the following factors: species recommendations of the Department of Fish and Wildlife; recommendations contained in the wildlife report and the nature and intensity of land uses and activities occurring on the site and on adjacent sites. Buffers shall not be required for secondary or tertiary habitat.
        b. Buffer widths for critical habitat areas may be modified by averaging buffer widths or by enhancing or restoring buffer quality.
        c. Certain uses and activities which are consistent with the purpose and function of the buffer for critical habitat areas and do not detract from its integrity may be permitted by the director within the buffer depending on the sensitivity of the habitat area. Examples of uses and activities with minimal impact which may be permitted in appropriate cases include permeable pedestrian trails and viewing platforms and utility easements; provided, that any impacts to the buffer resulting from permitted facilities shall be mitigated. When permitted, such facilities shall generally be located as far from the critical habitat area as possible.
        d. Long-term protection of critical habitat areas and their associated buffer(s) shall be provided by one of the following methods. The critical habitat area and buffer(s) shall be placed in a separate tract on which development is prohibited, protected by execution of an easement, dedicated to the city, a conservation organization, land trust, or similarly preserved through a permanent protective mechanism acceptable to the city. The location and limitations associated with the critical habitat area and its buffer(s) shall be shown on the face of the deed or plat applicable to the property and shall be recorded with the King or Pierce County recording department.
    4. Geologic Hazard Areas. 
        a. Required buffer widths for geologic hazard areas shall reflect the sensitivity of the geologic hazard area in question and the types and the risks associated with development and, in those circumstances permitted by these regulations, the type and intensity of human activity and site design proposed to be conducted on or near the area.
        b. Required buffers may vary in width. The widths of the buffer shall reflect the sensitivity of the geologic hazard area in question and the types and density of uses proposed on or adjacent to the geologic hazard. In determining the appropriate buffer width, the director shall consider the recommendations contained in any geologic hazards report required by these regulations and prepared by a qualified consultant.
        c. Buffers may be reduced to a minimum width of 15 feet when the applicant demonstrates through the geologic hazard report that the reduction will adequately protect the geologic hazard and the proposed development through use of proposed engineering techniques. (Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.100 Alteration or development of critical areas – Standards and criteria.
Alteration of specific critical areas and/or their buffers may be allowed by the director subject to the criteria of this section. Alteration shall implement the mitigation standards as identified in ACC 16.10.110, and the performance standards of ACC 16.10.120 and the monitoring requirements of ACC 16.10.130.

            ii. Culverts will include gradient controls and creation of pools within the culvert for Class II streams;
            iii. Gravel substrate will be placed in the bottom of the culvert to a minimum depth of one foot for Class II and Class III streams;
        d. The applicant or successors shall, at all times, keep any culvert free of debris and sediment to allow free passage of water and, if applicable, fish.
    4. The city may require that an existing culvert be removed from a stream as a condition of approval, unless the culvert is not detrimental to fish habitat or water quality, or removal would be a long-term detriment to fish or wildlife habitat or water quality.
C. Wildlife Habitat. 
    1. Critical Habitat. Alterations of critical habitat shall be avoided, subject to the reasonable use provisions of this chapter.
    2. Secondary Habitat. Alterations of secondary habitat may be permitted; provided, that the applicant mitigates adverse impacts consistent with the performance standards of ACC 16.10.120, and other requirements of this chapter.
    3. Tertiary Habitat. Alterations of tertiary habitat are permitted consistent with applicable provisions of these regulations and provided that no other regulated critical area is present.
D. Ground Water Protection Areas. Requests to establish the following land uses and activities applied for on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be prohibited in ground water protection zones 1, 2, and 3:
    1. Class V injection wells that inject industrial, municipal, or commercial waste fluids (as defined in WAC 173-218-030);
    2. Surface impoundments for treating, storing and disposing of dangerous waste (as defined in WAC 173-303-040 and 173-304-100);

    4. Hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal (as defined in WAC 173-303-040);
    5. All types of solid waste landfills (as defined in WAC 173-304-100);
    6. On-site sewage systems (as defined in WAC 246-272-01001) except as related to R-R, rural residential zoned properties;
    7. Recycling facilities that accept, store, or use hazardous materials;
    8. Underground storage of hazardous materials excluding the underground storage of petroleum and other regulated substances as regulated by Chapter 173-360 WAC;
    9. Use, storage, treatment, or production of perchlorethylene (PCE), other than in closed-loop systems that do not involve any discharge of PCE;
    10. Petroleum refining, reprocessing, and storage;
    11. Petroleum-product pipelines not associated with underground storage of petroleum and other regulated substances as regulated by Chapter 173-360 WAC; and
    12. Storage or distribution of gasoline treated with the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).
E. Geologic Hazard Areas. 
    1. General Standards. The city may approve, condition or deny proposals for the alteration of geologic hazard areas, as appropriate, based on the degree to which the significant risks posed by critical hazard areas to public and private property and to public health and safety can be mitigated. The objective of mitigation measures shall be to render a site containing a critical geologic hazard as safe as one not containing such hazard or one characterized by a low hazard. In appropriate cases, conditions may include limitations of proposed uses, modification of density, alteration of site layout and other appropriate changes to the proposal. Where potential impacts cannot be effectively mitigated or where the risk to public health, safety and welfare, public or private property, or important natural resources is significant notwithstanding mitigation, the proposal shall be denied.
    2. Specific Standards. 
        a. Class IV Landslide Hazard Areas. Alteration shall be prohibited subject to the reasonable use provisions of this chapter.
        b. Critical Seismic Hazard Areas. 
            i. For one-story and two-story residential structures, the applicant shall conduct an evaluation of site response and liquefaction potential based on the performance of similar structures under similar foundation conditions; or
            ii. For all other proposals, the applicant shall conduct an evaluation of site response and liquefaction potential including sufficient subsurface exploration to provide a site coefficient (S) for use in the static lateral force procedure described in the International Building Code.
        c. When development is permitted in geologic hazard areas by these regulations, an applicant and/or its qualified consultant shall provide assurances which, at the city’s discretion, may include one or more of the following:
            i. A letter from the geotechnical engineer and/or geologist who prepared the geologic hazard report required by these regulations, stating that the risk of damage from the proposal, both on-site and off-site, are minimal subject to the conditions set forth in the report, that the proposal will not increase the risk of occurrence of the potential geologic hazard, and that measures to eliminate or reduce risks have been incorporated into its recommendations;
            ii. A letter from the applicant, or the owner of the property if not the applicant, stating its understanding and acceptance of any risk of injury or damage associated with development of the site and agreeing to notify any future purchasers of the site, portions of the site, or structures located on the site of the geologic hazard;
            iii. A legally enforceable hold harmless agreement, which shall be recorded as a covenant and noted on the face of the deed or plat, and executed in a form satisfactory to the city, acknowledging that the site is located in a geologic hazard area; the risks associated with development of such site; and a waiver and release of any and all claims of the owner(s), their directors, employees, or successors, or assigns against the city of Auburn for any loss, damage, or injury, whether direct or indirect, arising out of issuance of development permits for the proposal; and
            iv. Posting of a bond, guarantee or other assurance device approved by the city to cover the cost of monitoring, maintenance and any necessary corrective actions.
F. Flood Hazard Areas. Development standards are defined by Chapter 15.68 ACC. (Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.110 Mitigation standards, criteria and plan requirements.
A. Mitigation Standards. Adverse impacts to critical area functions and values shall be mitigated. Mitigation actions shall generally be implemented in the preferred sequence identified in this chapter. Proposals which include less preferred and/or compensatory mitigation shall demonstrate that:
    1. All feasible and reasonable measures as determined by the department have been taken to reduce impacts and losses to the critical area, or to avoid impacts where avoidance is required by these regulations;
    2. The restored, created or enhanced critical area or buffer will be as viable and enduring as the critical area or buffer area it replaces; and
    3. No overall net loss will occur in wetland or stream functions and values. The mitigation shall be functionally equivalent to or greater than the altered wetland or stream in terms of hydrological, biological, physical, and chemical functions.
B. Location and Timing of Mitigation. 
    1. The preferred location of mitigation is on site when ecologically preferable to other identified alternatives. Mitigation may be allowed off site when it is determined by the department that on-site mitigation is not ecologically preferable to other identified alternatives, or, in the case of wetlands, where the affected site is identified as appropriate for off-site mitigation in the Mill Creek Special Area Management Plan (SAMP), April 2000. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that mitigation cannot be provided on site or is consistent with the SAMP. If it is determined that on-site mitigation is not ecologically preferable to other identified alternatives, mitigation shall be provided in the same drainage basin as the permitted activity on property owned, secured, or controlled by the applicant, or provided by the applicant using alternative mitigation options such as mitigation banking or in-lieu fee programs. The mitigation should result in no net loss to the critical area functions impacted and associated watershed. Where mitigation is authorized to be located outside the city limits, the applicant shall assure to the satisfaction of the department that other requirements of this chapter will be met, including but not limited to, monitoring and maintenance.
    2. In-kind mitigation shall be provided except when the applicant demonstrates, and the department concurs, that greater functional and habitat value can be achieved through out-of-kind mitigation.
    3. When wetland, stream or habitat mitigation is permitted by these regulations, the mitigation project shall occur near an adequate water supply (river, stream, ground water) with a hydrologic connection to the critical area to ensure a successful mitigation or restoration. A natural hydrologic connection is preferential as compared to one which relies upon manmade or constructed features requiring routine maintenance.
    4. Any mitigation plan shall be completed before initiation of other permitted activities, unless a phased or concurrent schedule that assures completion prior to occupancy has been approved by the department.
C. Wetland Replacement Ratios. 
    1. Where wetland alterations are permitted by the director, the applicant shall enhance or create areas of wetlands in order to compensate for wetland losses. The compensation shall be determined according to acreage, function, type, location, timing factors and projected success of enhancement or creation.
    2. The following acreage replacement and enhancement ratios shall be implemented; however, the department may vary these standards if the applicant can demonstrate and the director agrees that the variation will provide adequate compensation for lost wetland area, functions and values, or if other circumstances as determined by the director justify the variation. Except as provided for Category IV wetlands in subsection (C)(3) of this section, in no case shall the amount of mitigation be less than the area of affected wetland. The director may at his discretion increase these standards where mitigation is to occur off-site or in other appropriate circumstances.
    3. Category IV wetlands can be mitigated by either: (a) meeting one of the replacement ratios (*see following table); or (b) implementing mitigation which ensures no net loss of values and functions of the larger ecosystem in which the critical area is located.
    +------------------+----------------+---------------+---------------------+
    | Wetland Category | Wetland Creation Ratio (Acres) | Wetland Enhancement |
    |                  |                                |    Ratio (Acres)    |

16.10.120 Performance standards for mitigation planning.
The performance standards in this section shall be incorporated into mitigation plans submitted to the city for impacts to critical areas.
A. Wetlands and Streams. 
    1. Use plants native to the Puget Lowlands or Pacific Northwest ecoregion; non-native, introduced plants or plants listed by the Washington State Department of Agriculture as noxious weeds (Chapter 16-750 WAC) shall not be used;
    2. Use plants adapted to and appropriate for the proposed habitats and consider the ecological conditions known or expected to be present on the site. For example, plants assigned a facultative wetland (FACW) wetland indicator status should be used for sites with soils that are inundated or saturated for long periods during the growing season. Use nearby reference wetlands or aerial photos to identify plants suitable to the site conditions and hydrologic regimes planned for the mitigation site. Avoid planting significant areas of the site with species that have questionable potential for successful establishment, such as species with a narrow range of habitat tolerances;
    3. Utilize plant species’ heterogeneity and structural diversity that emulates native plant communities described in “Natural Vegetation of Oregon and Washington” (Franklin, J.F. and C.T. Dyrness, 1988) or other regionally recognized publications on native landscapes;
    4. Specify plants that are commercially available from native-plant nurseries or available from local sources. If collecting some or all native plants from donor sites, collect in accordance with ecologically accepted methods, such as those described in the “Washington Native Plant Society’s Policy on Collection and Sale of Native Plants,” that do not jeopardize the survival or integrity of donor plant populations;
    5. Use perennial plants in preference to annual species; the use of annuals species should be limited to a temporary basis in order to provide erosion control, support the establishment of perennial plants, or if mitigation monitoring determines that native plants are not naturally colonizing the site or if species diversity is unacceptably low compared to approved performance standards;
    6. Use plant species high in food and cover value for native fish and wildlife species that are known or likely to use the mitigation site (according to reference wetlands, published information, and professional judgment);
    7. Install a temporary irrigation system and specify an irrigation schedule unless a sufficient naturally-occurring source of water is demonstrated;
    8. Identify methods of soil preparation. For stream substrate or wetland soils, at least one foot of clean inorganic and/or organic materials, such as cobble, gravel, sand, silt, clay, muck, soil, or peat, as appropriate, shall be ensured. The stream substrate or wetland soils shall be free from solid, dangerous, or hazardous substance as defined by Chapter 70.105 RCW and implementing rules;
    9. Confine temporary stockpiling of soils to upland areas. Identify construction access routes and measures to avoid resultant soil compaction. Unless otherwise approved by the director, comply with all applicable best management practices for clearing, grading, and erosion control to protect any nearby surface waters from sediment and turbidity;
    10. Show densities and placement of plants; these should be based on the ecological tolerances of species proposed for planting, as determined by a qualified consultant;
    11. Provide sufficient specifications and instructions to ensure proper placement and spacing of seeds, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, springs, plugs and transplanted stock, and other habitat features, and to provide a high probability of success, and to reduce the likelihood of prolonged losses of wetland functions from proposed development;
    12. Do not rely on fertilizers and herbicides to promote establishment of plantings; if fertilizers are used, they must be applied per manufacturer specifications to planting holes in organic or controlled release forms, and never broadcast on the ground surface; if herbicides are used to control invasive species or noxious weeds and to help achieve performance standards, only those approved for use in aquatic ecosystems by the Washington Department of Ecology shall be used; herbicides shall only be used in conformance with all applicable laws and regulations and be applied per manufacturer specifications by an applicator licensed in the state of Washington; and
    13. Include the applicant’s mitigation plan consultant in the construction process to ensure the approved mitigation plan is completed as designed. At a minimum, the consultant’s participation will include site visits to inspect completed rough and final grading, installation of in-water or other habitat structures, and to verify the quality and quantity of native plant materials before and after installation;
    14. Signs and Fencing of Wetlands and Streams Critical Areas. 
        a. Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of the critical area or buffer and the limits of those areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization shall be marked in the field in such a way as to ensure that no unauthorized intrusion will occur, and verified by the department prior to the commencement of authorized activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction, and shall not be removed until permanent signs, if required, are in place.
        b. Permanent Signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the department may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of a critical area or buffer. Permanent signs shall be made of metal face and attached to a metal post, firmed anchored, or other materials of equal durability approved by the director. Signs must be posted at an interval of one per lot or every 50 feet, whichever is less, and must be maintained by the property owner in perpetuity. The sign shall be worded as follows or with alternative language approved by the director:“Habitat Conservation Area”
        Do Not Disturb

        c. Fencing. 
            i. The director shall condition any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter to require the application to install a permanent fence at the edge of the critical area or buffer, when fencing will prevent future impacts on the critical area.
            ii. The applicant shall be required to install a permanent fence around the critical area or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced on-site.
            iii. Fencing installed as part of a proposed activity or as required in this subsection shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes habitat impacts.
B. Wetlands. Do not exceed a maximum water depth of 6.6 feet (two meters) at mean low water unless approved as part of a planned interspersion of wetland vegetation classes and deep-water habitats.
    1. Do not exceed a slope of 25 percent (4H:1V) in the wetland unless it can be clearly demonstrated by supporting documentation that wetland hydrology and hydric soils capable of supporting hydrophytic (wetland) vegetation will be created on steeper slopes;
    2. Do not exceed a slope of 25 percent (4H:1V) in the wetland buffer; and
    3. Limit deep-water habitat (greater than 6.6 feet at mean low water) in compensatory wetland to no more than 60 percent of the total area, and approach this limit only when deep-water habitat is highly interspersed with wetland vegetation classes, including aquatic bed, emergent, scrub-shrub, and forested.
C. Wildlife Habitat Conservation Areas. 
    1. Incorporate relevant performance standards from subsections A and B of this section, as determined by the director;
    2. Include the following additional mitigation measures in mitigation planning:
        a. Locate buildings and structures in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts on critical habitats used by threatened or endangered species and identified by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
        b. Integrate retained habitat into open space and landscaping;
        c. Wherever possible, consolidate critical habitats into larger, unfragmented, contiguous blocks;
        d. Use native plant species for landscaping of disturbed or undeveloped areas and in any habitat enhancement or restoration activities;
        e. Create habitat heterogeneity and structural diversity that emulates native plant communities described in Natural Vegetation of Oregon and Washington (Franklin, J.F. and C.T. Dyrness, 1988) or other regionally recognized publications on native landscapes;
        f. Remove and/or control any noxious weeds or exotic animals which are problematic to the critical habitat area as determined by the director or consultant hired by the city to review the mitigation plan; and
        g. Preserve significant or existing native trees, preferably in stands or groups, consistent with achieving the goals and standards of this chapter; the plan shall reflect the report prepared pursuant to ACC 16.10.070.
D. Geologic Hazard Areas. 
    1. Incorporate relevant performance standards from the preceding subsections, as determined by the director;
    2. The following additional performance standards shall be reflected in proposals within geologic hazard areas:
        a. A geologic hazard report shall be prepared to identify and evaluate potential hazards and to formulate mitigation measures;
        b. Construction methods will not adversely affect geologic hazards or will reduce adverse impacts on geologic hazards;
        c. Site planning shall minimize disruption of existing topography and natural vegetation;
        d. Impervious surface coverage shall be minimized;
        e. Disturbed areas shall be replanted with permanent vegetation as soon as feasible pursuant to a mitigation or landscape plan;
        f. Clearing and grading shall be limited to between April 1st and October 31st unless the geologic hazard report specifically addresses measures necessary to perform clearing and grading during other portions of the year;
        g. The limited use of retaining walls that minimize disturbance or alteration of existing natural slope areas are preferred over graded slopes;
        h. Temporary erosion and sedimentation controls, pursuant to an approved plan, shall be implemented during construction;
        i. A drainage plan shall be prepared for large projects as required by the city engineer;
        j. Development shall not increase instability or create a hazard to the site or adjacent properties, or result in a significant increase in sedimentation or erosion.
E. Ground Water Protection Areas. A mitigation plan is required of all development except an individual single-family or two-family (duplex) dwelling unit. The mitigation plans shall include the following minimum measures and incorporate the appropriate responses.
    1. Ground Water Protection Zones 1, 2 and 3. 
        a. Indicate how hazardous materials shall be stored and used such that any unauthorized release or discharge of the hazardous materials is prevented.

        f. Include a provision that the mitigation plan will be kept up-to-date. Updates shall occur whenever there is a change in use or business occupancy or when there are significant changes in facility operations or hazardous materials management. A copy of the plan is to be available for review by city inspectors at the business or businesses within the development. The plan should cover the facility site in general as well as have a section(s) specific to any tenants within the development.
    2. Ground Water Protection Zone 4. Business owners shall implement best management practices for water resource protection. (Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.130 Monitoring program and contingency plan.
A. For all actions requiring a mitigation plan, a monitoring program shall be prepared and implemented by the applicant to evaluate the success of the mitigation project and to determine necessary corrective actions. This program shall determine if the original goals and objectives are being met. The monitoring program shall be reviewed and approved by the city prior to implementation. The monitoring program shall include a contingency plan in the event that implementation of the mitigation plan is inadequate or fails.
B. A performance and maintenance security is required to ensure the applicant’s compliance with the terms of the approved mitigation plan. The amount of the performance security shall equal 125 percent of the cost of the mitigation project for the length of the monitoring period; the director may agree to reduce the security in proportion to work successfully completed over the period of the security.
C. Incorporate the following into monitoring programs prepared to comply with this chapter:
    1. Appropriate, accepted, and unbiased qualitative or precise and accurate quantitative sampling methods to evaluate the success or failure of the project compared to performance standards approved by the city;
    2. Quantitative sampling methods that include permanent photopoints installed at the completion of construction and maintained throughout the monitoring period and shall also include permanent transects, sampling points (e.g., quadrants or water quality or quantity monitoring stations), and wildlife monitoring stations;
    3. Clearly stipulated qualitative and quantitative sampling methods that are approved by the city before implementation by the project proponent;
    4. Appropriate qualitative and/or quantitative performance standards that will be used to measure the success or failure of the mitigation. For wetlands, streams and habitat areas these will include, at a minimum, standards for plant survival and diversity, including structural diversity, the extent of wetland hydrology, hydric soils, and habitat types and requirements as appropriate; all proposed standards are subject to review and approval by the city or the consultant selected by the city to review the monitoring plan;
    5. Monitoring programs for a minimum period of three years for buffer enhancement and a minimum of five years for other types of mitigation programs that include, at a minimum, preparation of an as-built plan; biannual monitoring and preparation of annual monitoring reports following implementation; and a maintenance plan. More stringent monitoring requirements may be required on a case-by-case basis for more complex mitigation plans;
    6. Monitoring reports shall be submitted to the director by December 1st of the year in which monitoring is conducted. The reports are to be prepared by a qualified consultant and must contain all qualitative and quantitative monitoring data, photographs, and an evaluation of each of the applicable performance standards. If performance standards are not being met, appropriate corrective or contingency measures must be identified and communicated to the director and upon concurrence, implemented to ensure that performance standards will be met;
    7. Provision for the extension of the monitoring period beyond the minimum timeframe if performance standards are not being met at the end of the initial five-year period; and provision for additional financial securities or bonding to ensure that any additional monitoring and contingencies are completed to ensure the success of the mitigation. (Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.140 Procedural provisions.
A. Interpretation and Conflicts. The director shall have the authority to administer the provisions of this chapter, to make determinations with regard to the applicability of the regulations, to interpret the intent of unclear provisions, to require additional information, to determine the level of detail and appropriate methodologies for critical area reports and studies, to prepare application forms and informational materials as required, and to promulgate procedures and rules for unique circumstances not anticipated within standards and procedures contained in this section. Administrative interpretations may be appealed to the hearing examiner as prescribed in ACC 18.70.050.
B. Penalties and Enforcement. Compliance with these regulations and penalties for their violation shall be enforced pursuant to the procedures set forth in Chapter 1.25 ACC.

16.10.150 Reasonable use provision.
A. The standards and requirements of these regulations are not intended, and shall not be construed or applied in a manner, to deny all reasonable use of private property. If an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the hearing examiner that strict application of these standards would deny all reasonable use of a property, development may be permitted subject to appropriate conditions.
B. Applications for a reasonable use exception shall be processed as a Type III decision, pursuant to ACC 14.03.030 and Chapter 2.46 ACC.
C. An applicant for relief from strict application of these standards shall demonstrate that all of the following criteria are met:
    1. No reasonable use with less impact on the critical area and its buffer is possible.
    There is no feasible and reasonable on-site alternative to the activities proposed, considering possible changes in site layout, reductions in density and similar factors, that would allow a reasonable and economically viable use with fewer adverse impacts;
    2. The proposed activities, as conditioned, will result in the minimum possible impacts to affected critical areas;
    3. All reasonable mitigation measures have been implemented or assured;
    4. The inability to derive reasonable use is not the result of the applicant’s actions or that of a previous property owner, such as by segregating or dividing the property and creating an undevelopable condition; and
    5. The applicant shall demonstrate that the use would not cause a hazard to life, health or property.
D. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to provide evidence in support of the application and to provide sufficient information on which any decision has to be made.
E. Approval of a reasonable use exception shall not eliminate the need for any other permit or approval otherwise required for a proposal by applicable city codes.
F. Except when application of this title would deny all reasonable use of a site, an applicant who seeks an exception from the regulations of the title shall pursue a variance as provided in ACC 16.10.160. (Ord. 6442 § 13, 2012; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.160 Variances.
Applications for variances to the strict application of the terms of this chapter to a property may be submitted to the city. Minor variances, defined as up to and including 10 percent of the requirement, may be granted by the director as a Type II decision as defined by Chapter 14.03 ACC. Variance requests which exceed 10 percent may be granted by the hearing examiner as a Type III decision, pursuant to ACC 14.03.030 and Chapter 2.46 ACC. Approval of variances from the strict application of the critical area requirements shall conform to the following criteria:
A. There are unique physical conditions peculiar and inherent to the affected property which make it difficult or infeasible to strictly comply with the provisions of this section;
B. The variance is the minimum necessary to accommodate the building footprint and access;
C. The proposed variance would preserve the functions and values of the critical area, and/or the proposal does not create or increase a risk to the public health, safety and general welfare, or to public or private property;
D. The proposed variance would not adversely affect surrounding properties adjoining;
E. Adverse impacts to critical areas resulting from the proposal are minimized; and
F. The special circumstances or conditions affecting the property are not a result of the actions of the applicant or previous owner. (Ord. 6442 § 14, 2012; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

16.10.170 Special exception for public agencies and utilities.
A. If the application of this chapter would prohibit a development proposal by a public agency or public utility, the agency or utility may apply for an exception pursuant to this section.
B. Exception Request and Review Process. An application for a public agency and utility exception shall be made to the city and shall include a critical area identification form; critical area report, including mitigation plan, if necessary; and any other related project documents such as permit applications to other agencies, special studies, and environmental documents prepared pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (Chapter 43.21C RCW). The director shall prepare a recommendation to the hearing examiner based on review of the submitted information, a site inspection, and the proposal’s ability to comply with public agency and utility exception review criteria in subsection D of this section.
C. Hearing Examiner Review. The hearing examiner shall review the application and director’s recommendation, and conduct a public hearing pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 2.46 ACC. The hearing examiner shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request based on the proposal’s ability to comply with all of the public agency and utility exception criteria in subsection D of this section.
D. Public Agency and Utility Review Criteria. The criteria for review and approval of public agency and utility exceptions follow:
    1. There is no other practical alternative to the proposed development with less impact on critical areas;
    2. The application of this chapter would unreasonably restrict the ability to provide utility services to the public;
    3. The proposal does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare on or off the development proposal site;
    4. The proposal attempts to protect and mitigate impacts to the critical area functions and values consistent with other applicable regulations and standards.
E. Burden of Proof. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to bring forth evidence in support of the application and to provide sufficient information on which any decision has to be made on the application. (Ord. 6442 § 15, 2012; Ord. 5894 § 1, 2005.)

17.01.010 Introduction.
This title contains standards, regulations and processes for the division of land and adjustment of property boundaries within the city. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.020 What is a subdivision?
The process of dividing land into smaller lots is often generically referred to as a subdivision. However, in this title, the term “subdivision” refers specifically to the division of land into five or more lots, while the division of land into four or fewer lots is called a “short subdivision.” Most of the regulations for subdivisions and short subdivisions are the same, but a short subdivision is an administrative process where an application is reviewed and decided upon by city staff whereas a subdivision is reviewed and decided upon by the city’s hearing examiner. A plat is the drawing or map which shows the subdivision or short subdivision. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.030 How is a plat reviewed?
The plat review process for a short subdivision, including the infrastructure improvement requirements for approval, is set forth in Chapter 17.09 ACC. The plat review process for a subdivision, from the pre-application conference to preliminary approval by the hearing examiner, is set forth in Chapter 17.10 ACC. Chapter 17.16 ACC includes additional requirements for planning and other studies to be submitted for review along with the preliminary plat. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.040 What are the criteria for approval?
A plat must be laid out in accordance with the standards and specifications set forth in Chapter 17.14 ACC. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.050 What happens after a plat is approved?
Once the layout of a subdivision has been approved by the city, it is said to have preliminary approval. Then the applicant must submit construction drawings of the infrastructure that was proposed in the preliminary plat. Once these construction drawings are approved by the city and the infrastructure has been built, inspected and accepted by the city, the plat has final approval and can be recorded with the appropriate county. In the case of a subdivision, an additional application, review and approval process is required for this final approval. This final plat process is set forth in Chapter 17.12 ACC. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.060 What about a simple boundary line adjustment or elimination?
Other land adjustment tools are also outlined in this title, including boundary line adjustments (Chapter 17.06 ACC) and boundary line eliminations (Chapter 17.08 ACC). Boundary line adjustments are the movement of a boundary line that does not result in the creation of a new lot. Boundary line eliminations are the merging of two or more lots by eliminating one or more lot lines. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.070 How do you modify an existing subdivision?
The applicant can request a modification of subdivision standards and specifications through the process set forth in Chapter 17.18 ACC. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.080 How do you change a recorded subdivision?
After a subdivision has been recorded with the county in which it is located, any proposed change to the subdivision is called a subdivision alteration. The alteration process is set forth in Chapter 17.20 ACC. If the applicant proposes to make a change to an approved preliminary plat before final plat approval and recording, then the applicant may request an adjustment to the preliminary plat through the process set forth in ACC 17.10.100. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.090 How do you eliminate a recorded subdivision?
A plat may also be vacated, or eliminated, after recording. Chapter 17.22 ACC outlines the process by which a plat may be vacated, and to whom the title to the vacated property shall vest. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.100 Is there another process by which you can subdivide land?
The binding site plan process is an alternative form of land division. It may be used for the division of land for commercially or industrially zoned property, or for certain types of residential development. This process is set forth in Chapter 17.24 ACC. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

17.01.110 Can you cluster lots within a subdivision?
The city of Auburn allows clustering of lots within a subdivision onto a portion of the site, while maintaining the density of the residential zone. Clustering allows future development to occur at an appropriate density for infrastructure services; it also protects environmentally sensitive areas or cultural/historic features by clustering lots away from these areas. The standards by which clustering is allowed are set forth in Chapter 17.26 ACC. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

This provision does not apply to lots set aside from development and preserved as open space.
E. Adjacent Streets. When any public street lying adjacent to the property being short subdivided has insufficient width or for any other reason does not conform to minimum street standards, in accordance with the city design and construction standards, sufficient additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to the city and appropriate improvements shall be made by the subdivider to conform the abutting half of the street to such standards consistent with Chapter 12.64A ACC.

    1. The general alignment of a proposed private street, access easement or panhandle follows the general alignment of a future arterial as shown in the comprehensive plan; or
    2. The general alignment of a proposed private street, access easement or panhandle can be reasonably modified to provide a desirable through-connection between two or more existing or planned public streets or arterials; or
    3. A public street would be necessary to provide adequate access to adjacent property not subject to the proposed short subdivision.

    2. The adjustment maintains the quality of design or product established by the original approval; and
    3. The adjustment does not cause a significant environmental or land use impact on or beyond the site; and
    4. The adjustment is not precluded by the terms of this title or by state law from being decided administratively; and
    5. Circumstances render it impractical, unfeasible or detrimental to the public interest to accomplish the subject condition or requirement of preliminary plat or short plat approval.
B. Major Adjustments. Major adjustments are those that, when determined by the planning director, substantially change the basic design, layout, open space or other requirements of the plat. When the planning director determines a change constitutes a major adjustment, a new application for a preliminary plat is required and shall be processed as a new and separate application. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5140 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4296 § 2, 1988. Formerly 17.06.100.)

B. If the preliminary plat approval is on or before December 31, 2007, then the final plat shall be submitted to the city for approval within nine years of the date of preliminary plat approval and not subject to requirements adopted under Chapter 90.58 RCW.
C. Extensions. The director or designee may administratively authorize through a Type I land use action extensions to preliminary plat approvals. For purposes of this section, the authority to issue extensions shall apply to preliminary plat approvals previously issued by the city. Extensions shall be issued in one-year increments up to a maximum of three years, subject to the following criteria and conditions:
    1. An applicant for an extension shall make a written request for the extension a minimum of 30 calendar days prior to expiration of the preliminary plat approval.
    2. The director or designee shall in consideration of granting an extension find:
        a. There have not been any substantial changes in the laws governing the development of the plat, with which lack of compliance would be contrary to the public health, safety and welfare; or
        b. The applicant has pursued final platting diligently, as evidenced by progress on final surveying, engineering, construction or the financial security of improvements; or
        c. There have been substantial changes in economic conditions and market forces that have substantively limited the ability of the applicant to pursue final platting.
    3. A condition of any extension approval shall be that the subdivision shall comply with state or federal mandates required of the city and/or life, health and safety requirements of the city in effect at the time of any extension approval.
D. At the same time the director or designee is considering the extension, he or she may add conditions or requirements upon factual determination that the addition of conditions or requirements will benefit the public health, safety and welfare.
E. A plat granted preliminary approval, but not filed for final plat approval within the applicable time period or extended time period, shall be null and void. (Ord. 6418 § 7, 2012; Ord. 6317 § 3, 2010; Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6186 § 6, 2008; Ord. 5140 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4296 § 2, 1988. Formerly 17.06.110.)

17.10.120 Development standards for panhandle lot access and private access tracts.
A. Panhandle Lot Access. 
    1. The maximum length of a panhandle lot access within the R-5, R-7, R-10, R-16, R-20, and RO zones and residential PUDs shall be 150 feet. When there are unique physical limitations of the property including but not limited to steep slopes, significant vegetation, or sensitive environmental areas that would be impacted less if a longer panhandle length were provided, then the planning director may allow additional length. The director may also allow for additional length if there is an existing intervening parcel of the property (that has a lot depth greater than 150 feet) between the proposed panhandle lot and the abutting street. There shall be no limitation of length within the other zoning districts of the city.
    2. All residential and nonresidential panhandle accesses shall meet the standards of the city of Auburn engineering, design and construction standards manual.
    3. If two panhandle accesses within the same plat abut each other, then one common paved driveway, spanning both panhandles, may be provided as part of the two panhandles. The pavement width of the driveway shall be determined using the same methodology as subsection (A)(2) of this section.
    4. Not more than two panhandle accesses within the same plat may abut each other. Alterna-tively, a separate access tract shall be required in lieu of more than two separate panhandle accesses. The separate access tract shall meet the requirements of subsection B of this section.
B. Private Access Tracts and/or Easements. 
    1. Private access tracts and/or easements will be allowed when it is physically impractical to provide a lot with direct access to a public street due to unique physical limitations of the property, including but not limited to steep slopes, significant vegetation, or sensitive environmental areas. If the lot abuts an arterial, an access tract may also be allowed to provide an alternate access to the lot if it is impractical to provide for another public street due to the aforementioned physical limitations. The use of access tracts cannot preclude or hinder the alignment of future public streets that would otherwise serve the area.
    2. Access tracts can only be created through a plat process pursuant to Chapter 17.09 ACC and this chapter. Ownership and maintenance responsibilities will also be determined as part of the plat process.
    3. The maximum number of lots to be served by one access tract shall be six. If a lot abuts an access tract and a public street, then the front lot line shall be oriented to the public.
    4. All access tracts and/or easements must connect to a public street and the maximum length shall be 150 feet as measured from the edge of the public street right-of-way. Additional length may be allowed if the unique physical limitations of the property including but not limited to steep slopes, significant vegetation, or sensitive environmental areas would be impacted less if additional length were provided. The access tract shall not allow for through vehicle access.
    5. Private access tracts and/or easements shall meet city of Auburn design and construction standards.
C. Emergency Access Provisions. Irrespective of the requirements of this section, additional provisions may be required if needed to provide for adequate emergency access as determined by the Auburn fire marshal. The additional provisions may include but not be limited to providing for turnarounds, additional access tract width, fire hydrants or sprinklering of the building.

A. Plans for improvements shall be prepared, signed, dated and stamped by a professional civil engineer registered in the state of Washington and shall be in accordance with city standards and specifications. Plans shall be submitted to the city, following preliminary plat approval, for circulation and review. No construction permit or approval shall be issued and no construction activity shall commence relating to subdivision improvements until the plans required by this chapter have been approved and signed by the city engineer.

C. Notwithstanding the previous requirement that civil plans for improvements shall be submitted following approval of the preliminary plat, the city may, in its sole discretion, allow an applicant/developer to submit plans after the department issues its recommendation to the hearing examiner and prior to preliminary plat approval; provided, that the applicant/developer recognizes and acknowledges that the city’s willingness to receive civil plans in advance of preliminary plat approval does not constitute a submittal which would vest any rights for the applicant/developer, and that the applicant/developer bears all risks of submitting plans in advance of preliminary plat approval. Furthermore, early submittal shall be allowed by the city only upon the applicant/developer entering into an agreement with the city whereby the applicant/developer agrees to the following:

    3. That the applicant/developer waives, on behalf of itself, heirs, assigns, successors, etc., any claim based on the city agreeing to allow plan submission and review before preliminary plat approval.
    4. That the applicant/developer will defend, indemnify, and hold the city harmless against any and all claims based on the city’s agreement to allow submission and review before preliminary plat approval.
    5. That the city’s acceptance of plans before preliminary plat approval does not create an obligation upon the city to accept plans prior to plat approval in the future.

    3. As a condition of the plat improvement permitting approval, the developer shall agree that in the case of the developer’s default or failure to complete the improvements as per the approved plans and conditions, including time schedules, the city shall have the authority to complete the construction of public improvements utilizing the above-described satisfactory security.
    4. The city engineer may further agree to allow the developer to utilize assignment of funds or irrevocable letter of credit or other security acceptable to the city engineer to cover the minimum warranty period.

C. By actual installation of the required improvements in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and in accordance with the city’s design and construction standards and under the supervision of the city engineer.
D. By a combination of these methods.
E. For any of the above combinations of methods, other than subsection C of this section, the plat developer shall execute and record against the plat properties a statement approved by the city attorney which holds the city harmless and limits the city’s financial obligation to construct any defaulted private utility facilities and public infrastructure for streets, water utility, sanitary sewer utility, or storm water utility systems to the face value of the bond shall be memorialized on the plat documents.

17.14.100 Parks and playgrounds.
Where dedication of land for park and recreation purposes is required, the hearing examiner shall be guided by the policies and recommended standards of the Auburn parks, recreation, and open space plan. It is the policy of the city to require park land dedication where a proposed subdivision will result in a substantial increase in demand for park land or is needed to prevent or abate public nuisances. Generally, this will occur where a subdivision will result in the creation of lots capable of supporting 50 or more residential dwelling units; however, where it is determined that the proposed subdivision, together with any reasonably anticipated future development on adjacent or nearby land, will act in a cumulative manner to substantially increase demand for park land, dedication may be required of smaller subdivisions. The acceptability of the size, configuration and location of land proposed for park dedication shall be determined by the hearing examiner based upon such factors as topography, drainage, natural amenities and access. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6186 § 10, 2008; Ord. 5164 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4772 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4296 § 2, 1988. Formerly 17.12.260.)

17.14.110 Floods and flood control.
The city may disapprove a proposed subdivision because of flood, inundation or swamp condition if the city finds that such condition poses a threat to the public health, safety or general welfare or causes a public nuisance.
Where any portion of the proposed subdivision lies within the regulatory floodplain, the hearing examiner shall impose a condition on the preliminary plat requiring the subdivider to conform to the city’s floodplain development requirements as set forth in Chapter 15.68 ACC. In such cases, no development permit associated with the proposed subdivision shall be issued by the city until said flood hazard area regulations have been met.
The city may require dedication of land to any public body and/or the construction of improvements and may impose other conditions necessary to protect against flooding or inundation. (Ord. 6295 § 7, 2010; Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6186 § 11, 2008; Ord. 5164 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4772 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4296 § 2, 1988. Formerly 17.12.270.)

17.14.120 Additional requirements.
The standards and requirements established or referenced by this chapter are minimum requirements. These standards may be increased, and additional requirements may be imposed for the purpose of preventing or abating public nuisances or mitigating identified adverse environmental impacts pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (Chapter 43.21C RCW) as now established or hereafter modified. Such additional requirements may include but shall not be limited to off-site improvements to any public facility, the dedication and/or improvement of parks and open spaces, and monetary contributions to any city fund established to finance the provision of public services required by the subdivision. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5164 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4772 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4296 § 2, 1988. Formerly 17.12.280.)

17.16.010 Neighborhood circulation plan.
A. Purpose. A neighborhood circulation plan is a conceptual plan that outlines the vehicular and nonmotorized circulation within and between a proposed plat and the surrounding area consistent with the city’s comprehensive transportation plan. The neighborhood circulation plan allows the city to coordinate and plan for future circulation networks that will provide transportation alternatives for citizens of the city.
B. Applicability. A neighborhood circulation plan shall be submitted for all preliminary plats and binding site plans pursuant to application requirements of Chapters 17.10 and 17.24 ACC.
C. Components of a Neighborhood Circulation Plan. The neighborhood circulation plan shall show the following:
    1. Planned Street System. The planned street system must be compatible with the city’s comprehensive transportation plan. Development which is proposed in areas of the city which have a planned street system which is a part of the comprehensive plan or the city’s six-year plan, and any other street plan, shall make provisions for such streets and must not cause implementation of such street plans to become unattainable.
    2. Nonmotorized Transportation Routes. Preliminary plats and binding site plans which are proposed in areas of the city which have planned routes or facilities for bicycles, equestrian, or other nonmotorized transportation mode which is a part of the comprehensive plan or the city’s six-year plan, and any other street plan, shall make provisions for such routes and must not cause implementation of such routes to become unattainable.
    3. A nonmotorized circulation system shall be integrated into the overall subdivision and surrounding area.
        a. When abutting vacant or underdeveloped land, new development shall provide the opportunity for future connection to its interior pathway system through the use of pathway stub-outs, building configuration, and/or parking lot layout. The proposed location of future nonmotorized and pedestrian connections shall be reviewed in conjunction with applicable development approval.
        b. Developments shall include an integrated nonmotorized circulation system that connects buildings, open spaces, and parking areas with the adjacent street sidewalk system.
        c. Pedestrian connections to existing or proposed trails/pedestrian routes on adjacent properties shall be provided unless there are physical constraints such as sensitive areas that preclude the construction of a pedestrian connection. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

    4. Permitted Density. The maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a cluster development shall be no greater than the number of dwelling units allowed pursuant to Chapter 18.07 ACC, as modified by Chapter 18.21 ACC.
    5. Lot Size. The lot area of individual building lots within a cluster subdivision or short subdivision shall be no less than that provided for in Chapter 18.07 ACC, as modified by Chapter 18.21 ACC. New lots created by any subdivision or short subdivision action shall be clustered in groups not exceeding eight units. There may be more than one cluster per project. Separation between cluster groups shall be a minimum of 120 feet.
    6. Lot Width. The lot width for individual building lots in a cluster subdivision or short subdivision shall be no less than that provided for in Chapter 18.07 ACC, as modified by Chapter 18.21 ACC.
    7. Other Development Standards. Development standards other than lot size and lot width shall be the same as are required by Chapter 18.07 ACC, as modified by Chapter 18.21 ACC.
    8. Common Open Space. 
        a. Amount Required. The common open space in a cluster subdivision or short subdivision shall be a minimum of 50 percent of the parcel, and may include critical areas and their buffers.
        b. Nonconstrained Areas Defined. For purposes of this section, the nonconstrained area of the parcel is defined as all areas of the parcel, minus critical areas, as defined in Chapter 16.10 ACC as currently and hereinafter amended, and buffers.
        c. Buildable Area. After accounting for the 50 percent open space requirement, the remainder of the nonconstrained area of the parcel shall be the buildable area of the parcel.
        d. Layout of Common Open Space. The common open space tracts created by clustering shall be located and configured in the manner that best connects and increases protective buffers for environmentally sensitive areas, connects and protects area wildlife habitat, creates connectivity between the open space provided by the clustering and other adjacent open spaces as well as existing or planned public parks and trails, and maintains scenic vistas.
        e. Future Development Prohibited. Future development of the common open space shall be prohibited. Except as specified on recorded documents creating the common open space, all common open space resulting from lot clustering shall not be altered or disturbed in a manner that degrades adjacent environmentally sensitive areas, rural areas, agricultural areas, or resource lands; impairs scenic vistas and the connectivity between the open space provided by the clustered development and adjacent open spaces; degrades wildlife habitat; or impairs the recreational benefits enjoyed by the residents of the development.
        f. Conveyance of Common Open Space. Such common open spaces shall be conveyed to residents of the development, conveyed to a homeowners’ association for the benefit of the residents of the development, or conveyed to the city with the city’s consent and approval. (Ord. 6239 § 1, 2009.)

Chapter 18.01 USER GUIDE

Sections:
18.01.010    What is the purpose of the zoning code?
18.01.020    I am unclear on some of the terms used in the code. Where can I find definitions?
18.01.030    How do I determine what uses are allowed on a particular property?
18.01.040    Where do I find information about landscaping, signs, and parking requirements?
18.01.050    How do city zoning and land use regulations relate to Indian lands?

18.01.010 What is the purpose of the zoning code?
The zoning code provides information on land use regulations, dimensional standards, and certain other development standards that apply to property within the city (i.e., landscaping standards, parking standards, sign standards, etc.). The information in the zoning code is presented by zone and land use type, so it is important to consult the city’s official zoning map to determine what zone applies to a given property.
The zoning code constitutes Title 18 of the Auburn City Code (ACC), and is organized as a series of chapters. General zoning code provisions are presented in Chapter 18.02 ACC. This chapter contains the basic rules of interpretation for the zoning code, and includes a complete list of the city’s zones. This chapter is a resource for users who may be unfamiliar with zoning codes and are unsure of how a particular regulation applies to them. Procedural sections of the code and decision criteria are addressed in Chapters 18.60 through 18.72 ACC. (Ord. 6245 § 1, 2009.)

18.01.020 I am unclear on some of the terms used in the code. Where can I find definitions?
Chapter 18.04 ACC provides definitions for terms used throughout this title. Where appropriate, sketches and other graphic illustrations have been used to help explain terms and concepts. While every effort has been made to define terms consistent with common usage, users should consult this section to familiarize themselves and reduce the potential for misunderstandings. This section also contains explanations and illustrations of complex concepts that may not be familiar to all users. (Ord. 6245 § 1, 2009.)

18.01.030 How do I determine what uses are allowed on a particular property?
The first step in determining allowed uses is verifying the zoning on the property, which can be done by speaking with city of Auburn planning department staff or by consulting the city’s official zoning map. When verifying a property’s zoning, it is also important to note any overlays that may be marked on the zoning map. Overlays may have additional requirements or otherwise modify the allowed uses and development standards for a zone. Regulations for overlays, such as those established for Lea Hill, West Hill, and designated urban separator areas, are contained in Chapter 18.21 ACC.
The sections devoted to particular zones described on the zoning map form the framework of the zoning code. Each of these sections contains the intent statement for the particular zone, a table of allowed uses, as well as tables for dimensional standards (building height, setbacks, and lot coverage) and cross-references to other standards such as landscaping and parking requirements. It is important to note that each section contains only regulations that apply specifically to that zone, and development standards that apply to all zones are addressed through cross-references to other chapters of the zoning code. (Ord. 6245 § 1, 2009.)

18.01.040 Where do I find information about landscaping, signs, and parking requirements?
In order to make the individual zone chapters easier to read, supplementary regulations or specialized topics applied more broadly than at a specific zone level, such as landscaping, parking, signage, and nonconforming uses, are discussed separately. Chapters 18.50 through 18.56 ACC provide detailed information on these and similarly broad topics. While the relevant portions of these sections will be referenced by the zone-specific chapters, these chapters are also a good place to look for information on existing or proposed land uses not explicitly listed elsewhere in the code. (Ord. 6245 § 1, 2009.)

18.01.050 How do city zoning and land use regulations relate to Indian lands?
The city of Auburn recognizes and acknowledges that the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe has jurisdiction and land use control over Indian lands. The designation of city zoning and land use regulations that might appear to affect any Indian lands does not, and is not intended to, usurp or exercise land use control over such lands. Any such city regulations are intended to identify what zoning or land-use provisions would apply to such lands were they not under Indian jurisdiction, or were the land to change in ownership or jurisdictional character. Until those circumstances change for such lands, the city regulations shall be for informational purposes only. (Ord. 6667 § 6, 2017.)

18.02.010 Short title.
This title shall be known as “the comprehensive zoning ordinance” of the city, which shall constitute Title 18 of the Auburn City Code and shall hereafter be referred to as “this title.” (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.02.020 Authority to adopt code.
A. The city of Auburn comprehensive zoning ordinance is adopted by city of Auburn ordinance, pursuant to Article XI, Section 11 of the Washington State Constitution, the State Growth Management Act, RCW Title 35A, Optional Municipal Code, and Chapter 36.70B RCW. In accordance with ACC 1.04.060.
B. Notwithstanding any provisions otherwise, this title does not permit or allow any action, use or conduct which is in violation of or prohibited by any state or federal laws, regulations or codes. Any action, use or conduct which is prohibited by state or federal law is prohibited hereby. It is provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection B do not apply to any person or persons who has/have a valid, lawful license issued by the state of Washington to produce, process or sell marijuana, marijuana concentrates, usable marijuana and/or marijuana-infused products and is acting in full conformity with the requirements of the state of Washington related to such license pursuant to RCW 69.50.301 through 69.50.369, and WAC 314-55-005 through 314-55-540. In such instances, the state of Washington, not the city, is the permitting and licensing entity. It is provided, however, that this provision does not preclude the city from taking enforcement action in instances where conduct or activity that is licensed or permitted under RCW 69.50.301 through 69.50.369, and WAC 314-55-005 through 314-55-540 occurs within the city of Auburn but is not in compliance with or violates the requirements of such state licensing or permitting. For the purposes of this section only, the provisions of RCW 69.50.325 through 69.50.369, and WAC 314-55-515 through 314-55-535 are hereby adopted by reference and incorporated herein. (Ord. 6525 § 5, 2014; Ord. 6416 § 4, 2012; Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.030 Purpose.
A. The purpose of this title is to implement the city’s comprehensive plan. This title will be used to further the growth and development of the city consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan and its implementing elements. This title will also further the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare of the city’s population and to prevent and abate public nuisances.
B. The specific zones and regulations set out in this title are designed to:
    1. Provide adequate public facilities and services, including utilities, roads, schools, and parks in conjunction with development;
    2. Provide housing with essential light, air, privacy, and open space;
    3. Facilitate the safe and efficient movement of traffic on the city’s streets;
    4. Stabilize and enhance property values;
    5. Facilitate adequate provisions for doing public and private business and thereby safeguard the community’s economic structure upon which the prosperity and welfare of all depends; and
    6. Through such achievements, help ensure the safety and security of home life, foster good citizenship, and create and preserve a more healthful, serviceable and attractive municipality and environment in which to live.
C. To most effectively accomplish these purposes, this title divides the city into zones wherein the location, height and use of buildings, the use of land, the size of setback areas and other open space, and the provision of off-street parking and loading are regulated and restricted in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the city. These zones and regulations are deemed necessary and are made with reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character of each zone and its particular suitability for specific uses, the need for such uses, the common rights and interests of all within the zone as well as those of the general public, and with the view of conserving and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the city and to prevent and abate public nuisances. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987. Formerly 18.02.020.)

18.02.040 Applicability.
A. The provisions of this title shall apply to both public and private use of land within the corporate limits of the city.
B. Hereafter, no use shall be conducted, and no building, structure and appurtenance shall be erected, relocated, remodeled, reconstructed, altered or enlarged unless in compliance with the provisions of this title, and then only after securing all permits and approvals required hereby. It shall be unlawful to build or use any building or structure or to use premises in the city for any purpose or use other than the uses listed as being permitted in the zone in which such building, land, or premises is located.
C. Any building, structure or use lawfully existing at the time of passage of this title, although not in compliance herewith, may continue as provided in Chapter 18.54 ACC.
D. No division of land shall occur unless in compliance with the provisions of this title and ACC Title 17, Land Adjustments and Divisions.
E. This title is not intended to regulate the erection, construction, or reconstruction of public streets, power poles, street lights, utility facilities, utility conveyance or storage systems, transmission lines, or other public uses necessary to support the general public welfare, carried on by the city, or agents of the city working under the appropriate contract or franchise. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987. Formerly 18.02.030.)

18.02.050 Minimum requirements.
A. In interpretation and application, the requirements set forth in this title shall be considered the minimum requirements necessary to accomplish the purpose of this title.
B. It is not the intent of this title to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between private parties. However, where this title imposes a greater restriction upon the use of land and/or buildings or in general requires higher standards than other ordinances, rules, or private agreements, the provisions of this title shall govern. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.060 Rules for administrative interpretations.
A. The planning director shall be authorized to interpret the meaning of words, phrases and sentences which relate to the determining of uses permitted in the various zones, approval or disapproval of development plans, or other related zoning actions. Any interpretations regarding implementation of this title shall be made in accordance with the intent or purpose statement of the specific regulation and the comprehensive plan. Life, safety and public health regulations are assumed to prevail over all other regulations.
B. The planning director may authorize uses in a zone other than those which are listed, if the planning director determines the use is consistent with the intent of the zone and is of the same general character of the uses permitted within the zone. Further guidance on administrative interpretations of land uses can be found in ACC 18.02.120.
C. Administrative interpretations may be appealed to the hearing examiner as prescribed in Chapter 18.70 ACC.
D. Administrative interpretations made by the planning director shall be documented, made available for public review, and docketed for inclusion to this title, when consistent with the title format and level of detail required. The city shall incorporate administrative interpretations upon approval of the legislative authority. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987. Formerly 18.02.040.)

18.02.065 Methods of calculating density.
The permitted number of dwelling units or lots shall be determined as follows:
A. Gross Site Area. The gross site area shall be used to calculate both the minimum and maximum number of allowed dwelling units or lots.
    1. When calculations result in a fraction, the fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number as follows:
        a. Fractions of one-half or above shall be rounded up; and
        b. Fractions below one-half shall be rounded down.
    2. Calculating Base Density. Base density is calculated by multiplying the gross site area by the upper limit of units or lots allowed within the zone. For example, in the R-5 zone, where the density range allows up to five dwelling units per acre:
    4.3 acres gross site area x 5 units per acre = 21.5 (rounded up to 22)
    3. Calculating Minimum Density. Minimum density is calculated by multiplying the gross site area by the lower limit of units or lots allowed within the zone. For example, in the R-5 zone, where the density range allows as few as four dwelling units per acre:
    4.3 acres gross site area x 4 units per acre = 17.2 (rounded down to 17)
    4. Each lot shall meet the requirements established in Chapter 18.07 ACC for lot area, dimensions, setbacks, and other development standards.
    5. Where a proposed area for subdivision cannot meet the minimum density due to encumbrance by critical areas, critical area buffers, or other similar types of features that preclude development, the applicant may seek to deviate from the minimum density which will be reviewed as an administrative decision as part of the subdivision application. If the applicant seeks a variance from the development standards in Chapter 18.07 ACC the variance shall be processed utilizing the provisions of ACC 18.70.010. Alterations of a critical area or its buffer shall be processed in accordance with Chapter 16.10 ACC. Compliance with the density requirements of the underlying zone shall not be used as justification for alteration of a critical area.
B. The minimum density requirements shall not apply to short plats that are processed under Chapter 17.09 ACC.
C. Bonus density, where applicable, shall be computed by adding the bonus units authorized by Chapter 18.25 or 18.49 ACC to the base units computed under this section. (Ord. 6661 § 1, 2018; Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.070 Establishment of zones.
A. The city is divided into the following classes of zones:
    1. RC, residential conservancy zone (one dwelling unit per four acres);
    2. R-1, residential zone (one dwelling unit per acre);
    3. R-5, residential zone (five dwelling units per acre);
    4. R-7, residential zone (seven dwelling units per acre);
    5. R-10, residential zone (10 dwelling units per acre);
    6. R-16, residential zone (16 dwelling units per acre);
    7. R-20, residential zone (20 dwelling units per acre);
    8. RMHC, manufactured/mobile home community zone;
    9. RO, residential office zone, and RO-H, residential office-hospital zone;
    10. C-N, neighborhood shopping zone;
    11. C-1, light commercial zone;
    12. C-2, central business zone;
    13. C-3, heavy commercial zone;
    14. M-1, light industrial zone;
    15. M-2, heavy industrial zone;
    16. BP, business park zone;
    17. LF, airport landing field zone;
    18. P-1, public use zone;
    19. UNC, unclassified use zone;
    20. I, institutional use zone;
    21. EP, environmental park zone;
    22. DUC, downtown urban center zone;
    23. OS, open space zone.
B. The zones set out in subsection A of this section are established as the designations, locations, and boundaries thereof as set forth and indicated on the zoning map.
C. The intent statement for each zone set forth in this title shall be used to guide the application of the zones to all lands in the city of Auburn. The intent statements shall guide interpretation and application of land use regulations within the zones, and any change to the range of allowed uses within each zone through amendment to this title. (Ord. 6677 § 1, 2018; Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.080 Zoning map.
A. “Zoning map,” as used in this title, is that certain map, three copies of which are on file in the office of the city clerk, labeled “Comprehensive Zoning Map of the City of Auburn, Washington,” dated June 1, 1987, and adopted by Ordinance No. 4230 and signed by the mayor and city clerk, along with all amendments thereto. Two types of amendments to the zoning map may occur. The map may be either amended on an areawide basis initiated by the planning commission, city council, or planning and development committee of the city council, or a specific parcel amended by the rezone process as outlined in Chapter 18.68 ACC.
B. Current copies of the zoning map are available for examination and/or purchase at the planning and development department. The zoning map is adopted and made a part of the comprehensive zoning ordinance, with the most current amended copy as being the official zoning map. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.090 Zone boundary interpretation.
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zones as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
A. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such lines;
B. Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines;
C. Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following city limits;
D. Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed as to be midway between the main tracks;
E. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections A through D of this section shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map;
F. Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at a variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered by subsections A through E of this section, the planning director shall interpret the zone boundaries;
G. When the city vacates a street or alley, the vacated property will be zoned consistent with the adjacent property it is being vacated to. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.100 Zoning for annexed land.
Prior to any parcel of land being annexed to the city, the property may be zoned consistent with the rezone requirements of this title and the comprehensive plan may be amended if necessary.
Application for the rezone and any necessary amendment may be done simultaneously with the request for annexation.
For property that is not assigned a zone classification by the city of Auburn at annexation, the property shall assume the UNC unclassified use designation upon annexation.
In such case, the planning director shall initiate an application to rezone from the UNC unclassified use designation to a zone compatible with the comprehensive plan within six months of the date of annexation. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5354 § 2, 2000; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987. Formerly 18.02.050.)

18.02.110 Zoning for property influenced by Auburn Municipal Airport.
Refer to Chapter 18.38 ACC to determine if property will be required to comply with additional regulations that are associated with the airport. (Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997. Formerly 18.02.060.)

18.02.120 Permitted land uses established.
A. Categories of Uses Established. Chapters 18.07 through 18.44 ACC establish permitted, administrative, conditional, and prohibited uses, by zone, for all properties within the Auburn city limits. All principal uses in a given zone are one of four types:
    1. Permitted use (see ACC 18.04.696);
    2. Administrative use (see ACC 18.04.025);
    3. Conditional use (see ACC 18.04.260);
    4. Prohibited use (see ACC 18.04.752).
Uses which are incidental and customary to a principal use may be considered an accessory use as defined in ACC 18.04.020.
Uses not specifically identified as principal uses or determined to be an accessory use shall be classified utilizing the procedures outlined in subsection (C)(6) of this section.
B. Zoning Use Tables Established for Residential Zones. The zone use tables in ACC 18.07.020 and 18.09.020 establish whether a specific use is permitted in a zone and whether the use is allowed as a permitted, administrative, conditional, or prohibited use. The zone is located on the horizontal row and the specific use is located on the vertical column of these tables.
C. Interpretation of Zone Use Tables.
    1. Legend. The following letters have the following meanings when they appear in the box at the intersection of the column and the row on the zone use tables:
    +--------+--------------------+
    | Symbol |    Description     |
    +--------+--------------------+
    | P      | Permitted Use      |
    +--------+--------------------+
    | A      | Administrative Use |
    +--------+--------------------+
    | C      | Conditional Use    |
    +--------+--------------------+
    | X      | Prohibited Use     |
    +--------+--------------------+
    2. Other Requirements Applicable. The above uses are subject to the other application requirements, citywide property development standards, and applicable overlay district regulations specified in the zoning code, the project review procedures specified in ACC Title 14, the building and construction standards of ACC Title 15, the environmental review procedures and regulations specified in ACC Title 16, and the regulations for the division of land in ACC Title 17.
    3. Additional Use-Related Conditions. If a number also appears at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is also subject to the additional requirements as listed in the corresponding endnote immediately following the use table in the specified code chapter. All applicable requirements shall govern a use whether specifically identified in the zone chapter or not.
    4. Accessory Use Interpretation. The planning director or designee may determine if a use that is not specifically described as accessory is permitted as an accessory to a principal use in a zone. Upon inquiry by an applicant, an administrative interpretation shall be made by the planning director or designee to determine if a proposed use is allowed as an accessory use within the zone utilizing the purpose and intent of the zone, comprehensive plan policy guidance, and the definition of accessory use contained in Chapter 18.04 ACC.
    5. Prohibited Uses. If an “X” appears in the box at the intersection of the column and the row, the use is prohibited in that zone. Similarly, if a use is listed in one zone use table but not another zone use table, it shall be considered prohibited in the zone use table in which it is not listed. For example, a use listed in the industrial zone use table of Chapter 18.16 ACC, but not listed in the residential zone use table of Chapter 18.07 ACC, shall be considered prohibited in the residential zones listed in Chapter 18.07 ACC even though the land use does not appear with an “X” in the use table.
    6. Unclassified Uses. Upon inquiry by an applicant, an administrative interpretation shall be made by the planning director or designee to determine if a proposed use not specifically listed in any zone use table is allowed within a specific zone utilizing the criteria in this subsection. Should an interpretation be made that a proposed, unlisted use not be allowed in a specific zone, the planning director or designee shall indicate which zones, if any, do permit the use.
        a. Criteria for Unclassified Uses. In order to make a determination that an unclassified use is permitted, administratively permitted, conditionally permitted, or accessory, the planning director or designee must find that the use is:
            i. In keeping with the intent of the zone, and consistent with Auburn comprehensive plan policies; and
            ii. Similar in nature to, and no more intense than, specifically listed permitted, conditional or accessory uses; and
            iii. Consistent with subsection (C)(4) of this section, if determined to be permissible as an accessory use. (Ord. 6269 § 1, 2009; Ord. 6245 § 2, 2009.)

18.02.130 Neighborhood review meeting.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the neighborhood review meeting is for a developer/applicant of a proposed project to hold a meeting with surrounding and adjacent neighboring residents, property owners, homeowners’ associations, residents and businesses (hereinafter collectively referred to as “neighbors”) prior to submitting an application to the city. The neighbors would have an early opportunity to become familiar with either a residential subdivision, multifamily or mixed development proposal of a certain size and scale early in the development review process and to identify any associated issues. The neighborhood review meeting is intended to assist in producing applications that are responsive to neighborhood concerns, and to reduce the likelihood of delays and appeals. The city expects an applicant to take into consideration the reasonable concerns and recommendations of the neighbors and other interested persons when preparing an application.
B. Applicability. A neighborhood review meeting shall be required for the following types of new land use application in any applicable zoning district within the city:
    1. A residential subdivision project comprising 40 or more lots or units; or
    2. A multifamily residential project comprising 40 or more units; or
    3. A mixed-use development project comprising 40 or more units.
C. Time Frames. 
    1. Prior to submittal of an application, an applicant shall provide an opportunity to meet with neighboring residents, property owners, homeowners’ associations, residents and businesses (hereinafter collectively referred to as “neighbors”) within the city-specified notice radius to review the proposal.
    2. The applicant shall not be required to hold more than one neighborhood review meeting.
D. Procedures. 
    1. The applicant shall select the meeting time and place. The starting time selected shall be limited to a weekday evening after 6:00 p.m. or a weekend at any reasonable time and shall not occur on a federally recognized holiday. The meeting shall be held at a location open to the public and in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The public meeting shall be held within the Auburn city limits, at a location no further than two miles from the project site, unless an alternate meeting location is approved by the planning director. A sign at least 22 inches by 28 inches in size with minimum two-inch lettering shall be placed at the main entrance of the building where the meeting will take place at least one hour prior to the meeting. Such sign will announce the meeting purpose, that the meeting is open to the public and that interested persons are invited to attend. This sign shall be removed upon conclusion of the meeting by the applicant.
    2. The applicant shall send by regular mail a written notice announcing the neighborhood review meeting to the director of the city of Auburn planning and development department and property owners within 300 feet of the property(ies) involved in the development review application. The notice shall include the date, time and location of the meeting and briefly discuss the nature and location of the proposal. The notice shall be mailed not less than 20 calendar days prior to the meeting date. The mailing list shall be obtained by the applicant and based on the most recent property tax assessment rolls of the King County department of assessments or the Pierce County assessor-treasurer’s office, whichever is applicable.
    3. Not less than 20 calendar days prior to the neighborhood review meeting, the applicant shall post a notice on the property which is the subject of the proposed application. The notice shall be posted at the property in a visible and accessible location. The notice shall state that the site may be subject to a proposed development and shall set forth the name of the applicant and a telephone number where the applicant or applicant’s contact person can be reached for additional information. The site shall remain posted until the conclusion of the neighborhood review meeting. The city will not be responsible for posting of any signs.
    4. The sign at the building entrance under subsection (D)(1) of this section, the notices sent by mail under subsection (D)(2) of this section and the site posting under subsection (D)(3) of this section shall each contain the following statement:The intent of this meeting is to facilitate an early informal discussion between the project developer and the neighbors regarding the project. While required by the City of Auburn, this meeting is not conducted by the City of Auburn and is in addition to any future hearings or public comment opportunities available under city development review processes.
    5. At the neighborhood review meeting, the applicant shall describe the proposed application to persons in attendance. The attendees may identify any issues that they believe should be addressed in the application and recommend that those issues be submitted for city consideration and analysis.
    6. The applicant shall prepare and make available the following materials for review and discussion at the public meeting:
        a. Total number of dwelling units/lots expected to be built;
        b. Conceptual site plan/plat layout showing buildings, road layout, landscape, parking, topography and open space areas, and adjacent properties; and
        c. Aerial photograph showing the subject property and adjacent properties.
    7. At the neighborhood review meeting, a sign-in sheet shall be distributed to all meeting attendees that specifies the date, time and location of the neighborhood review meeting and asks for the name, address, phone number and electronic mail address of each meeting attendee.
    8. At the neighborhood review meeting, the applicant shall take notes of the discussion on the proposed application for eventual submittal to the city.
E. Submittal Requirements. The applicant shall submit the following information with the submittal of a development application:
    1. A copy of the notice provided to surrounding property owners within 300 feet of the proposed development site.
    2. A copy of the mailing list used to send out meeting notices.
    3. A written statement containing the information posted on the property.
    4. An affidavit of mailing and posting notices.
    5. A copy of the meeting sign-in sheet.
    6. Copies of written materials and eight-and-one-half-inch by 11-inch size plans presented at the neighborhood review meeting.
    7. Notes of the meeting including a summary of oral and written comments received.
    8. If responses to the meeting notice were not received by the applicant and no one attended the neighborhood review meeting or persons in attendance made no comments, the applicant shall submit evidence as indicated above, with the notes reflecting the absence of comment, attendance, or both.
F. Notice. 
    1. All property owners who receive notice of the neighborhood review meeting shall be eligible to receive a copy of the written city decision for the development proposal.
    2. All neighbors receiving notice of or attending the neighborhood review meeting shall be eligible to receive a copy of the written city decision for the development proposal through a request made to the city.
G. Consideration. The city shall consider as part of the development review process the concerns and issues raised by the neighbors and applicant at the neighborhood review meeting, including any agreed-upon solutions or resolutions to outstanding issues or areas of contention. The city, however, shall not be bound in its decision-making by any agreements or understandings made between the neighbors and applicants. Nothing in this section shall be construed to delegate design or project review decision-making authority to the participants in the public meeting.
H. City Involvement. The neighborhood review meeting is intended to be a developer-neighborhood interaction. City staff are not required to attend and/or participate in neighborhood review meetings. There will be other official opportunities for residents and neighbors to make comment during the development review process that would follow the neighborhood review meeting. The director of the planning and development department or designee shall be notified a minimum of seven calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the neighborhood review meeting. Any city staff attendance at a neighborhood review meeting is for informational purposes only, does not represent the city’s position on the merits of the development proposal and does not constitute an approval or denial of an application, now or submitted in the future.

Chapter 18.07 RESIDENTIAL ZONES

Sections:
18.07.010    Intent.
18.07.020    Uses.
18.07.030    Development standards.

18.07.010 Intent.
A. General. This section describes the intent for each of the city’s residential zones. These intent statements may be used to guide the interpretation of the regulations associated with each zone.
B. RC Residential Conservancy Zone – One Dwelling Unit per Four Acres. The RC residential conservancy zone is intended primarily to provide for low-intensity single-family residential uses with characteristics of an agricultural environment; provided, that the agricultural uses are secondary to the single-family uses. These areas allow for a lifestyle similar to that of rural areas that includes allowance of farm animals and streets without sidewalks. This zone is intended to protect areas with significant environmental constraints or values from impacts typically associated with urban levels of development while allowing low-intensity development designed to minimize impacts on the natural environmental features designated for conservation.
Public improvements required within the RC zone will be less than is normally required for the higher intensity residential zones within the city.
This zone shall only be applied in areas designated as residential conservancy on the comprehensive plan. This zone shall allow one dwelling unit per four acres minimum lot area.
C. R-1 Residential Zone – One Dwelling Unit per Acre. The intent of the R-1 residential zone is to provide areas for estate-type residential development on large lots. This zone would normally be located in the areas particularly suited for such development.
Appropriate development standards required of other urban areas shall be required to serve this zone.
D. R-5 Residential Zone – Five Dwelling Units per Acre. The R-5 single-family residential zones are intended to create a living environment of optimum standards for single-family dwellings. It is further intended to achieve development densities of four to five dwelling units per net acre. This zone will provide for the development of single-family detached dwellings and for such accessory uses as are related, incidental and not detrimental to the single-family residential environment.
E. R-7 Residential Zone – Seven Dwelling Units per Acre. The R-7 single-family residential zones are intended to create a living environment of optimum standards for single-family dwellings. It is further intended to achieve development densities of five to seven dwelling units per net acre. This zone will provide for the development of single-family detached dwellings and for such accessory uses as are related, incidental and not detrimental to the residential environment.
F. R-10 Residential Zone – 10 Dwelling Units per Acre. The R-10 residential zones are intended to permit some increase in population density in those areas to which this classification applies by permitting single-family dwellings and duplexes on a minimum size lot while at the same time, by means of the standards and requirements set forth in this chapter, maintaining a desirable family living environment by establishing minimum lot areas, yards and open spaces. A related consideration is to provide a transition between single-family areas and other intensive designations or activities which reduce the suitability for single-family uses.
G. R-16 Residential Zone – 16 Dwelling Units per Acre. The R-16 zone is intended to provide for medium density multiple-family residential development as designated in the comprehensive plan, and is further intended as a residential zone of single, duplex and multiple-family residences, except as specifically provided elsewhere in this chapter.
H. R-20 Residential Zone – 20 Dwelling Units per Acre. The R-20 zone is intended to provide for multiple-family residential development and is further intended as a residential zone primarily of multiple-family residences, except as specifically provided elsewhere in this chapter. A related consideration is to make it possible to more efficiently and economically design and install all physical public service facilities in terms of size and capacity to adequately and permanently meet needs resulting from a defined intensity of land use.
I. Except as specifically provided in the city code, no business or commercial use shall be allowed in a residential district of the city that does not have a city of Auburn business license. (Ord. 6525 § 6, 2014; Ord. 6245 § 5, 2009.)

18.08.090    Amendments.

18.08.010 Purpose of the planned action.
The purpose of this chapter is to:
A. Set forth a procedure designating certain project actions within a specific subject site as “planned actions” consistent with state law, RCW 43.21C.031; and
B. Provide the public with an understanding as to what constitutes a planned action and how land use applications which qualify as planned actions will be processed by the city; and
C. Streamline and expedite the development review process for this designated planned action by relying on completed and existing detailed environmental analysis for the subject site; and
D. Combine environmental analysis with land use planning; and
E. Apply the city’s development regulations together with the mitigation measures described in the environmental impact statement (EIS) and this chapter to address the impacts of future development contemplated by the planned action. (Ord. 6382 § 2, 2011.)

18.08.020 Findings related to the northeast Auburn special area plan.
After thorough review and consideration, the city council makes the following findings:
A. The Northeast Auburn special area plan (“subarea plan”) and its accompanying draft and final environmental impact statement (“EIS”) and EIS addenda have analyzed and addressed all of the probable significant environmental impacts associated with the land uses allowed by the city’s development regulations and described in the subarea plan as to the Northeast Auburn special planning area.
B. The analysis contained in the subarea plan and EIS and addenda is adequate to identify the probable environmental impacts of developments allowed under the city’s development regulations which were not previously analyzed in the comprehensive plan and its accompanying environmental documents.
C. The mitigation measures identified in the environmental element of the subarea plan, EIS and EIS addenda, together with the regulations in the city’s development code, are adequate to identify and mitigate the probable significant environmental impacts of the land uses and developments considered within the planned action and subarea plan and EIS documents.
D. The expedited development review procedure in this chapter is consistent with law, will be a benefit to the public, will protect the environment, and will enhance the city’s economic development.
E. The public interest will be served by implementing the expedited development review procedure set forth in this chapter.
F. Public involvement and review of the subarea plan and EIS and addenda have been extensive and meet the requirements of law, and have been sufficient to ensure that the subarea plan and EIS bear a substantial relationship to the public interest, health, safety, and welfare.
G. The land uses identified in the subarea plan for the Northeast Auburn special area are consistent with and will implement the comprehensive plan.
H. Northeast Auburn special area is hereby designated a planned action. (Ord. 6382 § 2, 2011.)

18.08.030 Applicability of the planned action.
A. Planned Action Area. This chapter applies to approximately 70 acres included in the Auburn Gateway project area as described in the Northeast Auburn/Robertson Properties special area plan EIS, issued by the city on July 30, 2004 (and any addenda thereto) and the adoption of the Northeast Auburn/Robertson Properties special area plan. Any other planned action for which the impacts have been studied in an EIS shall also meet the requirements of this chapter, be approved by the planning and community development director (director), and be designated as a planned action by resolution of the city council before it shall be entitled to review and treatment as a planned action under this chapter.
B. Environmental Document. A planned action for a site-specific development shall be based on the environmental analysis contained in the Northeast Auburn/Robertson Properties special area plan EIS, issued by the city on July 30, 2004 (and any addenda thereto). The mitigation requirements in this chapter are based on the Northeast Auburn/Robertson Properties special area plan EIS. These requirements, together with city codes, ordinances, and standards provide the framework for the decision by the city to impose conditions on a planned action project.
C. Planned Action Designated. Uses and activities described in the Northeast Auburn/Robertson Properties special area plan EIS (and any addenda thereto), subject to thresholds (ACC 18.08.040) and mitigation measures established by this chapter, are designated planned actions pursuant to RCW 43.21C.031. (Ord. 6382 § 2, 2011.)

18.08.040 Planned action thresholds.
Subject to the zoning regulations for the site and the mitigation measures described in this chapter, the maximum levels of development described below have been evaluated in the Northeast Auburn/Robertson Properties special area plan EIS, as described in the EIS (and any addenda thereto), and are planned actions pursuant to RCW 43.21C.031. In order to qualify as a planned action, total cumulative development within the Auburn Gateway project area that has been permitted under this chapter shall meet all of the following criteria:
A. Land Use. 
    1. The following are the primary categories of uses authorized under this planned action:
        a. Office.
        b. Retail.

18.08.050 Review criteria for planned actions.
The director or director’s designee is hereby authorized to designate a project application as a planned action if the project meets all of the following conditions:
A. The project is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan.
B. The project is located on the subject site as described with the planned action ordinance.
C. The project’s significant environmental impacts have been adequately addressed in the EIS.
D. The project complies with the planned action thresholds.
E. The project’s significant impacts have been mitigated though application of the mitigation measures identified in the EIS documents and other city requirements.

A. Upon designation by the planning director that the project qualifies as a planned action, the project shall not be subject to a SEPA threshold determination, an environmental impact statement (EIS), or any further review under SEPA.
B. Being designated a planned action means that a proposed project has been reviewed in accordance with this chapter, and found to be consistent with the development parameters and environmental analysis included in the EIS documents.
C. Planned actions will not be subject to further procedural review under SEPA. However, projects may be subject to conditions designed to mitigate any environmental impacts which may result from the project proposal, and projects will be subject to whatever permit requirements are deemed appropriate by the city under state and city laws and ordinances. The planned action designation shall not excuse a project from meeting the city’s code and ordinance requirements apart from the SEPA process. (Ord. 6382 § 2, 2011.)

18.08.070 Planned action permit process.
The director shall establish a procedure to review projects and determine whether they meet the planned action criteria, and establishing minimum application and notice requirements. The procedure shall consist, at a minimum, of the following:
A. Developments shall meet the requirements of ACC Titles 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Application shall be made on the forms provided by the city and shall include a SEPA checklist (where approved through WAC 197-11-315(2)) or such other environmental review forms provided by the city.
B. The director shall determine if the application is complete as provided in Chapter 14.06 ACC.
C. If the project is within the area designated as a planned action, the application shall be reviewed to determine if it is consistent with all of the requirements in this chapter.
D. When a complete application for development has been determined by the city to qualify as a planned action, the director shall notify the applicant and the project shall proceed in accordance with the appropriate permit procedure, with the exception that no additional SEPA review, threshold determination, or EIS shall be required.
E. Public notice for project qualifying as planned actions shall be tied to the underlying permit. If notice is otherwise required for the underlying permit, the notice shall state that the project has qualified as a planned action. If notice is not otherwise required for the underlying permit, no special notice is required.
F. If a project is determined to not qualify as a planned action, the director shall so notify the applicant and the SEPA responsible official, and shall prescribe a SEPA review procedure consistent with the city’s SEPA regulations and the requirements of state law. (Ord. 6382 § 2, 2011.)

18.08.080 Planned action mitigation measures.
The planned action mitigation measures set forth in the Exhibit 1 attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and incorporated herein by this reference shall apply to the project identified therein. This Exhibit 1 shall not be codified with the provisions of this chapter, but shall be on file and available for review in the office of the city clerk. (Ord. 6382 § 2, 2011.)

18.08.090 Amendments.

18.21.020    West Hill overlay.
18.21.030    Urban separator overlay.

18.21.010 Lea Hill overlay.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for additional development standards to address the area commonly referred to as the Lea Hill annexation area, as annexed under city of Auburn Ordinance Nos. 5346 and 6121, and identified on the city of Auburn comprehensive zoning map. While the intent is that the development standards for zones in the Lea Hill annexation area will be similar to (if not the same as) corresponding zones in other areas of the city, some variations are needed to recognize previous development allowed by King County zoning. Unless otherwise provided for in this section, all other provisions and requirements of this title shall apply to properties within the Lea Hill overlay.
B. Development Standards – Lots Previously Approved.
    1. For any residential lot that had received final plat approval, final short plat approval, or preliminary plat approval or that King County had received and determined the application complete for a preliminary plat or short plat, prior to the effective date of annexation into the city of Auburn, the development standards in the following table shall apply. The property owner/applicant shall be responsible to provide to the city evidence of these previous approvals.
    2. Any further subdivision of any lot and its subsequent use must conform to the permitted uses and standards referenced in the applicable zoning chapters of this title, except as modified by this section. For farm animals, subsection E of this section or ACC 18.31.220 shall apply.

    *Garages and other similar structures with a vehicular access require a 20-foot setback from any street.
C. Prior King County Approvals. The city of Auburn will recognize the terms of any King County-approved plat, PUD, conditional use permit, contract rezone or similar contractual obligations that may have been approved prior to the effective date of the annexation of the subject property. The conditions of any project that was approved by King County shall be required to be fulfilled in the city of Auburn.
D. Planning Director Authorization. The planning director shall be authorized to interpret the language of any King County permit, plat or condition thereof and effectuate the implementation of same to the fullest extent possible. If there is a conflict between a previous King County approval and the Auburn regulation then the most restrictive provision shall apply as determined by the planning director.
E. Farm Animals. 
    1. For properties greater than an acre in the R-1, R-5 and R-7 zones, it is permissible to keep farm animals (excluding goats and swine in the R-5 and R-7 zones); provided, there shall not be more than one horse, cow, donkey or other similar large animal, or four small animals such as sheep, or 12 poultry, rabbits, or similar size animals per each acre of enclosed usable pasture or roaming area. This acreage requirement is in addition to the minimum lot size requirements of the zone. Property owners of more than an acre in the Lea Hill overlay may choose to apply these standards or the standards in ACC 18.31.220.
    2. Shelters provided for farm animals shall be constructed no closer than 50 feet from any adjoining lot and shall be 100 feet from any public street or alley. Any corral, exercise yard, or arena shall maintain a distance of 35 feet from any property line. This excludes pasture area.
    3. For those properties that do not meet the requirements of subsection (E)(1) of this section, and farm animals were present prior to annexation, the farm animals may remain as legal nonconforming uses. In such case the number of farm animals allowed may be the same as what the county zoning provisions had allowed prior to the effective date of the annexation of the subject property.
F. Lot Averaging – R-1 Zone. It may be possible to subdivide land in the R-1 zone into lots smaller than 35,000 square feet if the property has a significant amount of nonbuildable land due to steep slopes, wetlands or similar features that would be in the public’s best interest to maintain. The following regulations shall apply in situations where lot averaging is permitted or required:
    1. At least 50 percent of the subdivision must be set aside as open space. Critical areas (i.e., steep slopes, wetlands) can count towards the 50 percent requirement. Maintenance of the open space tract or easement shall be the responsibility of the property owner and/or a homeowners’ association.
    2. The number of allowable lots in a subdivision shall be determined by multiplying the total number of acres in the subdivision by one. Any fraction shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with one-half being rounded up.
    3. The minimum size of any lot shall be 8,000 square feet. For lots less than 35,000 square feet, the minimum lot width shall be consistent with the requirements of the R-5 zone (Chapter 18.07 ACC). All other applicable development standards related to the R-1 zone will continue to apply.
    4. Lots within the subdivision shall be clustered so as to provide for continuity of open space within the subdivision and, where possible, with adjoining parcels.
    5. Each lot within a subdivision shall illustrate a building area within which the house, accessory structures, and parking areas shall be constructed. The building area shall be exclusive of setbacks, nonbuildable areas or any required buffers from the nonbuildable areas. Any preliminary plat, final plat or short plat shall illustrate the building area for each lot. Any future construction will be limited to the identified building area.
    6. A native growth protection easement or similar device, which may include provisions for the limited removal of vegetation and passive use of the easement, that perpetually protects the nonbuildable areas must be recorded with the final plat or short plat.
G. All marijuana related businesses and marijuana cooperatives are prohibited land uses within the Lea Hill overlay. (Ord. 6642 § 6, 2017; Ord. 6369 § 3, 2011; Ord. 6245 § 13, 2009.)

18.21.020 West Hill overlay.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for additional development standards to address the area commonly referred to as the West Hill annexation area, as annexed under city of Auburn Ordinance No. 6122 and identified on the city of Auburn comprehensive zoning map. While the intent is that the development standards for zones in the West Hill annexation area will be similar to (if not the same as) corresponding zones in other areas of the city, some variations are needed to recognize previous development allowed by King County zoning. Unless otherwise provided for in this section, all other provisions and requirements of this title shall apply to properties within the West Hill overlay.
B. Development Standards – Lots Previously Approved.
    1. For any residential lot that had received final plat approval, final short plat approval, preliminary plat approval or that King County had received and determined the application complete for a preliminary plat or short plat, prior to the effective date of annexation, the development standards in the following table shall apply. The property owner/applicant shall be responsible to provide evidence of these previous approvals/decisions.
    2. Any further subdivision of any lot and its subsequent use must conform to the permitted uses and standards referenced in the applicable zoning chapters of this title, except as modified by this section. For farm animals, subsection E of this section or ACC 18.31.220 shall apply.

E. Farm Animals. 
    1. For properties greater than an acre in the R-1, R-5 and R-7 zones within the West Hill overlay, it is permissible to keep farm animals (excluding goats and swine in the R-5 and R-7 zones); provided, there shall not be more than one horse, cow, donkey or other similar large animal, or four small animals such as sheep, or 12 poultry, rabbits, or similar size animals per each acre of enclosed usable pasture or roaming area. This acreage requirement is in addition to the minimum lot size requirements of the applicable zone. Property owners of more than an acre in the West Hill overlay district may choose to apply these standards, or the standards in ACC 18.31.220.
    2. Shelters provided for farm animals shall be constructed no closer than 50 feet from any adjoining lot and no closer than 100 feet from any public street or alley. Any corral, exercise yard, or arena shall maintain a distance of 35 feet from any property line. This excludes pasture areas.
    3. For those properties that do not meet the requirements of subsection (E)(1) of this section, and farm animals were present prior to annexation, the farm animals may remain as legal nonconforming uses. In such case, the number of farm animals allowed may be the same as what the county zoning provisions had allowed prior to the effective date of the annexation of the subject property.
F. All marijuana related businesses and marijuana cooperatives are prohibited land uses within the West Hill overlay. (Ord. 6642 § 7, 2017; Ord. 6369 § 4, 2011; Ord. 6245 § 13, 2009.)

18.21.030 Urban separator overlay.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for additional development standards to address the area designated as urban separator in the city’s comprehensive plan, as prescribed in the interlocal agreement between the city and King County approved under city of Auburn Resolution No. 4113 and identified on the city of Auburn comprehensive land use map. Unless otherwise provided for in this section, all other provisions and requirements of this title shall apply to properties within the urban separator overlay.
B. Development Standards. For property located within a designated urban separator, lot averaging shall be required. The regulations of ACC 18.21.010(F) shall apply in situations where lot averaging is used.
C. All marijuana related businesses and marijuana cooperatives are prohibited land uses within the urban separator overlay. (Ord. 6642 § 8, 2017; Ord. 6245 § 13, 2009.)

Chapter 18.23 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES

Sections:
18.23.010    Purpose.
18.23.020    Intent of commercial and industrial zones.
18.23.030    Uses.
18.23.040    Development standards.
18.23.050    Additional development standards for C-2, central business zone.
18.23.060    Additional development standards for the ep, environmental park zone.

18.23.010 Purpose.
This chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the commercial and industrial zones established by ACC 18.02.070 (Establishment of zones), determines the type of land use approval required for each use, and provides basic and additional development standards for sites, buildings, and associated improvements. (Ord. 6433 § 26, 2012.)

18.23.020 Intent of commercial and industrial zones.
A. General. This section describes the intent for each of the city’s commercial and industrial zones. These intent statements are to be used to guide the interpretation of the regulations associated with each zone. The planning director is authorized to make interpretations of these regulations based on his/her analysis of them together with clear and objective reasons for such interpretation.
B. C-N, Neighborhood Shopping Center Zone. The C-N zone is intended to provide areas appropriate for neighborhood shopping establishments which provide limited retail business, service and office facilities for the convenience of residents of the neighborhood. A neighborhood shopping center is designed and located so as to minimize traffic congestion on public highways and streets in its vicinity and to best fit the general land use pattern of the area to be served by the center. The protective standards contained in this chapter are intended to minimize any adverse effect of the neighborhood shopping center on nearby property values and to provide for safe and efficient use of the neighborhood shopping center itself.
C. C-1, Light Commercial Zone. The C-1 zone is intended for lower intensity commercial adjacent to residential neighborhoods. This zone generally serves as a transition zone between higher and lower intensity land uses, providing retail and professional services. This zone represents the primary commercial designation for small – to moderate-scale commercial activities compatible by having similar performance standards and should be developed in a manner which is consistent with and attracts pedestrian-oriented activities. This zone encourages leisure shopping and provides amenities conducive to attracting shoppers and pedestrians.
D. C-2 Central Business District Zone. The intent of the C-2 zone is to set apart the portion of the city proximate to the center for financial, commercial, governmental, professional, and cultural activities. Uses in the C-2 zone have common or similar performance standards in that they represent types of enterprises involving the rendering of services, both professional or to the person, or on-premises retail activities. This zone encourages and provides amenities conducive to attracting pedestrians.
E. C-3, Heavy Commercial Zone. The intent of the C-3 zone is to allow for medium to high intensity uses consisting of a wide range of retail, commercial, entertainment, office, services, and professional uses. This zone is intended to accommodate uses which are oriented to automobiles either as a mode or target of the commercial service while fostering a pedestrian orientation. The uses allowed can include outside activities, display, fabrication or service features when not the predominant portion of the use. The uses enumerated in this classification have potential for impacts to surrounding properties and street systems than those uses permitted in the more restrictive commercial classifications.
F. C-4, Mixed-Use Commercial Zone. The intent of the C-4 zone is to provide for a pedestrian-oriented mix of retail, office, and limited multiple-family residential uses. This classification is also intended to allow flexibility in design and the combination of uses that is responsive to market demands. The uses enumerated in this classification anticipate a mix of multiple-family residential, retail, and office uses that are coordinated through a site-specific planning process. The multiple-family residential must be located in a multi-story building; the ground floor of which must contain a permitted use or combination of uses, other than parking, as listed in this chapter. Certain heavy commercial uses permitted in other commercial classifications are not permitted in this zone because of the potential for conflicts with multifamily residential uses, in order to achieve a quality of environment that is conducive to this mix of uses.
G. M-1, Light Industrial Zone. The intent of the M-1 zone is to accommodate a variety of industrial, commercial, and limited residential uses in an industrial park environment, to preserve land primarily for light industrial and commercial uses, to implement the economic goals of the comprehensive plan and to provide a greater flexibility within the zoning regulations for those uses which are non-nuisance in terms of air and water pollution, noise, vibration, glare or odor. The light industrial/commercial character of this zone is intended to address the way in which industrial and commercial uses are carried out rather than the actual types of products made.
The character of this zone will limit the type of primary activities which may be conducted outside of enclosed buildings to outdoor displays and sales. Uses which are not customarily conducted indoors or involve hazardous materials are considered heavy industrial uses under this title and are not appropriate for the M-1 zone. An essential aspect of this zone is the need to maintain a quality of development that attracts rather than discourages further investment in light industrial and commercial development. Consequently, site activities which could distract from the visual quality of development of those areas, such as outdoor storage, should be strictly regulated within this zone.
H. EP, Environmental Park Zone. The environmental park district is intended to allow uses in proximity to the Auburn Environmental Park that benefit from that location and will complement the park and its environmental focus. Uses allowed in this zone will focus upon medical, biotech and “green” technologies including energy conservation, engineering, water quality and similar uses. Other uses complementary to and supporting these uses are also allowed. Incorporation of sustainable design and green building practices will be a primary aspect of this zone. The construction of leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) and built green certified buildings is encouraged and built green will be required for multiple-family dwellings. The city recognizes that much of the property in this zone was developed under earlier standards, so the goals of the district will be realized over a period of time as properties are redeveloped.
I. M-2, Heavy Industrial Zone. The M-2 zone is intended to accommodate a broad range of manufacturing and industrial uses. Permitted activity may vary from medium to higher intensity uses that involve the manufacture, fabrication, assembly, or processing of raw and/or finished materials. Heavy industrial uses should not be located near residential development.
While other uses may be sited within this zone, permits for such uses should not be issued if such uses will discourage use of adjacent sites for heavy industry, interrupt the continuity of industrial sites, or produce traffic in conflict with the industrial uses. (Ord. 6433 § 26, 2012.)

18.23.030 Uses.
A. General Permit Requirements. Table 18.23.030 identifies the uses of land allowed in each commercial and industrial zone and the land use approval process required to establish each use.
B. Requirements for Certain Specific Land Uses. Where the last column in Table 18.23.030 (“Standards for Specific Land Uses”) includes a reference to a code section number, the referenced section determines other requirements and standards applicable to the use regardless of whether it is permitted outright or requires an administrative or conditional use permit.

Notes: 
1A 25-foot setback is required when adjacent to a residential zone.
2Buildings may exceed 45 feet if one foot of setback is provided from each property line (or required minimum setback) for each foot the building exceeds 45 feet.
(Ord. 6433 § 26, 2012.)

18.23.050 Additional development standards for C-2, central business zone.
A. Maximum Building Height.
    1. The maximum height of that portion of a building that abuts a street(s) shall be no higher than the right-of-way width of the abutting street(s). Building height may increase; provided, that the building is stepped back one foot (from the abutting street right(s)-of-way) for each foot of increased building height.
    2. If the building abuts more than one street and the abutting streets have different right-of-way widths, then the height of the building allowed at any street frontage shall be the average of the abutting street right-of-way widths.
    3. The following rooftop features may extend up to 15 feet above the maximum height limit: stair towers, elevator penthouses, and screened mechanical equipment.
B. Minimum setbacks: none required, see subsection D of this section for specific building orientation requirements.
C. Fences shall be decorative and relate architecturally to the associated building. Acceptable materials are brick, wood, stone, metal, or textured concrete. Typical galvanized wire mesh (chain link), barbed wire or razor wire are not permitted. For further information see Chapter 18.31 ACC.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to temporary fences required during construction projects permitted by the city.
D. Building Orientation Requirements. The following requirements apply to the construction of all new buildings or structures:
    1. Existing buildings or structures, including facades, that do not have setbacks or otherwise cannot comply are exempt from these requirements regardless of the amount of improvements made to the building, structure or facade as long as any alteration does not make the existing facade more nonconforming.
    2. Existing buildings, structures, or facades that are set back and within 20 feet of a street shall comply to the fullest extent possible as determined by the planning director, with the following requirements when any cumulative structural improvements are made that exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the existing building, structure, or facade.
    3. Any addition to an existing building, regardless of value, that will be within 20 feet of a street shall also comply to the fullest extent possible, as determined by the planning director, with the following requirements.
        a. For each lineal foot of frontage a building has on a street, there shall be provided an area(s) for pedestrian amenities at the rate of one square foot of ground area for each lineal foot of building frontage. Pedestrian amenities shall consist of such features as landscaping, benches, entryways with accents such as brick pavers, artwork, or a combination of these or similar features. The pedestrian amenities shall be located on the property between the street right-of-way and the building. The planning director shall approve the amount and type of the pedestrian amenities.
        b. For buildings that have a street frontage that exceeds 50 feet, then at least 25 percent of the building’s frontage shall be immediately adjacent to the street right-of-way.
        c. For buildings that have a street frontage that is less than 25 feet, then no pedestrian amenities will be required and the building may be located at the property line. There shall, however, be provided a landing in front of each door that opens to a street that is large enough such that no part of any door will encroach into the street right-of-way when the door is being opened or closed.
        d. For buildings that provide additional setbacks, except as restricted by subsection (D)(3)(b) of this section, the area between the street right-of-way and the building shall only contain pedestrian amenities.
        e. If a building has more than two street frontages, then at least two of the frontages shall comply with subsections (D)(3)(b) and (g) of this section and contain pedestrian amenities between the building and the street right-of-way. Any remaining frontages shall either have pedestrian amenities, windows, murals, flat surfaced artwork or other similar architectural features that would avoid large blank walls.
        f. For new buildings that will infill between two other existing buildings, the new building shall be set back no further than either of the adjacent buildings unless additional setback is required to comply with subsection (D)(3)(a) of this section. The proposed setback shall be reviewed by the planning director to ensure the setback will maintain building continuity along the street.
        g. Buildings shall have windows that encompass at least 60 percent of the first floor facade and at least 40 percent of the facade of each additional floor. At least 50 percent of the area of the first floor windows of nonresidential buildings shall provide visibility to the inside of the building. This subsection shall only apply to the facades of new buildings with street frontage and shall not lessen the requirements of the Uniform Building or Fire Codes.
        h. The building’s principal pedestrian entrance shall be oriented to the street. If the building is at a corner, either street or alley, then the principal pedestrian entrance shall be at the corner unless a better architectural design is attained at another location and approved by the planning director.
        i. Buildings that are at the intersection of either two streets or a street and an alley shall provide for a sight distance triangular setback as required by Chapter 18.31 ACC. These triangular areas may contain pedestrian amenities that satisfy the requirements of subsection (D)(3)(a) of this section.
        j. A site plan shall be prepared by the proponent which addresses compliance with the requirements as outlined in subsections (D)(3)(a) through (i) of this section. The site plan shall be approved by the planning director prior to the submittal of any building permit.
        k. For the sole purposes of this subsection D the term “street” shall include the right-of-way of private and public streets. The term shall also include pedestrian walkways, encumbered by an easement or similar means, that are used by the general public to travel from one property to another.
E. Mechanical equipment on rooftops shall be sited and designed to minimize noise and effectively screen the equipment from view from adjacent properties and rights-of-way. The following methods, or a combination thereof, may be used:
    1. Set back from the roof edge to obscure visibility from below;
    2. Integration into the building architecture, using building walls, roof wells or roof parapets to conceal the equipment;
    3. Equipment enclosure or sight-obscuring fencing or landscaping;
    4. Overhead trellis or roof to obscure visibility from above.
Materials used to screen mechanical equipment shall be the same as or compatible with the design of the principal structure.
F. Stair towers and elevator penthouses shall be designed to be architecturally integrated into the principal structure. This may include using the same building materials, repeating common building forms, colors or elements, or incorporating the roof and wall of the stair tower or elevator penthouse into the upper wall of the structure. (Ord. 6433 § 26, 2012.)

18.23.060 Additional development standards for the ep, environmental park zone.
A. Fences and Hedges. Fences shall be decorative and relate architecturally to the associated building. Acceptable materials are brick, wood, stone, metal, or textured concrete. Colored chain link fences may be allowed subject to the planning director’s approval. Barbed wire or razor wire fences are not permitted. For further information on fencing see ACC 18.31.020. The provisions of this section shall not apply to temporary fences during construction projects permitted by the city.
B. Loading and unloading docks shall not be visible from the street.
C. Mechanical equipment on rooftops shall be sited and designed to minimize noise and effectively screen the equipment from view from adjacent properties and rights-of-way. The following methods, or a combination thereof, may be used:
    1. Set back from the roof edge to obscure visibility from below;
    2. Integration into the building architecture, using building walls, roof wells or roof parapets to conceal the equipment;
    3. Equipment enclosure or sight-obscuring fencing or landscaping;
    4. Overhead trellis or roof to obscure visibility from above.
Materials used to screen mechanical equipment shall be the same as or compatible with the design of the principal structure. (Ord. 6433 § 26, 2012.)

Sections:
18.25.010    Purpose and intent.
18.25.020    Applicability.
18.25.030    Procedures.
18.25.040    Infill residential standards.

18.25.010 Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to encourage the development of underutilized parcels in zones which, through Auburn comprehensive plan goals and policies, have been identified as areas where infill residential development should be encouraged. This chapter identifies conditions under which infill development is supported and relaxes certain development requirements in those instances in an effort to promote the construction of infill development in appropriate areas of the city. (Ord. 6245 § 14, 2009.)

18.25.020 Applicability.
A. Eligibility Criteria. This chapter may be applied to development or redevelopment that meets all of the following criteria:
    1. The lot is within one of the following zones: R-5, R-7, R-10, R-16, or R-20.
    2. Adjacent properties abutting at least 50 percent of the nonstreet perimeter of the subject property (i.e., side and/or rear lot lines) are developed with single-family dwellings or higher intensity uses.
    3. For lots located in the R-5 or R-7 zones, the development or redevelopment creates a maximum of one new lot or dwelling unit.
    4. For properties located in the R-10, R-16, or R-20 zones, the lot or parcel size shall be one acre or less. (Ord. 6245 § 14, 2009.)

18.25.030 Procedures.
Development proposals desiring to utilize the infill standards of this chapter shall be subject to one or more of the permit types found in ACC Title 14 and shall be processed in a manner consistent with the underlying land use application pursuant to ACC Title 14. (Ord. 6245 § 14, 2009.)

18.25.040 Infill residential standards.
A. All other provisions of this title that would apply to a non-infill project shall apply to infill development except as specifically modified by this chapter.
B. Infill Land Division Standards – Reduction in Dimensional Requirements for Infill Residential Development. Notwithstanding the dimensional development standard requirements found in the underlying residential zones of ACC 18.07.030, property that is eligible for infill residential development pursuant to ACC 18.25.020 shall be eligible for subdivision of land as follows:
    1. Minimum Lot Area. Minimum lot area and minimum average lot area may be permitted at 80 percent of the minimum areas required in Chapter 18.07 ACC for the underlying zone.
    2. Minimum Lot Width. Minimum lot width may be reduced by 20 percent of or 10 feet less than the required minimum lot width of the underlying zone, whichever is less.
    3. Maximum Lot Coverage. Maximum lot coverage can be increased by 10 percent over that allowed in the underlying zone.
C. Infill Development Standards. Property that is eligible for infill residential development pursuant to ACC 18.25.020 shall be eligible for these additional development standards to encourage infill, subject to demonstration to the satisfaction of the city engineer that all required utility infrastructure, access requirements, and street elements can be accommodated in accordance with the city design and construction standards:
    1. The maximum density provided for in Chapter 18.07 ACC may be increased by up to 10 percent. This density bonus may not be combined with density bonuses provided for under Chapter 18.49 ACC.
    2. Increased allowable building height by no more than five feet to allow for roof features noted in subsection (D)(4) of this section while achieving permitted maximum density.
    3. Reduced front or street side setbacks to conform to the average existing building lines or setbacks of adjoining structures. In no case shall reduced street setbacks be allowed for a garage or carport.
    4. Alternative setbacks, including reduced rear setbacks. Standard setbacks of the zone shall be applied for any required setback when the subject setback abuts an RC, R-1, R-5, or R-7 zone.
    5. A 10 percent reduction in minimum on-site parking requirements, when on-site parking is designed to be shared parking. This reduction may be combined with any other reduction provided for in ACC 18.52.030.
D. Infill Design Standards. Property that is eligible for infill residential development pursuant to ACC 18.25.020 shall adhere to the following design requirements. While creativity and variation in architectural design is encouraged, the purpose of these requirements is to ensure compatibility of infill development with the character of nearby existing residential structures.
Residential infill development shall meet the following design criteria, as defined by the predominant character of the existing residential block face. The block face shall consist of all residential properties along both sides of the public or private right-of-way on which the development fronts. The block face shall be measured from intersection to intersection, to the road end, or 200 feet in either direction from the development site, whichever is nearest.
    1. Building orientation on infill lots shall match the predominant orientation of other buildings along the block face.
    2. Access and location of off-street parking on infill lots shall be similar to the predominant character for existing development along the block face. Primary vehicular access shall be through rear alleys where such rights-of-way exist, and on-site parking shall be located to the rear of proposed structures, insofar as this is consistent with the predominant character of the block face.
    3. Proposed residences shall be required to provide an additional five-foot setback over that required in the underlying zone above the second story where property line(s) abut a property with an existing single-story structure.
    4. Roofs on proposed infill residential structures shall be similar in slope, material, and style to existing development and shall incorporate any or all of the following features, insofar as such features are compatible with existing development on the block face:
        a. Dormers;
        b. Gabled or hipped roofs;
        c. Pitched roofs;
        d. Parapets or cornices.
    Unless it is the predominant existing style on the block face, flat, unadorned roofs shall not be allowed.
    5. Horizontal facades longer than 25 feet shall be treated to reduce building mass and visual bulk using at least one of the following techniques. The applicant shall demonstrate that the selected techniques are either currently present on the block face or are not substantially incompatible with existing development.
        a. Bays or recesses (minimum depth of 18 inches);
        b. Window patterns;
        c. Contrasting materials or colors;
        d. Upper story setbacks;
        e. Balconies. (Ord. 6245 § 14, 2009.)

18.29.010 Intent.
The downtown urban center zone is intended to create a distinct and strong identity for downtown Auburn by establishing land use and design standards for review of development proposals within the core area of the city of Auburn’s designated urban center, in order to implement the city of Auburn downtown plan and the goals, policies and objectives of the Auburn comprehensive plan. This zone is intended to produce a concentration and mixture of commercial, office, medical, retail, residential and civic uses within the downtown area; to encourage private and public investment, attract shoppers and visitors, and appeal to existing and new residents; to provide a development pattern that supports pedestrian movement, bicycles and use of public transit; and to provide opportunities to increase the city’s tax base, thereby helping to fund public improvements and public services. (Ord. 6071 § 6 (Exh. A), 2007.)

18.29.020 Scope.
A. The downtown urban center zone may be applied to any property designated as “Downtown” on the Auburn comprehensive plan map.
B. Site plan and building design review and approval shall be required for all public and private development activities requiring permits within the downtown urban center zone unless exempted under subsection C of this section. The planning and development director is given the authority to require building design and site plans consistent with the design standards contained or referenced herein and to require revisions as necessary in order to ensure development is consistent with the purpose of this chapter.
C. The following activities, as determined by the director, shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter if the property has frontage on a pedestrian street as defined in the downtown urban center design standards:
    1. Interior alterations that do not alter the exterior appearance of a structure or modify an existing site condition;
    2. Normal or routine building and site maintenance/repair that is exempt from permit requirements; and
    3. Any remodeling or expansion of existing single-family residences with no change in use or addition of dwelling units involved.
D. The following activities, as determined by the director, shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter if the property does not have frontage on a pedestrian street as defined in the downtown urban center design standards:
    1. Interior alterations that do not alter the exterior appearance of a structure or modify an existing site condition;
    2. Site and exterior alterations that do not exceed 10 percent of the assessed valuation of the property (building or land) per the most recent county records;
    3. Building additions that are less than 10 percent of the existing floor area of the existing building(s). Any cumulative floor area increase (from the adoption date of the ordinance codified in this chapter) that totals more than 10 percent shall not be exempt; unless the director determines compliance with these standards would be unfeasible and/or unreasonable;
    4. Normal or routine building and site maintenance/repair that is exempt from permit requirements;

The siting of microcells shall be in accordance with siting of microcells found in ACC 18.31.110.
A. Types of Wireless Communication Facilities (WCFs). For the purposes of determining in which zones wireless communications facilities are to be permitted, they will be classified pursuant to the following types. Refer to the table in subsection L of this section to determine which zones allow for the following types of facilities:
    1. Type 1. Type 1 are new antennas erected on existing buildings or nonresidential structures. There are four separate Type 1 categories described as follows:
        a. 1-A. The combined height of the antenna together with the height of the existing building cannot be 25 percent greater than the existing building or exceed the height limitation of the zone in which the building is located.
        b. 1-B. The combined height of the antenna together with the height of the existing building cannot be 50 percent greater than the existing building or exceed the height limitation of the zone in which the building is located.
        c. 1-C. The combined height of the antenna together with the height of the existing building is 50 percent greater than the existing building or exceeds the height limitation of the zone in which the building is located. The height limitation of the zone can only be exceeded by 25 percent.
        d. 1-D. Antenna located on existing water towers, athletic field light poles, or similar public utility infrastructure not located within public street right-of-way. The height limitation of the WCF will be 10 percent of the existing structure height, but may be increased to a maximum of 20 percent with an administrative use permit and may be increased to a maximum of 30 percent with a conditional use permit. The height limitation of the zone may be exceeded relative to the above provisions allowed for a 1-D facility.
    2. Type 2. Type 2 are new antennas erected on existing (primary) support structures that have previous city approvals. There are two separate Type 2 categories described as follows:
        a. 2-A. Must meet height requirements of previous approval and is limited to 50 percent total (cumulative) expansion of equipment area.
        b. 2-B. Has greater height requirements than previous approval and allows for more than a 50 percent expansion of the equipment area.
    3. Type 3. Type 3 is the erection of new (primary) support structures. There are three separate Type 3 categories described as follows:
        a. 3-A. Monopoles that are 75 feet or less in height.
        b. 3-B. Monopoles that are more than 75 feet in height or lattice towers of any height.
        c. 3-C. Monopoles or lattice towers that meet the definition of an EWCF and are 185 feet or less in structure height.
    4. Type 4. Type 4 are new antennas erected on existing EWCF (primary) support structures that have previous city approvals. There is one Type 4 category, which is described as follows:
        a. 4-A. Mounting of antennas cannot exceed the following thresholds:1
            i. Increase the height of an existing primary support structure by 10 percent, or 20 feet (whichever is less).
            ii. Add an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the outside edge of the tower more than 20 feet.
            iii. Install more than four ancillary equipment facilities.
        1This section is intended to be interpreted consistent with 47 CFR 1.40001, as amended.
B. Separation between Facilities. 
    1. New, Freestanding Primary Support Structures. 
        a. The minimum separation, i.e., distance, between a proposed monopole (that is 75 feet or less in height) and any other existing primary support structure, of any height, shall be the height of the proposed monopole, including antenna, multiplied by a factor of 10.
        b. The minimum separation, i.e., distance, between a proposed monopole (that is more than 75 feet in height, or lattice towers of any height) and any other existing primary support structure, of any height, shall be the height of the proposed monopole, including antenna, multiplied by a factor of 20.
    2. The distance between primary support structures shall be measured by following a straight line, without regard to intervening buildings, from the base of one support structure to the base of the other support structure(s).
    3. A primary support structure would be considered “existing” if a conditional use permit or administrative use permit has been issued and is still valid for sites which have not been built upon.
C. Co-Location Requirements. 
    1. For monopoles that are more than 75 feet in height and lattice towers of any height (Type 3-B facilities), the owner of the property shall execute and provide evidence of a nonexclusive lease with the carrier that allows for other carriers to place antennas on the structure.
    2. Any application for a Type 3-B or 3-C facility shall include technical justification that an existing Type 3-B or 3-C facility with a nonexclusive lease could not be used instead of constructing a new tower.
D. Height. 
    1. Unless otherwise provided for, the height of any primary support structure and/or antenna shall not exceed the height limitations of the zone.
    2. The maximum height of any primary support structure shall not exceed 120 feet.
    3. There shall be no variances allowed to the height limitations.
    4. The carrier shall provide evidence that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the location of a primary support structure relative to the Auburn Municipal Airport.
    5. Unless otherwise restricted by this section, building- or structure-mounted antennas may extend a maximum of 15 feet above the maximum height permitted for structures within the zone.
    6. Antennas that are mounted on structures that do not otherwise have a height restriction may be allowed to increase the overall height of the structure by no more than 10 percent of the height of the structure unless additional approvals are obtained.
E. Setbacks. 
    1. All equipment shelters, cabinets, support structures or other above-ground facilities shall meet the setback requirements of the zone in which located except as follows. All equipment shelters, cabinets, or other above-ground facilities used to support primary support structures shall be set back the same distance required of the primary support structure. All equipment shelters, cabinets, or other above-ground facilities within a nonresidential zone shall be set back a minimum of 50 feet from any adjacent R zone.
    2. The minimum distance from any primary support structure, of any height, to any residentially zoned parcel of property shall be a distance equal to the overall height of the primary support structure (including antennas) multiplied by a factor of two.
    3. Where possible, roof-mounted antennas and equipment shelters and/or cabinets are to be placed towards the center of the building, or away from public views. Equipment shelters and/or cabinets shall be screened by a parapet or similar architectural feature.
F. Fencing and Landscaping. 
    1. Fencing. Fencing is required to enclose all above-ground support equipment that is associated with primary support structures. Fencing will be 100 percent sight-obscuring, as defined in ACC 18.31.020(C)(2), if visible from a public right-of-way or less intense zone. Equipment shelters and/or cabinets shall be enclosed by fencing a minimum of six feet in height. Fencing shall meet the sight distance requirements of the city design and construction standards.
    2. Landscaping. 
        a. Where above-ground support equipment is visible from a public right-of-way, a minimum width of five feet of Type II landscaping as defined in ACC 18.50.040 will be provided on the exterior of the enclosing fence in order to effectively screen the equipment from the public right-of-way. Landscaping shall meet the sight distance requirements of the city design and construction standards.
        b. Where facilities are visible from adjacent residential uses, a minimum width of five feet of Type I landscaping as defined in ACC 18.50.040 will be provided on the exterior of the enclosing fence in order to effectively screen the equipment from the adjacent residential uses.
        c. Existing on-site vegetation may be used to meet the landscape requirements if approved by the planning director.
G. Aesthetics. 
    1. In order to minimize any potential negative aesthetic impacts from new primary support structures including protecting views to and from residential neighborhoods, mitigation may be required to blend the facilities in with the adjacent development or environs. Typical solutions for the support structure might include: an extension of the building, a component of a sign structure, disguising the facility as a tree, planting of tall trees, moving the location of the facility, painting or texturing the facility, etc.
    2. Building- or roof-mounted antennas will be painted or textured to blend with the adjacent surfaces.
    3. No lettering, symbols, images or trademarks large enough to be legible to occupants of vehicular traffic on any adjacent street shall be placed on or affixed to any part of the WCF, unless required by the FCC or FAA.
    4. Except as specifically required by the FAA (but must be approved by the city), freestanding primary support structures shall be painted a color that best allows them to blend into the surroundings. The use of grays, blues and greens might be appropriate; however, each application shall be evaluated individually.
H. Lighting. 
    1. Freestanding support structures shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. Any proposed lighting shall be submitted at the time of the initial application. Any lighting must be reviewed and approved by the city.
    2. Security lighting used to light the equipment facility shall be directed downward, shielded and kept within the boundaries of the site.
I. Abandoned Facilities. 
    1. Any WCF which is not utilized for a period of nine months or more will be considered abandoned.
    2. Any WCF which falls into a state of disrepair as determined by the planning director will be considered abandoned.
    3. Any WCF considered to be abandoned must be removed completely within 90 days from the date of notification by the city’s code enforcement personnel. The code enforcement personnel may extend the 90-day period should a valid application for use of the facility be submitted to the city.
J. Noise. For the purposes of this section, WCF will be considered a Class B, commercial, noise source pursuant to WAC 173-60-040.
K. Supplemental Information Required for Applications. In addition to the information that is otherwise required for an application for a permit for a WCF, the following is also required:
    1. For a new primary support structure and related equipment, the applicant shall provide the carrier’s master network plan for the city showing the carrier’s existing WCF locations and narrative explaining the potential WCF locations over the next year, if known.

18.31.200 Architectural and site design review standards and regulations.
A. Intent and Purpose. The architectural and site design regulations provide an administrative review process for evaluating the design and arrangement of development. The architectural and site design regulations are intended to be consistent with and implement the policies of the comprehensive plan. The purposes of these design review regulations are to:
    1. Foster good decision-making for development through architectural and site design within the context of the community’s built and natural environmental character, scale and diversity;
    2. Promote the use of appropriate scale of buildings and the configuration of open space and parking areas for development to safely and comfortably accommodate pedestrian activities;
    3. Coordinate the interrelationship of buildings and public and private open space;
    4. Discourage monotony in building design and arrangement, while promoting harmony among distinct building identities; and
    5. Mitigate, through design and site plan measures, the visual impact of large building facades, particularly those which have high public visibility (encourage the creative use of architectural and landscape features in order to reduce the actual and perceived scale and bulk of structures).
B. Applicability. The following land uses, types of development activities, including all related site improvements, and geographic areas, are subject to the architectural and site design standards and the processes and regulations for conducting design review contained in this chapter:
    1. Multiple-Family and Mixed-Use Developments.

If any individual believes that his or her circumstances pose particular difficulty in meeting the 30-day timeframe for compliance with the setback requirements of this section, the individual may request in writing of the community development and public works director (planning director) or designee additional time to bring his or her activity into conformity. Decisions of the community development and public works director (planning director) or designee to grant or deny the extension shall be final and conclusive.

Chapter 18.35 SPECIAL PURPOSE ZONES

Sections:
18.35.010    Purpose.
18.35.020    Intent of special purpose zones.
18.35.030    Uses.
18.35.040    Development standards.
18.35.050    Additional development standards for both the RO and RO-H zones.

18.35.010 Purpose.
This chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the residential office, residential office-hospital, institutional, and public use zones established by ACC 18.02.070 (Establishment of zones), determines the type of land use approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size. (Ord. 6434 § 1, 2012.)

18.35.020 Intent of special purpose zones.
A. General. This section describes the intent for each of the city’s special purpose zones. These intent statements may be used to guide the interpretation of the regulations associated with each zone.
B. RO and RO-H Residential Office and Residential Office-Hospital Zone. The RO and RO-H are intended primarily to accommodate small-scale business and professional offices, medical and dental clinics, and banks and similar financial institutions at locations where they are compatible with residential uses. Some retail and personal services may be permitted if supplemental to the other uses allowed in the zone. This zone is intended for those areas that are in transition from residential to commercial uses along arterials or near the hospital. Conversion of residential uses to commercial uses is geared towards encouraging adaptive re-use of existing single-family structures that continue to appear in accord with the single-family residential character. The RO-H designation is to be used exclusively for the hospital area, located in the vicinity of 2nd Street NE and Auburn Avenue, and is intended to be used for medical and related uses and those uses compatible with the medical community.
C. P-1 Public Use Zone. The P-1 zone is intended to provide for the appropriate location and development of public uses that serve the cultural, educational, recreational, and public service needs of the community.
D. I Institutional Zone. The I zone is intended to provide an area wherein educational, governmental, theological, recreational, cultural and other public and quasi-public uses may be allowed to develop. It is further intended these areas be significant in scope which will allow a combination of uses which may not be permitted outright within other zones. This district is not intended to include those smaller or singular public uses which are consistent with and permitted in other zones.
E. OS Open Space Zone. The OS zone is intended to provide for land uses that tend to be managed in a largely undeveloped character, including passive parks, watersheds, natural and urban conservancy shoreline areas, significant wildlife habitats, large stormwater detention ponds or floodplain ponds, utility corridors with public access, and areas with significant development restrictions. Park lands included in the open space zone tend to be predominately passive in character and with relatively fewer developed facilities than parks included in the institutional zone. Private sites containing critical areas or shorelines may be included. (Ord. 6677 § 2, 2018; Ord. 6434 § 1, 2012.)

18.35.030 Uses.
A. General Permit Requirements. Table 18.35.030 identifies the uses of land allowed in each special purpose zone and the planning permit required to establish each use.
B. Requirements for Certain Specific Land Uses. Where the last column in Table 18.35.030 (“Standards for Specific Land Uses”) includes a section number, the referenced section determines other requirements and standards applicable to the use regardless of whether it is permitted outright or requires an administrative or conditional use permit.

18.36.010 Intent.
The purpose of the BP district is to respond to modern trends in business park development by providing a suitable area for industrial, professional office, service and commercial uses within a planned, well managed site with high quality development standards.
It is also the intent of this district to allow flexibility with regard to development standards and uses if the flexibility results in an atmosphere of superior architectural, site and landscape design.
This district may be applied to any site within the city designated as “region serving” in the comprehensive plan, which is zoned commercial or industrial. In addition, the comprehensive plan identifies specific locations appropriate for business park development. (Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.36.020 Process.
The approval process for business parks is in two steps. The first step in the conceptual approval of the business park, by the hearing examiner and city council, this step also approves the rezone to the business park district. The second step is the approval of the site plan by the planning director.
A. Conceptual Approval. 
    1. Conceptual approval of a business park shall be applied by the rezone process as specified in ACC 18.68.030(B)(1)(a). The rezone shall be a contract rezone and shall include an agreement that establishes the type, square footage and general location of the uses; the location and size of the park; restrictive covenants; public improvements; and the responsibilities of the owner/developer.
    2. A BP district shall only be approved when the owner/developer has demonstrated that a public benefit will result and the project contains architectural, site, and landscape design standards that are significantly superior to those typically required in the other industrial and commercial zones.
    3. No significant impacts on the public infrastructure shall occur that cannot be effectively mitigated by the development of the business park.
    4. If the approval of the business park requires a subdivision of property, the preliminary plat may be processed concurrently.
B. Site Plan Approval. 
    1. The site plan of a business park shall be approved by the planning director.
    2. From the date of filing a complete application the planning director shall within 30 calendar days either approve, deny, or approve with conditions the site plan. The decision of the director shall be final unless appealed to the hearing examiner pursuant to ACC 18.70.050.
    3. The city attorney shall prepare the necessary documents, approving the site plan, which shall be recorded at the appropriate King County office, for properties located in King County, or recorded at the appropriate Pierce county office for properties located in Pierce County. (Ord. 5170 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.36.030 Permitted uses.

18.38.010 Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to provide for the operation and management of the Auburn Municipal Airport. It is found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the municipal airport and of occupants of land or property in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the municipal airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared that:
A. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the municipal airport;
B. It is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and
C. The prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. It is further declared that both the prevention or the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.020 Permitted uses.
Hereafter all buildings, structures, or parcels of land shall only be used for the following, unless otherwise provided for in this title:
A. Landing, taking off and flying of aircraft, excluding ultralights as defined by ACC 8.36.010;
B. Businesses incidental to and necessary or convenient for airport operations, including offices, eating establishments, restrooms, hangars, shops for light repairs, gasoline and oil sales and accessory structures therefor;
C. Other uses as determined by the hearing examiner to be related to operation and use of the airport. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.030 Restricted uses.
Restricted uses shall be as follows: no use may be made of land within any airport zone in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, making it difficult for fliers using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity thereof, or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off or maneuvering of aircraft. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.040 Zones established generally.
In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the noninstrument approach zone, transition zone, horizontal zone, conical zone and obstacle free areas. Such areas and zones are shown on the “City of Auburn Municipal Airport Master Plan Update, 1993-2013, dated February 1995, and Federal Air Regulations (FAR) Part 77 as amended, which is on file in the city clerk’s office. The various zones are established and defined as follows in ACC 18.38.050 through 18.38.085. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.050 Approach zone.
A noninstrument approach surface is established at each end of all noninstrument runways for landings and takeoffs. The inner width of the approach surface is 250 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond the physical end of the runway, and it expands uniformly to a width of 1,250 feet. This approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet at a slope of twenty to one (20:1). The elevation of the inner width of the approach surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.060 Transitional zone.
The transitional surface extends outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extends at a slope of seven to one (7:1) from a line 125 feet from the runway centerline or runway end and from the sides of the approach surfaces. The elevation of the line 125 feet from the runway centerline or runway centerline extended for 200 feet beyond each runway end is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.070 Horizontal zone.
A horizontal surface is established above the airport. This horizontal surface is a plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs 5,000 feet in a radius from the center of each end of the primary surface of the runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The primary surface is longitudinally centered on the runway with a width of 250 feet and extends 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.080 Conical zone.
A conical surface is established which extends outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty to one (20:1) for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.085 Obstacle free area.
An area extending 250 feet either side of the runway and 600 feet off either end of the runway. The obstacle free area (OFA) must be kept clear of any structures, fencing, landscaping, parking, or vehicular circulation not directly related to aircraft operations at the Auburn Municipal Airport. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997.)

18.38.090 Height limitations – Generally.
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or maintained in any zone created in this chapter to a height in excess of the height limit established in ACC 18.38.100 through 18.38.130 for such zone. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.100 Height limitations – Noninstrument approach zone.
The height limitations for noninstrument approach surfaces begin at a point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the runway and extend for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet at a slope of twenty to one (20:1). (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.38.110 Height limitations – Transition zones.

18.46A.010 Intent.
A. It is the intent of this chapter to provide an administrative approval process whereby the city may permit uses to locate within the city on an interim basis without requiring full compliance with the development standards for the applicable zoning district, or by which the city may allow seasonal or transient uses not otherwise permitted.
B. It is not the intent of this chapter to provide a means to circumvent the strict application of the permitted uses as established elsewhere in this title for the city’s zoning districts. Time limits are to be strictly enforced, unless otherwise modified by the planning director or designee.
C. This chapter addresses only those temporary uses located on public or private property outside of public rights-of-way. Uses located in public rights-of-way shall be in accordance with ACC Title 12. (Ord. 6268 § 2, 2009.)

18.46A.020 Permit approval required.
A. For the purposes of this chapter, “temporary use” shall mean a short-term or interim activity or purpose for which land or premises or a building thereon is designed, arranged, intended, or for which it is occupied, maintained, let, or leased; and where such use is not in full compliance with the applicable development standards of this title and/or is not otherwise permitted in the applicable zoning district.
B. No temporary use shall be permitted within the city except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A temporary use permit is required for temporary uses except those specifically exempted pursuant to ACC 18.46A.050.

D. A property owner or an authorized representative of the property owner or a person, business or organization desiring to use a property for a use consistent with this chapter may apply for a temporary use permit. An applicant for a temporary use permit shall provide written evidence of property owner authorization to use the property for the intended temporary use.
E. The planning director or designee may approve permits for temporary uses and structures, with conditions to mitigate negative impacts.

18.49.030 Applicability – Mixed-use development.
Flexible development alternatives for mixed-use development is a two-tiered process including minimum requirements (all of which must be met) and flexible criteria, which must score a minimum of 100 points in at least three categories, with not more than 40 points in any one category counting toward the 100-point minimum.
A. Minimum Requirements for Mixed-Use Development. In order to qualify for consideration under the mixed-use development provisions of this chapter, a development proposal must meet all of the following requirements:
    1. Site Requirements. 
        a. Location. The site of the proposed project must be located entirely within one or more of the following zoning districts: R-10, R-16, R-20, C, C1, C2, C3, CN, RO, RO-H, M1.
        b. Lot Configuration. The tract(s) of land for which the project is proposed shall be a common site with sufficient width and depth to accommodate the proposed use.
        c. Ownership/Control. All land included for the purpose of the development shall be owned by or be under the complete control of the applicant for such proposal, whether the applicant be an individual, partnership, corporation, group, or agency.
        d. Proximity to a Multimodal Transportation Corridor. The site of the proposed development shall be located a maximum of one quarter mile from a multimodal transportation corridor within the city of Auburn. The proposed development shall provide vehicular, transit, bicycle or pedestrian access to the corridor.
        e. Proximity to Public Street System. The site of the proposed development shall abut one or more public streets having a current functional street classification of principal arterial, minor arterial, residential collector, or nonresidential collector as designated by the Auburn comprehensive transportation plan.
    2. Project Requirements. 
        a. Development Type. The development proposal must constitute a mixed-use development. For purposes of this chapter, a mixed-use development is a single unified development that incorporates the planned integration of two or more different land uses consisting of some combination of office, light industrial (if allowed in underlying zone), hotel, retail, public entertainment and public uses, and/or housing. Mixed-use projects may be vertically oriented in one or more buildings, or geographically distributed on a development site.
        b. Consistency with Intent of Flexible Development Alternative Regulations. Applicant must demonstrate that the proposed development is consistent with the intent of the flexible development alternatives regulations as provided in ACC 18.49.010.
        c. Consistency with Auburn City Code. The proposed development shall be consistent with all other requirements of the Auburn City Code.
        d. Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. Applicant must demonstrate that the proposed development is consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the city of Auburn comprehensive plan.
        e. Arrangement of Uses. No residential use may occupy more than 25 percent of the first floor of a building with two or more uses.
B. Eligibility – Flexible Development Alternatives Scoring Matrix for Mixed-Use Development. Subsection C of this section shall be used to determine eligibility of a proposal for review under the city’s flexible development alternatives approval process. To meet the requirements, a project must: (1) score at least 100 points total by providing any combination of features or amenities found in subsection C of this section; and (2) score points in any three or more of Categories 1 through 9 listed in the table. For each development proposal requesting evaluation through the flexible development alternatives process, the planning director shall determine: (1) whether the proposal meets the criteria for each feature in the flexible development matrix in subsection C of this section; and (2) the number of points awarded for each qualifying feature consistent with the matrix.
Development proposals will only be awarded points for improvements or project features that exceed the requirements of the other chapters of this title, the other titles of the city code, and the city design and construction standards.

(Ord. 6245 § 19, 2009.)

18.49.050 Flexible development standards for residential development.
Residential development that meets the minimum eligibility requirements of ACC 18.49.020 is able to utilize the flexible development standards outlined in this section.
A. General Development Standards. The following general flexible development standards would be applicable to residential development that meets the eligibility criteria for residential development as outlined in ACC 18.49.020(A).
    1. Alternative Lot Dimension Requirements. Lot area, lot frontage and width, and setback requirements otherwise required under this title shall not apply to individual lots within a flexible development authorized under this chapter; provided, that the director has approved the proposed alternative lot dimensions for the development subject to the following limitations:
        a. Lots having primary frontage on a street other than a street created by the development shall not have reduced frontage or front setbacks unless the director determines that doing so improves consistency of building spacing and bulk with the character of the existing facility; and
        b. At least 50 percent of the required front, side and rear setback areas for the district shall be maintained in the development. In no case shall any side yard setback be less than five feet.
        c. In no case shall required lot widths be reduced below 50 percent of the underlying zone requirement, or below 30 feet as the absolute minimum required lot width within residential zones.
    2. Alternative Parking Lot Landscaping Requirements. Parking lot landscaping type, location, frontage, and area requirements under ACC 18.50.060 shall not apply to off-street parking areas in a flexible development authorized under this chapter; provided, that the director has approved an alternative landscape design for the development subject to the following limitations:
        a. Total proposed parking lot landscape area is greater than or equal to parking lot landscape area required under ACC 18.50.060(H); and
        b. No sight-obscuring plants will be allowed whenever safe sight clearance is necessary for ingress and egress from a public street.
    3. Alternative Engineering Design Standards.

The intent of this chapter is to provide minimum landscaping and screening requirements in order to maintain and protect property values, to enhance the city’s appearance, to visually unify the city and its neighborhoods, to improve the character of certain areas of the city, to reduce erosion and storm water runoff, to interrupt expanses of impervious surfaces, to reduce CO2 emissions, improve air quality, and to maintain or replace existing vegetation and to prevent and abate public nuisances. (Ord. 6617 § 28, 2016; Ord. 6387 § 1, 2011; Ord. 4914 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.50.020 Applicability.
A. This chapter applies to all uses and activities developed in the city excluding single-family and duplex units on individual lots.
B. When additions, alterations, or repairs of any existing building or structure exceed 50 percent of the value of the building or structure, or a residential use is converted to a nonresidential use, then such building or structure shall be considered to be a new use and site landscaping provided in accordance with this chapter; provided, that if any existing foundation or fence layout precludes full compliance herewith, then the landscaping requirements may be modified by the planning director in approved landscape plans. (Ord. 6387 § 1, 2011; Ord. 4914 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4304 § 1(33), 1988; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.50.040 Landscape development standards.
A. General Location for Landscape Improvements. Landscaping shall be provided in the following locations for all types of development, unless the city determines that the required landscape is not necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter:
    1. Perimeter Areas. All areas that abut a street or residential property shall be landscaped in compliance with this chapter, except where occupied by a primary building, walk or driveway. Minimum landscape areas are listed in Tables 18.50.040(A) and (B).
    2. Unused Areas. All areas of a multifamily or nonresidential project site not intended for a specific use (including areas planned for future phases of a phased development) shall be landscaped with existing natural vegetation, native grasses or similar.
    3. Parking/Loading Areas. Parking lots, and where loading areas are visible from a public street, shall be landscaped in compliance with this chapter.
    4. Outdoor Storage Areas, Recreational Vehicle Parking, and Refuse Areas. All outdoor storage areas, recreational vehicle parking, and refuse areas, when visible from adjoining properties or public streets, shall be landscaped in compliance with this chapter.
    5. Stormwater Low Impact Development (LID) Facilities. Areas of vegetation planted in storm water LID facilities (not permanently inundated or ponded areas) and for which there is a city-approved maintenance plan as prescribed in the city’s Engineering Design Standards Manual shall count towards the minimum landscape coverage areas outlined in subsection B of this section.
B. Landscape Area Requirements by Zones. Minimum landscape area requirements are listed below by zones consistent with ACC 18.02.070.

Notes: 
1Minimum landscape coverage required is the minimum percentage of net lot area that must be maintained with a vegetated pervious surface. Vegetated bioretention cells or water quality treatment swales (not permanently inundated or ponded areas) may be included in the required landscape coverage percentage. Preference shall first be given to retention of areas of existing native coniferous vegetation. For sites that do not have existing native coniferous vegetation, landscape coverage can be achieved through planting of native species.
2Listed planter widths shall be located entirely on private property.
3The minimum landscape planter abutting a street may be reduced in size using the provision contained in ACC 18.50.080, Alternative landscaping plan. The reduced landscape planter shall have an average width of the requirement contained in Table 18.50.040(A).
4Landscaping shall only be required in conjunction with an administrative or conditional use permit. The type and amount of landscaping shall be determined at that time the administrative or conditional use permit is approved.
5Refer to ACC 18.31.200, Architectural and site design review standards and regulations, for additional requirements.
6Landscaping within the RO/RO-H zone is not required unless site development includes the demolition of existing structure(s) together with new construction. Under this scenario the minimum landscape requirements of the C-1 zone shall be met.
7Landscaping within the DUC zone shall be provided as defined in the Downtown Urban Center Design Standards; see reference to ACC 18.29.070.
C. Landscape Design and Planting Requirements. Landscape design and construction for new development or redevelopment shall be compatible with the surrounding urban and natural environment. Landscape plantings shall comply with the plant type, size, and spacing provisions listed below.
    1. Landscape Design. Landscaping shall be designed as an integral part of the overall site plan with the purpose of enhancing building design, public views and spaces, supporting storm water low impact development facilities, and providing buffers, transitions, and screening.
        a. All required planting areas shall be covered with a mixture of trees, shrubs, and groundcover plants. Sodded lawn (not seed) may be substituted for some but not all of shrubs or groundcover plants. If sodded lawn is used it cannot cover more than 20 percent of the site and those portions of the lawn area must be served by an automatic irrigation system.
        b. Planting design shall have focal points at project entries, plaza areas, and other areas of interest using distinct planting and/or landscape features.
        c. As appropriate, building and site design shall include the use of landscaping against buildings to visually break up expanses of wall, soften appearance, and create visual interest through the use of planting areas, wall planters, hanging gardens, and/or raised planters. Loose rock, gravel, decorative rock or stone shall not exceed 20 percent of the planting area.
    2. Plant Types. Landscape planting shall be compatible with the character and climate of the Pacific Northwest and complement the architectural design of structures on the site.
        a. Native Landscaping. Landscaping materials installed shall include species native to the Puget Sound lowland region of the Pacific Northwest or noninvasive species that have adapted to the climactic conditions of the region in the following minimum amounts:
            i. Fifty percent of trees.
            ii. Fifty percent of groundcover and shrubs.
        b. Trees. Trees planted within 10 feet of a public street, sidewalk, paved trail, or walkway shall be a deep-rooted species and shall be separated from hardscapes by a root barrier to prevent physical damage to public improvements.
    3. Planting Size and Spacing. In order to balance both an immediate effect of a landscape installation and to allow sustained growth of planting materials, minimum plant material sizes and plant spacing are as follows:
        a. Trees. Trees shall be a minimum of one and one-half inches in diameter breast height (dbh) at the time of planting. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of four to six feet in height at the time of planting and may include either broadleaf or conifer. Tree spacing within the perimeter planters along streets and abutting residential property shall be planted no further apart on center than the mature diameter of the proposed species.
        b. Shrubs. Shrubs shall be a minimum of 18 inches in height, or two-gallon size containers, at the time of planting.
        c. Groundcover. Groundcover means low evergreen or deciduous plantings and shall be planted from either four-inch pot with 12-inch spacing or one-gallon pot with 18-inch spacing. Alternative spacing of particular species may be approved by the city if documentation concerning the effectiveness of the groundcover is submitted with the landscape plan.
        d. Additional Spacing Provisions. 
            i. Tree size and spacing at installation shall be increased by the city where needed to ensure visual access for vehicles and pedestrians and provide clear vision at street, access tracts and driveway intersections (sight distance triangles).
            ii. Trees or shrubs with a full-grown height equal to or greater than 30 inches shall not be planted in any sight distance triangle. Sight distance triangles are determined in conformance with the city of Auburn engineering design standards, Chapter 10.
            iii. A minimum distance of 15 feet is required from the mature diameter of trees and the center of street light standards.
    4. Landscaping Requirements for Parking Areas.
        a. General Parking Lot Landscaping Standards.
            i. All parking lot landscape areas shall be protected with vertical or extruded concrete curbs, or equivalent barriers. Tire blocks shall not be used as a substitute for curbing and boundary around the landscaped area unless they are integral to a storm water LID facility design as approved by the city engineer or his/her designee.
            ii. All parking lot landscaping must be located between parking stalls, at the end of rows of parking, or between the end of rows of stalls and the property line.
            iii. The maximum distance between any parking stall and required parking area landscaping shall be no more than 50 feet.
            iv. Shrubs, groundcover or lawn shall be planted to cover each parking lot planting area using the planting size and spacing requirements specific in subsection (C)(3) of this section. All groundcover shall have a mature height of not more than 24 inches.
            v. Modifications to protect drainage features, easements, or utility facilities may be allowed. Modifications that reduce landscape area or plant material shall be made up elsewhere on site, if possible.
            vi. The requirements of this section shall not apply to parking garages or to display areas for automotive and equipment sales and rentals that are specifically designed, approved and constructed for the display purpose and that do not reduce required landscape areas.
        b. Specific Parking Lot Landscaping Standards.

        +-------------------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    5. Landscaping for Outdoor Storage Areas, Recreational Vehicle Parking and Refuse Areas.
        a. Outdoor storage areas and recreational vehicle parking areas must be screened from view from adjacent streets and from all residentially zoned land by a minimum six-foot-wide landscape buffer. This landscape buffer shall contain evergreen trees or tall shrubs, a minimum of six feet in height at the time of planting, which will provide a 100 percent sight-obscuring screen within three years from the time of planting is required; or a combination of evergreen trees or deciduous trees, planted 20 feet on center with no more than 30 percent being deciduous and backed by a 100 percent sight-obscuring fence. In addition to the trees, shrubs shall be planted at four-foot spacing, in all directions, and groundcover provided.
        b. Outdoor storage areas abutting the Interurban Trail (regardless of the zoning of the Interurban Trail) and other future trails connecting to the Interurban Trail shall have a minimum 10-foot-wide landscape buffer containing the planting materials specified in subsection (C)(5)(a) of this section.
        c. Trash containers, dumpsters, trash compactors, and recycling bins associated with multiplex, multi-unit residential, and nonresidential uses must be screened from public view on all sides with a solid fence, wall, or gate constructed of cedar, redwood, masonry, or other similar building material reflecting the overall design of the site, and be appropriately landscaped (e.g., climbing vines, arborvitae, etc.).
    6. Irrigation. No portion of any landscaped area shall be located further away than 50 feet from a source of water adequate to irrigate the landscaping. The source of water may be a manual (hose connection) or an automatic irrigation system. (Ord. 6617 § 29, 2016; Ord. 6387 § 1, 2011; Ord. 4914 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4304 § 1(34), (35), 1988; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.50.045 Preservation of significant trees.
A. Retention. In the required perimeter landscaping area, applicants shall retain all significant trees. A significant tree means a healthy evergreen tree, six inches or more in diameter measured four feet above grade, or a healthy deciduous tree four inches or more in diameter measured four feet above grade. Alders and cottonwoods are excluded from this definition. If the grade level adjoining a tree to be retained is to be altered to a degree that would endanger the viability of a tree or trees, then the applicant shall construct a dry rock wall or rock well around the tree. The diameter of this wall or well must be capable of protecting the tree.
Areas devoted to driveways, curb cuts, and sight distance requirements, utilities and storm drainage facilities may be exempted from this requirement. Significant trees may also be exempted from this requirement if it is determined by the planning director based on satisfactory evidence pursuant to report prepared by a consulting arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture. The report submitted to the city shall demonstrate the significant tree is:
    1. Damaged; or
    2. Diseased; or
    3. Has weak structural integrity that poses a safety hazard.
If additional significant trees are to be removed, the applicant shall seek approval of an “alternative landscape plan” from the planning director under ACC 18.50.080.
B. Encroachment into Dripline. No construction activities shall take place within the dripline of a tree to be retained without extra precautions as recommended by a certified arborist. The applicant may install impervious or compactable surface within the area defined by the dripline when a qualified arborist determines that such activities will not endanger the tree or trees. (See the definition of “dripline” in ACC 18.04.318.)
C. Tree Protection. All significant trees that are to be retained must be protected during construction by installation of a protective barricade or fence. This will require preliminary identification of the proposed area of disturbance for staff inspection and approval, then installation of a protective barricade or fence before major excavation with heavy equipment begins. (Ord. 6387 § 1, 2011.)

18.50.050 Regulations by zone.
Repealed by Ord. 6387. (Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6269 § 20, 2009; Ord. 6231 § 4, 2009; Ord. 6036 § 3, 2006; Ord. 5863 § 5, 2004; Ord. 5342 § 2, 2000; Ord. 4914 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4304 § 1(36) – (39), 1988; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.50.060 Landscaping plan requirements.
A. Persons Qualified to Prepare Landscape Plan. A landscape plan signed by a licensed landscape architect is not required. However, if the plan is determined by the city to be illegible or inadequate for review the landscape plan shall be prepared by a landscape architect licensed in the state of Washington, a nursery professional certified pursuant to the Washington certified nursery professional program, or a Washington State certified landscape technician.
B. Application. A landscape plan shall be required and shall be accurately drawn using an appropriate engineering scale and contain all information specified by the planning director in the application form and accompanying checklist provided by the city. (Ord. 6387 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6231 § 5, 2009; Ord. 4914 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.50.070 Administration and enforcement.
A. Performance Assurance. 
    1. The required landscaping must be installed prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy unless the planning director determines that a performance assurance device will adequately protect the interests of the city;
    2. The performance assurance device shall only be valid for a 120-day period and shall have a value of 100 percent of the estimated cost of the landscaping to be performed, inclusive of planting materials and installation. If the landscaping has not been installed after the 120 days then the assurance device may be used by the city to perform any necessary work to implement the landscape plan. This time period can be extended if the city determines that:
        a. Installation of the landscaping would not be successful due to weather; or
        b. Product is not available due to the time of year;
    3. The performance assurance device shall be accompanied by an agreement granting the city and its agents the right to enter the property and perform work. The agreement shall also hold the city harmless from all claims and expenses, including attorney’s fees;
    4. Upon completion of the required landscaping by the property owner the city shall release the performance assurance device.
B. Initial Maintenance Period and Maintenance Assurance Device. After installation of the required landscaping, the property owner shall complete an initial maintenance period lasting one year. The property owner shall comply with the provisions below:
    1. The property owner shall be responsible for replacing any unhealthy or dead plants for a period of one year after the initial planting.
    2. The planning director shall require a maintenance assurance device, unless converting a single-family residence to a nonresidential use within the RO district, for a period of one year from the completion of planting in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section. The value of the maintenance assurance device shall equal at least 100 percent of the total landscape materials plus installation.
    3. If the landscaping is not being properly maintained, the property owner shall be so notified by the city. If after 30 days from the city’s notification the landscaping is still not being maintained then the maintenance device may be used by the city to perform any type of maintenance necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
    4. The maintenance assurance device shall be accompanied by an agreement granting the city and its agents the right to enter the property and perform any necessary work. The agreement shall also hold the city harmless from all claims and expenses, including attorney’s fees.
    5. Upon completion of the one-year maintenance period, and if maintenance has not been performed by the city, the city shall release the maintenance assurance device.
C. Maintenance of Landscape Area (On-Going). Landscaping, including trees, shrubs, groundcover, or grass, planted as a requirement pursuant to this title or ACC Title 16 or 17 shall be maintained in a healthy, living condition. All landscaping which, due to accident, damage, disease, lack of maintenance, or other cause, fails to show a healthy appearance and growth shall be replaced. Replacement plants shall conform to all standards that govern the original planting installation, approved landscaping plan, or as approved by the planning director. If the landscaping is not replaced the property owner or designee shall be subject to the enforcement provisions contained in subsection D of this section.
    1. Tree and Shrub Pruning. A permit is not required to prune trees and shrubs on private property. Pruning which results in the removal of at least half of the live crown will be considered tree removal and subject to the provisions in subsection D of this section. Tree pruning should be performed by a landscape contractor, one that is certified by the International Society of Arboriculture as a certified tree trimmer or certified arborist or other qualified tree expert.
    2. Limitations on Allowable Pruning. Tree and shrub pruning shall be allowed only for the following purposes:
        a. Removal of dead wood and diseased, crowded, and weakly attached trunks and branches that create a hazard to private property and citizens;
        b. Providing adequate clearance and visibility for safe use of parking stalls, travel ways and walkways for the passage of persons and vehicles;
        c. Eliminating traffic sign visibility obstructions;

18.52.005 Intent.
This chapter establishes regulations which provide for safe, attractive, and convenient off-street parking and loading and to ensure that parking areas are compatible with surrounding land uses. The city discourages providing parking in excess of that required by this chapter. (Ord. 6388 § 1, 2011.)

18.52.010 Applicability.
Except as otherwise provided in adopted contract rezones, development agreements, design standards and guidelines, or similar more specific process, off-street parking and loading provisions of this chapter shall apply as follows:
A. New Development. For all buildings or structures erected and all uses of land (property) established, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by this chapter.
B. Change in Use. When the use of any building, structure, or land is changed, increasing the intensity such that the change creates an increase of five or less parking spaces required by the change, additional off-street parking spaces need not be provided in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
    1. Special Provisions for the RO, Residential Office District.
        a. Within the RO, residential office zoning district, if any existing, nonresidential use is changed to another use, the requirements of this chapter shall apply in full to the new use if and only if the change in parking requirements between the old and new uses is greater than two spaces; except that if the applicant submits an alternate parking plan sufficiently justifying that the existing parking meets the needs of the new use, the planning director may authorize the satisfaction of parking through the special exception process.
        b. Whenever there is a change from a residential use to a nonresidential use in an existing building within the RO, residential office zoning district, the requirements of this chapter shall apply in full to the new use; except if the structure is being used as both a residence and business, then if the applicant submits an alternate parking plan sufficiently justifying that the parking meets the needs of both uses, the planning director may authorize the satisfaction of parking through the special exception process.
C. Modification to Existing Structures or Uses of Land. Whenever an existing building or structure is modified or uses of land are modified such that the modification would require an increase of more than five off-street parking spaces, additional off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
D. Modification to Existing Parking Lots.
    1. Any parking lot hereafter physically altered shall comply with all of the provisions of this chapter, except that such lot which provides five percent of its area in landscaping and the landscaping is healthy and in good maintenance shall be deemed to comply with ACC 18.50.040(C)(4).
    2. For existing parking lots that are resurfaced in excess of 50 percent of their area, then at least five percent of the entire parking area shall be landscaped consistent with Chapter 18.50 ACC.
    3. If existing parking lots are restriped, then the new layout of the parking spaces shall be the same as the previous layout or, if changed, then the changed layout shall conform to the existing dimensional requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 6388 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6287 § 2, 2010; Ord. 6231 § 7, 2009; Ord. 4949 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.52.020 Number of off-street parking spaces required.
Each principal use of the land, building, or structure shall provide the number of off-street parking spaces required by this section. The following standards are not applicable in the DUC, downtown urban center zone; refer to Chapter 18.29 ACC for specific requirements for that zone.
A. Parking Requirements by Land Use.
    1. Minimum Number of Parking Spaces. Each land use shall provide the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required by Table 18.52.020, except where a greater number of spaces are required through a more specific approval process such as an administrative use permit or conditional use permit approval.
    2. Uses Not Listed. Where a use is not listed in Table 18.52.020, the planning director shall determine the number of required parking and/or loading spaces. The planning director shall use the requirements in Table 18.52.020 as a guide in determining the number of off-street parking spaces required based on the similarity of uses or may consider a parking generation study.
B. Maximum Number of Parking Spaces. Except for required parking spaces for persons with disabilities, spaces provided in park and ride lots operated by a public transit agency, spaces for carpools, spaces for electric vehicle charging and spaces within structured parking with two or more levels, the maximum number of parking spaces for nonresidential uses shall not exceed 125 percent of the minimum spaces required by Table 18.52.020.
C. Measurement of Floor Area. In any case where Table 18.52.020 establishes a parking requirement based on floor area in square feet (for example: two spaces per 1,000 square feet (sf) of floor area), the floor area shall be construed to mean gross floor area (defined in ACC 18.04.430).
D. Use with Accessory Components. A single use with accessory components shall provide parking for the primary use, and each component. For example, a hotel with a meeting room may be required to provide the parking spaces required by Table 18.52.020 for a hotel (i.e., the guest rooms), and for a meeting room.
E. Obstruction. Removal of required parking or loading spaces from practical use by obstruction, erection of buildings, or other actions as to reduce the parking or loading capacity or usefulness thereof below the minimum requirements established in this chapter is prohibited.

    2. Compact Parking. Compact spaces may be allowed within a parking lot up to a maximum of 30 percent of the total number of spaces. This maximum percentage can be increased to 50 percent when approval is obtained by the planning director following the procedures contained in ACC 18.52.135, Alternative parking layouts. Compact spaces can be clustered or dispersed throughout the parking lot. Every compact parking space created pursuant to this section shall be clearly identified as such by painting the word “COMPACT” in upper case block letters, using white paint, on the pavement within the space or through the use of signage.
    3. Vehicle Overhang. Vehicular overhang of up to two feet is permitted, provided no vehicle shall overhang into a sidewalk or walkway which would reduce the unencumbered width of a sidewalk or walkway to less than four feet. A vehicle is permitted to overhang into a landscaped area by two feet; provided, that the required landscape area of trees and shrubs are not reduced in quantity and not subject to potential damage.
E. Surfacing of Parking Areas. Areas used for parking on private property, including interior driveways and access to a public street, shall be paved with asphalt concrete, cement concrete pavement, or pervious pavement and shall have appropriate bumper guards where needed. Paving is not required for temporary parking facilities that have obtained a temporary use permit pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 18.46A ACC, Temporary Uses; however, dust mitigation is required. Where a driveway crosses an improved public right-of-way, it shall be constructed with cement concrete. All pavement sections shall be designed to support the post development traffic loads anticipated due to the intended use as approved by the city engineer.
    1. Alternative paving systems may be provided subject to the approval of the city. The alternative must provide results equivalent to paving.
    2. For parking areas serving single-family dwellings and duplexes when located on individual lots, this section shall apply:
        a. Each off-street parking space shall be connected to an improved street or alley by a driveway a minimum of 11 feet in width.
        b. Not more than 50 percent of the front yard or 800 square feet, whichever is smaller, can be used as off-street parking surface. For the purposes of calculating the allowable area under this section, the front yard shall be the area between the right-of-way and the portion of the single-family dwelling’s front facade farthest from the right-of-way. The width of the front yard shall extend to each side property line.
        c. Driveways that exclusively serve nonrequired off-street parking spaces are also subject to the surfacing requirement.
        d. Off-street vehicle parking spaces, including those for trailers, recreational vehicles, and boats on trailers, that are provided in addition to those required pursuant to Table 18.52.020 shall be paved with one of the surfaces listed above (subsection E of this section), or gravel; provided, that weeds, mud or other fine material do not work their way to the surface of the gravel; and provided, that loose gravel is contained on the subject property.
        e. Boats not on trailers shall not be stored in the front yard.
F. Grades of Access Driveways. The grade of access driveways for off-street parking areas shall be subject to the driveway regulations contained in Chapter 10.04 of the engineering design standards.
G. Sidewalks or Pedestrian Walkways. Sidewalks or pedestrian walkways shall be visibly marked with differentiated pavement or other methods such as reflective/LED markers, double row of landscaping, or raised pavement.
H. Landscaping. See Chapter 18.50 ACC.
I. Lighting. See Chapter 18.55 ACC. (Ord. 6657 § 2, 2017; Ord. 6388 § 1, 2011; Ord. 6231 § 7, 2009; Ord. 4949 § 1, 1997; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.53.010 Intent.
A. This chapter establishes standards and criteria for the development of a master plan. The provisions of this chapter are voluntary and incentive-based.
B. The master plan is intended to establish conditions with which all concurrent and subsequent land use approvals implementing the master plan shall comply. The master plan process provides long-term guidance for a large area so that the continuity of the overall development is maintained. The process allows for development to occur in phases where coordination of public facilities is needed, when a master plan is needed to determine how best to develop the area, or when a master plan is needed to integrate various uses.
C. Use of a master plan is intended to recognize the valuable role played by public facilities such as educational and religious institutions as well as large-scale commercial development providing the community with needed services.
D. This chapter provides the vehicle for large-scale, multiphased developments by obtaining conceptual approval of several projects at one time and coordinating future provisions of infrastructure capacity. It allows the city to plan for the extension/expansion of public infrastructure in a timely and efficient manner.
E. The processes in this chapter provide opportunities for adjacent property owners, homeowner associations, and businesses to evaluate the cumulative impacts associated with the full build-out of large-scale public facilities and commercial developments. They allow for public input on the design and development standards of these projects to minimize impacts to adjacent properties and protect the character of the surrounding areas. They also ensure that large-scale public facilities and commercial developments are compatible with community character and values. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.020 Applicability.
A. Institutional uses such as community colleges, religious institutions, or public/private schools on properties five acres or greater may apply for a master plan.
B. Commercial or mixed-use projects on properties 10 acres or greater where the applicant plans a phased development over several years may apply for a master plan.
C. Property included within the master plan shall be under the same ownership or a signed agreement must establish control over multiple ownerships.
D. A master plan application may be combined with other applications such as a rezone or preliminary plat. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.030 Approval process and effects of approved master plan.
A. The initial approval of a master plan shall be a Type III decision as provided for in ACC 14.03.030.
B. The master plan can be approved for a maximum 10 years with a review by the city at year five. At year five, the city will review the following:
    1. Whether the phasing established under the original master plan still meets the needs of the applicant.
    2. Whether traffic substantially changed within the first five years of the master plan to an extent that would warrant additional review and mitigation.
C. No later than six months prior to the end of the fifth year in the master plan, the applicant shall conduct a neighborhood review meeting pursuant to ACC 18.02.130.
D. The master plan, including any approved extension, vests as to the uses and standards contained in the master plan for the period of approval except for development regulations related to public health and safety issues, including but not limited to building codes, fire codes, mechanical codes, plumbing codes, electrical codes, and property maintenance codes, which shall vest upon the city’s acceptance of a completed permit application for each specific permit.
The city reserves the authority to impose new or different officially adopted regulations if, and to the extent required by, a serious threat to the public health and safety, as determined by the city. The city also reserves the authority to impose new or different officially adopted regulations, if federal or state laws require new or different standards.
E. Subsequent project applications shall be consistent with the master plan.
F. The master plan will be treated as a single site for purposes of calculating impact fee credits per ACC 19.04.060. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.040 Public participation.
A. The applicant shall conduct at a minimum one neighborhood meeting as provided for in ACC 18.02.130 prior to the submittal of a master plan application.
B. Public notification shall be provided in accordance with ACC 14.07.040, except that notices shall be mailed to property owners within 500 feet of the project site. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.050 Decision criteria.
A. The proposed master plan shall be consistent with the Auburn comprehensive plan.
B. The proposed master plan shall comply with all applicable city codes. If the proposal incorporates elements from the incentive-based approach outlined in ACC 18.53.070, development standards may be different from that of the underlying zone.
C. There shall be sufficient capacity in the public transportation system to support the development of all phases of the master plan either through existing infrastructure, planned and programmed city improvements that are included in the CIP to the transportation network (e.g., concurrency), and additional improvements proposed in the master plan.
D. The master plan shall include provisions for the availability of public services such as transportation, water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, police, fire, and transit.
E. The master plan shall show how the proposal protects designated resources such as significant trees and critical areas, if applicable, in compliance with city code.
F. All potential off-site impacts such as noise, glare, and traffic shall be identified and mitigated to the extent practicable to bring the project within adopted city standards.
G. The proposed master plan shall be integrated with adjacent land uses through site design, landscaping, parking/traffic management, and multimodal transportation elements that limit potential conflicts between the proposed use(s) and adjacent uses. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.060 Components of the master plan.
The applicant shall submit a master plan application with the following components and meeting the requirements on the applicable checklist. The review body (e.g., hearing examiner) may modify the proposal, particularly those portions dealing with development standards and review procedures.
A. The current and possible future boundaries, including the boundaries of each phase, of the use for the duration of the master plan.
B. A narrative that addresses the following:
    1. The decision criteria outlined in ACC 18.53.050.
    2. Description of present uses, affiliated uses, proposed uses, and possible future uses for the project boundaries.
    3. Description of present uses and affiliated uses for the adjacent properties.
    4. If residential units are proposed then minimum and maximum floor areas, densities, and number of units shall be identified.
    5. If office and/or commercial is proposed then minimum and maximum floor area ratios shall be identified.
C. A conceptual site plan shall be submitted meeting the requirements of the applicable checklist.
D. A conceptual open space/recreation plan showing tree retention and removal, recreation areas (if residential units are proposed), and view corridors if applicable.
E. Proposed standards that will control development of the possible future uses that are in addition to or substitute for the requirements of the underlying zone. The proposed standards will need to include at a minimum:
    1. Height.
    2. Setbacks.
    3. Floor area ratio limits.
    4. Landscaping requirements.
    5. Parking requirements.
    6. Signage.
    7. View corridors.
    8. Facade treatments.
    9. Other architectural design controls.
F. Proposed development phases, probable sequence for proposed developments, estimated dates, and interim uses of the property awaiting development. The plan shall also address any proposed temporary uses or locations of uses during construction periods.
G. Information on the following items for each phase:
    1. Traffic impact analysis that addresses the requirements outlined in the city’s engineering design standards.
    2. Nonmotorized plan showing pedestrian and bicycle connections before, during, and after implementation of the master plan.
    3. Parking study that shows the projected peak parking demand, an analysis of this demand compared to proposed on-site and off-site parking supply, potential impacts to the on-street parking system if applicable, and proposed mitigation measures.
    4. Circulation plan for all modes of transportation including the following:
        a. The planned street system shall be compatible with the city’s comprehensive transportation plan and engineering design standards. Development that is proposed in areas of the city that have a planned street system, which is a part of the comprehensive plan or the city’s six-year plan, and any other street plan, shall make provisions for such streets and must not cause implementation of such street plans to become unattainable.
        b. Master plans that are proposed in areas of the city that have planned routes or facilities for bicycles, equestrian, or other nonmotorized transportation mode which are a part of the comprehensive plan or the city’s six-year plan, and any other street plan, shall make provisions for such routes and must not prevent implementation of such routes.
        c. When abutting vacant or underdeveloped land, new development shall provide the opportunity for future connection to its interior pathway system through the use of pathway stub-outs, building configuration, or parking lot layout. The proposed location of future nonmotorized and pedestrian connections shall be reviewed in conjunction with applicable development approval.
        d. Developments shall include an integrated nonmotorized circulation system that connects buildings, open spaces, and parking areas with the adjacent street sidewalk system.
        e. Pedestrian connections to existing or proposed trails/pedestrian routes on adjacent properties shall be provided unless there are physical constraints such as sensitive areas that preclude the construction of a pedestrian connection.
    5. The planned water, sanitary sewer, and storm drainage systems compatible with the city’s comprehensive utility plans and in conformance with the city’s engineering design standards. The conceptual utility plans shall contain sufficient information to demonstrate that the system layouts and methods of service are feasible. The city may also require additional design information (e.g., a preliminary drainage analysis) prior to approving the conceptual plans. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.070 Incentive-based approach.
Master plans are not a required process for large-scale developments. However, master plans provide the vehicle for large-scale, multiphased developments to obtain conceptual approval of several projects at one time coordinating future provisions of infrastructure, gather early public input, and provide the applicant with a certain level of certainty for a multiphased project. The following table outlines incentives for establishing a master plan and can be cumulative incentives:

(Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.080 Extensions and modifications.
A. An approved master plan may be extended beyond the 10 years for a maximum of five additional years provided:
    1. The applicant shall submit a complete extension request to the city for review not later than one year prior to the 10-year expiration date.
    2. The applicant shall demonstrate that the additional time frame is needed to complete the phasing of the original approved master plan.
    3. The applicant shall demonstrate that there will not be any additional impacts created by extending the time frame.
B. An approved master plan may be modified as follows:
    1. A minor amendment to an approved master plan may be applied for as a miscellaneous administrative decision processed as a Type I decision pursuant to ACC 14.03.010. A minor amendment is defined as not adding more than 20 percent to the gross square footage of the master plan. Minor adjustments shall be reviewed for consistency with this chapter and the regulations of this title, as well as the following criteria:
        a. The adjustment maintains the design intent or purpose of the original approval; and
        b. The adjustment maintains the quality of design or product established by the original approval; and
        c. The adjustment does not cause a significant environmental or land use impact on or beyond the site; and
        d. The adjustment is not precluded by the terms of this title or by state law from being decided administratively; and
        e. Circumstances render it impractical, unfeasible, or detrimental to the public interest to accomplish the subject condition or requirement of the master plan approval.
    2. Major amendments are those that, when determined by the planning director, substantially change the basic design, layout, open space or other requirements of the plat. When the planning director determines a change constitutes a major adjustment, a new application for a master plan is required and shall be processed as a new and separate application. (Ord. 6385 § 3, 2011.)

18.53.090 Revocations.

18.54.010 Intent.
Amendments over time to regulatory authority provided within this title may result in structures, land and uses which no longer conform with the provisions set forth for the district in which they are situated. Therefore it is the intent of this chapter to allow for the continuance and maintenance of legally established nonconforming uses subject to standards and provisions prescribed within this chapter. (Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.54.020 Continuance of nonconforming structures and uses.
Any nonconforming structure or use lawfully existing on the effective date of this title, or any subsequent amendments to this title, may be continued and maintained in conformance with provisions of this chapter, provided no enlargement of area, space or volume occupied by the nonconforming use occurs. Any nonconforming structure authorized by a valid building permit prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or any subsequent amendments to this title, may be completed and used in accordance with the plans, specifications and regulations under which such permit was issued. Expiration of authorized permits will result in a loss of vested right for construction and use of such structure. (Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.54.030 Use of nonconforming land.
If any parcel of land with a minimum lot size or lot dimension which is less than that prescribed for by the district in which such parcel is located, was subdivided into lots according to a plat of record on or before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or any subsequent amendments to this title, then the fact that the parcel of land does not meet the minimum lot size or lot dimension requirements as set forth in this title shall not prohibit the property from being utilized; provided, that all other regulations prescribed for that district by this title are complied with, except as provided for in Chapter 18.31 ACC. (Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

Changes of use, tenancy, ownership or management may occur to any existing legally established and continued nonconforming use under one or more of the following circumstances:
A. Any part of a structure occupied by an existing legally established and continued nonconforming use may be changed to a use which, in the opinion of the planning director, is of the same or of a more restrictive nature. When the use of a nonconforming structure is hereafter changed to a more restrictive use, the structure shall not thereafter be used for a less restrictive use.
B. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of any existing legally established and continued nonconforming use provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use except as authorized within this chapter. (Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.54.060 Maintenance, damage repairs and restorations, additions, enlargements, moving or relocation of nonconforming structures, and residential structures.

C. A nonconforming structure having been damaged or partially destroyed to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the assessed valuation of such structure as established by the most current county assessor’s tax roll, may be restored to its original condition, as authorized by the city’s building official, and its immediately preceding or existing use at the time of partial destruction may be continued or resumed. Restoration shall begin within one year and be completed within two years of the date of partial destruction. If restoration is not started within one year, then the reuse and occupancy of the structure shall conform to all the regulations of the district in which the use is located.
D. Structures or lands which are nonconforming as to use regulations shall not be enlarged or intensified in any manner unless the enlargement within such structures or lands conforms to all regulations of the district in which it is located. A nonconforming use, within a nonconforming structure, shall not expand into any portion of the nonconforming structure.
E. Structures which are nonconforming as to percentage of site coverage, setbacks, building height or density shall not be enlarged unless such enlargement conforms to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
F. Nonconforming residential structures are allowed to provide maintenance, alterations and additions which may exceed the requirements of this chapter; provided the total number of dwelling units does not increase and all other development standards of the district are complied with.
G. This chapter shall not prevent the following provided the total value of the improvements, over the lifetime of the nonconforming use, does not exceed 50 percent of the assessed value of the nonconforming use as established by the most current county assessor’s tax roll; and, the nonconforming use or structure is not expanded except as allowed by subsection H of this section; provided further, that any replacement of a nonconforming structure, or parts thereof, must comply with the appropriate development standards unless a special exception is granted pursuant to ACC 18.70.020:

This section does not allow the expansion of a use or structure which would be inconsistent with a previously authorized administrative use permit, conditional use permit, special property use permit, contract rezone, or binding agreement between the city and the property owner.
This section also does not allow the expansion of any nonconforming hazardous material storage.
I. When a building or structure is moved to another location it must then be made to conform to the requirements of the district to which it is moved, unless specifically allowed elsewhere by this title.
J. Nonconforming single-family residential homes and their accessory structures may be replaced and the new structure shall either meet the development standards of the district in which the home is located or the new structure shall not be more nonconforming than the previous use. All other applicable building and fire code requirements must be complied with. (Ord. 6269 § 21, 2009; Ord. 5170 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4705 § 2, 1994; Ord. 4304 § 1(43), 1988; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.54.070 Abatement of nonconforming structures and uses.
Nonconforming structures and uses shall be abated if one or more of the following circumstances exist:
A. If a nonconforming use is discontinued and changed to a conforming use, any future use of the structure or land shall be in conformity to the regulations of the district in which structure or land is located;
B. Any structure or portion of a nonresidential structure, or parcel of land occupied by a nonconforming use which becomes vacant and remains unoccupied for a continuous period of 180 days shall not thereafter be occupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district in which it is located. Residential uses in commercial or industrial zones which are unoccupied for more than 180 days may be allowed to reoccupy if a special exception is issued pursuant to ACC 18.70.020;
C. If a nonconforming structure sustains damage or destruction which exceeds 50 percent of the current assessed valuation of the structure as established by the county assessor’s office. Reconstruction of such damaged structure or reuse of occupancy shall conform to all regulations of the district in which it is located and it shall be treated as a new building. This subsection shall not apply to single-family dwellings. (Ord. 5170 § 1, 1998; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

For all marijuana related businesses and marijuana cooperatives, marijuana shall be grown in a structure. Outdoor cultivation is prohibited in all instances. (Ord. 6642 § 30, 2017.)

18.59.050 Required odor control for marijuana related businesses.
Marijuana odor shall be contained within the marijuana related business so that odor from the marijuana cannot be detected by a person with a normal sense of smell from any abutting use or property. If marijuana odor can be smelled from any abutting use or property, the marijuana related business shall be required to implement measures, including, but not limited to, the installation of the ventilation equipment necessary to contain the odor. (Ord. 6642 § 30, 2017.)

18.59.060 First-in-time – Change in ownership, relocation and abandonment for marijuana retail stores – Nonconforming uses.
A. Areas Where No Retail Marijuana Uses Are Located. If two or more marijuana retail applicants seek licensing from the state and propose to locate within less than one mile of each other, the city shall consider the entity that is licensed first by the State Liquor and Cannabis Board to be the “first in-time” applicant who is entitled to site the retail use. First-in-time determinations will be based on the date and time of the state-issued license or conditional license, whichever is issued first. The director or designee shall make the first-in-time determination.
B. First-in-time determinations are location-specific and do not transfer or apply to a new property or site, unless the new site is within the same tax parcel.
C. Ownership. The status of a first-in-time determination is not affected by changes in ownership.
D. Relocation. Relocation of a retail store to a new property voids any firstin-time determination previously made as to the vacated property. The determination shall become void on the date the property is vacated. Applicants who may have been previously denied a license due to a first-in-time determination at the vacated property may submit a new application after the prior first-in-time determination becomes void.
E. Discontinuance. If an existing marijuana retail use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of six months with the intention of abandoning that use, then the property shall forfeit first-in-time status. For purposes of this section, discontinuance shall not mean a legal change in business name or ownership or Washington State Unified Business Identifier (UBI) number. Discontinuance of a licensed retail use for a period of six months or greater constitutes a prima facie intent to abandon the retail use. Intent to abandon may be rebutted by submitting documentation adequate to rebut the presumption. Documentation rebutting the presumption of intent to abandon includes but is not limited to:
    1. State licensing review or administrative appeal; or
    2. Review of building, land use, other required development permits or approvals; or
    3. Correspondence or other documentation from insurance provider demonstrating an intent to reestablish the use after either a partial or full loss or disruption of the use.
    4. The director shall determine whether a retail use has been discontinued, abandoned, or voided, whether in connection with an application for an administrative conditional use permit or as otherwise appropriate.
F. Accidental Destruction. First-in-time status or cessation is not affected when a structure containing a state-licensed retail outlet is damaged by fire or other causes beyond the control of the owner or licensee; provided all necessary local, regional, state or other permits and approvals are successfully obtained and redevelopment commences within 12 months from the documented date of the accidental destruction or the licensee provides documentation demonstrating why redevelopment cannot commence within 12 months; provided, that redevelopment is completed within 24 months of the documented date of accidental destruction.
G. Marijuana related businesses that had lawfully obtained all state and local approvals prior to the adoption of these rules shall be considered legal conforming uses even if the business is unable to meet the standards for geographic separations and square footage requirements outlined in this chapter. (Ord. 6642 § 30, 2017.)

18.59.070 Signage.
All marijuana related businesses shall comply with applicable sign regulations and standards as specified in Chapter 18.56 ACC (Signs) as may be amended. (Ord. 6642 § 30, 2017.)

18.59.080 Security required.
In addition to the security requirements in Chapter 315-55 WAC, during nonbusiness hours, all marijuana producers, processors, and retailers shall store all marijuana concentrates, usable marijuana, marijuana-infused products, and cash in a safe or in a substantially constructed and locked cabinet. The safe or cabinet shall be incorporated into the building structure or securely attached thereto. For usable marijuana products that must be kept refrigerated or frozen, these products may be stored in a locked refrigerator or freezer container in a manner approved by the director, provided the container is affixed to the building structure. (Ord. 6642 § 30, 2017.)

18.59.090 Specific standards for marijuana producers, processors, research and transportation businesses.
A. Marijuana production and processing facilities shall comply with the following provisions:
    1. Marijuana production, processing research and transportation facilities shall be ventilated so that the odor from the marijuana cannot be detected by a person with a normal sense of smell from any adjoining use or property;
    2. A screened and secured loading dock, approved by the director, shall be required. The objective of this requirement is to provide a secure, visual screen from the public right-of-way and adjoining properties, and prevent the escape of odors when delivering or transferring marijuana, marijuana concentrates, usable marijuana, and marijuana-infused products.
B. Any marijuana producer or marijuana processors operating within the city (1) shall strictly comply with all industrial, health and safety codes, including but not limited to WAC 314-55-104 and RCW 69.50.348, and (2) shall have at least 4,000 square feet of building utilized for its individual business, and the total square feet of all marijuana producers and processors in the city shall not exceed 90,000 square feet of building space; provided, that any such business that was licensed and existing prior to August 1, 2016, that did not have at least 4,000 square feet of building utilized for its individual business may continue operating, and shall be classified as a fully legal conforming use at its current location even though it did not have at least 4,000 square feet of building utilized for its individual business. (Ord. 6642 § 30, 2017.)

18.62.040 Surface mining standards.
A. Standard Hours and/or Days of Operation. No mechanical equipment shall be operated before the hour of 6:00 a.m. and no later than the hour of 7:00 p.m., six days per week. No mechanical equipment shall be operated on Sundays or legal holidays. These restrictions are not intended to preclude the service and maintenance of the machinery and equipment necessary for the mining operation.
The standard hours and/or days of operation may be reduced by the hearing examiner if determined to be in the best public interest, so long as the reduction does not conflict with or violate a city code, ordinance or adopted requirement or regulation.
The standard hours and/or days of operation may be modified for specific public works projects involving mixing of asphalt or concrete that is either:
    1. Required by a public agency to be performed outside the standard hours and/or days of operation; or
    2. Where performance of such work outside standard hours and/or days of operation will be in the best public interest because such performance of the work will facilitate expeditious and timely completion of the public works project.
A written request from the public agency whose project requires the work to be performed outside the standard hours and/or days of operation shall be made to the Auburn public works director. The request shall be in writing and be provided to the Auburn public works director not later than 10 days prior to the commencement of the project. The request shall include the name and location of the project, the proposed modifications to the standard hours and/or days of operation, and the estimated duration (subject to the weather) of the project, and a statement why the modification is in the best public interest and will facilitate the completion of the project.
If the request is determined by the public works director to be in the best public interest, that it will facilitate the completion of the pubic works project and will be consistent with any applicable city requirement the public works director shall, within five days of its receipt, approve the request.
B. Finished Slopes. The site plan shall illustrate which finished slopes are final and which ones are interim. Final finished slopes are those that will not be modified subsequent to the completion of mining. Interim slopes are those which will be modified subsequent to the completion of mining. Final finished slopes are not allowed to be altered unless for public safety and health reasons, once the mining has been completed and that portion of the mine rehabilitated. Interim finished slopes may be altered, pursuant to applicable city regulations, to accommodate the subsequent development of the site once the mining has been completed.
In the event that fills are necessary such fills shall be compactible to a minimum of 90 percent maximum density; said density shall be certified by a soil testing agency. No organic materials shall be permitted in fills.
C. Fences, Landscaping and Berms. Fences, landscaping and/or berms may be required to mitigate any impacts associated with the mining site.
D. Noise. Sound pressure levels, as measured on properties adjacent to property in the mining site, shall conform to the provisions of WAC 173-60-040, Maximum Permissible Environmental Noise Levels for Noise Originating in a Class C-EDNA (Industrial Area).
E. Blasting. Blasting shall be allowed pursuant to the permit requirements of the fire marshal’s office.
F. Rock Crushing. A rock crusher may be permitted if expressly allowed through the surface mining permit. The location of the crusher may be conditioned in order to mitigate any noise impacts.
G. Dust. Dust, dirt, fly ash, or other particulate matter shall not be emitted in quantities as to adversely affect adjacent property. Reasonable precautions shall be taken with storage, transportation, processing, roadways and other open areas so as to prevent the particulate matter from becoming airborne. It shall be sufficient cause to revoke a permit if the operator causes or permits untreated open areas located within a private lot or roadway to be maintained without taking reasonable precautions to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne.
H. Setbacks. No excavation shall occur within 50 feet of an adjoining property unless a lesser setback is necessary in order to attain proper reclamation. The setbacks shall be determined at the time of permit issuance. When the mining is complete and the site reclaimed, the 50-foot setback may be modified at that time to provide for the subsequent development. This shall be reviewed pursuant to applicable city regulations.
I. Department of Natural Resources Permit. Prior to a surface mining operations permit being applied for the owner/operator shall submit evidence from the State of Washington Department of Natural Resources that the state considers the proposal as a surface mine and will require a permit and reclamation plan.
J. Paved Apron. A paved apron or similar device, wash pits or similar provisions may be required in order to prevent rocks, dirt, and mud being tracked onto public streets, the width and depth to be determined at the time of permit issuance.
K. Street Cleaning. All adjacent public streets shall be kept clear of rocks, dirt and mud. Street sweeping and washing may be required as a condition of permit issuance.
L. Traffic Control. Warning signs and/or flaggers may be required as a condition of permit approval.
M. Inspections. The city shall have the right to make inspections of any property at any reasonable time as deemed necessary to determine compliance with the permit and/or obtain surface and well water samples. The city shall notify, as deemed necessary, any operator of a proposed inspection, however, lack of such notification shall not be cause for denying the right to inspect. The operator shall have the option of accompanying the inspector.
N. Adjacent Wells or Aquifers. The mining operation shall not result in the degradation of groundwater quality in shallow, intermediate or deep aquifer zones, located beneath and beyond the boundary of the active area of the mining site, which serve as the source of potable supply for the city or private citizens, or possess water of sufficient quality and quantity to be developed for future potable and/or municipal supply purposes.
In the event that actual or potential groundwater quality degradation caused by mining operations is indicated on the basis of inspections, on-site release of hazardous materials, violations of water-quality provisions of other ordinances, or off-site groundwater quality degradation documented in on-site or off-site wells, the city shall have the right to require the operator of the mine to immediately cease that portion of the mining operations (subject operations) which in the city’s opinion caused the degradation and submit to the city a groundwater remediation plan prepared by a licensed engineer. At a minimum the plan shall:
    1. Identify the means and/or methodologies that shall be employed to immediately halt and/or remediate the water quality degradation;
    2. Identify the conditions under which mining may continue to occur without further degrading groundwater quality and related conditions; and
    3. Provide a schedule of monitoring reports to the city every 30 days from the date of inception of the plan for a 12-month period. The city may also require the posting of a performance bond or similar financial security to ensure the implementation of said plan.
The subject operations shall be suspended pending city review of the plan and determination of adequacy, both of which shall occur within 15 days of submittal. If the city does not approve the plan, require modifications, or if the mining operator fails to submit a plan, the subject operations shall remain suspended until the mining operator makes the revisions directed by the city and/or until the mining operator submits an acceptable groundwater remediation and monitoring plan. If the revised groundwater remediation and monitoring plan submitted by the mining operator is approved by the city, the subject operations shall be permitted to resume upon the date the city approves the plan. Such approval shall not occur later than 15 days after the revised plan has been submitted.
If subsequent to the city’s approval of the mining operator’s groundwater remediation and monitoring plan the city determines that the mining operator has failed to comply with all of the provisions of the plan, or that a plan has failed to immediately halt and/or remediate the groundwater degradation caused by the mining operation, the city may direct the mining operator to suspend subject operations, pending demonstration of compliance with the plan and/or approval by the city of a revised plan. Revised plans submitted to the city shall be reviewed for decision within 15 days of submittal. Once approved the city shall immediately notify the mining operator that subject operations may resume if in compliance with the approved plan.
Additional setbacks or limitations on the depth of excavation may be required to protect adjacent wells or aquifers.
O. Performance Bond. If a performance bond is required to guarantee the performance of these standards or any conditions attached to the permit it shall be submitted prior to the adoption of the ordinance. The value of the bond shall be determined as part of approval of the surface mining operations permit. The bond shall be written to the city of Auburn only, and shall not be canceled without the express written approval of the city of Auburn.
P. Importing of Materials. The importing of materials, e.g., sand or topsoil, may be permitted if needed as part of the mining activity. These imported materials could be used for preparing the mining site for reclamation or blending with the on-site materials to provide for a better fill or construction product that is then exported. The import of materials that are only to be stockpiled, and are not related to the mining activity, will not be permitted. (Ord. 6185 § 4, 2008; Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.62.050 Asphalt and concrete batch plants.
Asphalt and concrete batch plants, and related processing facilities, may be permitted if approved as part of the surface mining operations permit. The plants must be an incidental use to the on-site mining activity. The plants shall only be located within the city’s comprehensive plan designated mineral resource areas. This provision does not apply to existing plants that are operating under pre-existing zoning authority. (Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.62.060 Subsequent use plan.
In order to ensure the creation of usable land, subsequent to the completion of mining activities, a plan shall be prepared that addresses the following:
A. In conjunction with the mining permit a subsequent use of the mining site shall also be approved. The owner/operator shall submit a plan, in sufficient detail, to determine that the subsequent use of the mining site will be in conformance with the comprehensive plan and this title. The owner/operator shall submit evidence that the amount of material to be removed is commensurate with the subsequent land use.
B. The development of the subsequent use may precede the completion of the mining. In such cases the operations plan and subsequent use plan shall be designed to reduce conflict between the subsequent use and the operations of the mine. If the subsequent use is developed in phases each phase must be able to stand on its own without reliance upon development of subsequent phases or future mining activity unless a phasing plan is approved by the planning director. The phasing plan must minimize the need for future development or mining necessary to complete the phase and provide for time frames to complete each phase including what is needed, e.g., extension of which utilities, streets, provision of parks, etc. The director may require financial security to ensure the completion of each phase. (Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.62.070 Findings of fact.
Applications for a surface mining operations permit shall only be approved if sufficient findings of fact are drawn to support the following:
A. The proposal as submitted meets or exceeds the submittal requirements in ACC 18.62.030.
B. The proposal as submitted meets or exceeds the standards of ACC 18.62.040.
C. The proposal has addressed all operational items listed in ACC 18.62.010 and any identified impacts have been appropriately mitigated.
D. The proposal is consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.62.080 Years of operation.
A. At the initial approval of an operations permit, a master permit will be given for the lifetime of the mineral resource at the mining site. These mines must be located within the city’s comprehensive plan designated mineral resource areas. Mines located outside the city’s comprehensive plan designated mineral resource areas may be granted a permit for up to 10 years and may be renewed but will be treated as a new application.
B. Operations under a master permit must be reviewed by the planning director at the end of each subsequent 10 years. The operator of the mine must submit to the planning director, at least six months prior to the end of each 10-year period, evidence that the mining operation is in compliance with the conditions of the master permit and the standards contained within this chapter. This evidence shall include the submittal of the existing topography in a computer disk form that is compatible with the city’s system. The operator shall also provide an estimate of the amount of material that has been removed, an estimate of when mining is to be complete, identification of any areas where mining has been completed and whether restoration has begun or is anticipated to begin.
C. The master permit shall remain in effect if it is found the operations are in compliance with the conditions of the master permit, the standards contained within this chapter, and there have been no significant adverse impacts that have occurred that were not previously identified and effectively mitigated.
D. If the planning director determines that operations are not in compliance with the conditions of the master permit or the standards contained within this chapter, or that significant adverse impacts have resulted from the operation and have not been mitigated, then the planning director shall so advise the mining operator in writing within 90 days from receipt of the materials provided by the mining operator under subsection B of this section. If the planning director determines that operations are not in compliance with the conditions of the master permit, the planning director shall advise the mining operator of any noncompliance and proposed corrections/revisions, including a time frame during which such corrections/revisions are to be made. If significant adverse impacts have occurred that were not previously identified and mitigated, the planning director shall advise the mining operator of any required corrections/revisions to the master permit to include such mitigation. If new operation standards have been adopted pursuant to this chapter the planning director shall advise the mining operator of any required revisions to the master permit to reflect the new standards, if determined applicable and practical by the planning director.
The mining operator shall have 90 days from receipt of the planning director’s notice under this subsection to make the required corrections/revisions or to appeal the planning director’s decision to the hearing examiner pursuant to Chapter 2.46 ACC. The hearing examiner may affirm, modify, or disaffirm the planning director’s determination. If the mining operator does not appeal the planning director’s determination, then the mining operator shall make the corrections/revisions proposed by the planning director and the master permit shall be modified to incorporate the revisions/corrections. If the mining operator does not make the corrections/revisions as required by the city, then the building official shall proceed with enforcement action under Chapter 1.25 ACC.
E. If permits for mines located outside the city’s comprehensive plan designated mineral resource area are not renewed, then the surface mining operations shall cease and the mine reclaimed pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 78.44 RCW. (Ord. 6442 § 23, 2012; Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.62.090 Existing mining operations.
For those surface mines that are operating under a valid city of Auburn permit that has not expired, and were limited to a five-year permit, the permit shall automatically be extended by an additional five years without the need for revisions to the existing permit or additional hearings and, if located within the city’s comprehensive plan designated mineral resource area, shall be deemed the initial approval of a master permit under ACC 18.62.080. At the end of the 10-year period any master permit may continue in effect pursuant to the provisions of ACC 18.62.080, and any other permits may be renewed pursuant to the provisions of ACC 18.62.080. (Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.62.100 Enforcement of permits.
Failure of the owner/operator to comply with any or all of the provisions of this chapter or any or all of the provisions of the individual surface mining operations permit may cause the building official to proceed with enforcement action under Chapter 1.25 ACC. (Ord. 5060 § 1, 1998.)

18.64.010 Intent.
A. It is the intent of this chapter to provide a process to allow for uses that are not permitted outright within a zone. Such uses typically require a special degree of control to make sure that they are consistent with the intent of the zone and compatible with other existing and permitted uses within the zone. Only those uses listed as requiring either an administrative or conditional use permit within a particular zone qualify for this process. The planning director or designee may determine that other similar uses which are not listed may also qualify for this process. This process shall not replace the variance procedure in Chapter 18.70 ACC or be used to permit uses that are prohibited within the zone.
B. Uses subject to administrative use approval are those which typically have some potential for impacts to neighboring properties, but which may be permitted within a zone following review by the city to establish conditions mitigating impacts of the use and to assure compatibility with other uses in the zone.
C. Uses subject to conditional use approval are those uses that typically have a greater intensity and/or potential for impacts to surrounding properties, and/or special characteristics that may not generally be appropriate as a use permitted outright within a zone, but may be permitted subject to review by the hearing examiner to establish conditions to protect public health, safety and welfare, and to assure compatibility with other uses in the zone. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.64.020 Process.
A. Administrative Use Permits. An application for an administrative use permit shall be reviewed in accordance with ACC Title 14 as a Type II decision, subject to the additional provisions of this section. The planning director or designee shall make the final decision unless the application is forwarded to the hearing examiner pursuant to subsection (A)(2) of this section, in which case the hearing examiner will make the final decision.
    1. Additional Public Notice Requirements. Administrative use permits for uses in the following zones shall be subject to the additional public notice requirements in subsections (A)(1)(a) and (b) of this section: R-C residential conservancy zone, C-N neighborhood shopping district, C-1 light commercial district, C-2 neighborhood business district, C-3 heavy commercial district, M-1 light manufacturing district, M-2 heavy manufacturing district, BP business park district:
        a. The mailing radius requirement of ACC 14.07.040(A) shall be increased to 500 feet; and
        b. In addition to the methods of providing notice required by ACC 14.07.040, public notice shall be posted on the city’s website.
    2. Following the public comment period provided for in ACC Title 14, the planning director or designee shall:
        a. Review the information in the record and render a decision pursuant to the procedural requirements of ACC Title 14; or
        b. Within 10 days following the close of the public comment period, forward the application to the hearing examiner for a public hearing and final decision in accordance with Chapter 2.46 ACC if the planning director or designee determines that one or more of the following exists:
            i. Public comments indicate a substantial degree of concern, controversy, or opposition to the proposal; or
            ii. A public hearing is necessary to address issues of vague, conflicting, or inadequate information; or
            iii. The application raises a sensitive or controversial public policy issue; or
            iv. A public hearing might clarify issues involved in the permit decision.
        c. When a public hearing before the hearing examiner is deemed necessary by the planning director or designee:
            i. The city shall provide written notice to the applicant within 10 days following the closing of the public comment period that the application is being forwarded to the hearing examiner for public hearing and decision pursuant to the procedural requirements of this chapter. The notice shall specify the reason the application is being forwarded to the hearing examiner;
            ii. Processing of the application shall not proceed until any supplemental permit review fees set forth in the city of Auburn fee schedule are received; and
            iii. The application shall be deemed withdrawn if the supplemental fees are not received within 30 days of the applicant notification by the city.
B. Conditional Use Permits. An application for a conditional use permit shall be reviewed in accordance with ACC Title 14 as a Type III decision. A request for a conditional use permit shall be heard by the hearing examiner in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2.46 ACC. The hearing examiner shall make the final decision.
C. When a proposal includes more than one element that requires administrative use and/or conditional use approval, the following review processes shall apply:
    1. For proposals with multiple administrative use elements, a single administrative use permit application will be required; provided, that findings of fact pursuant to ACC 18.64.040 are made for each element.
    2. For proposals with administrative and conditional use elements, a single conditional use permit application will be required; provided, that findings of fact pursuant to ACC 18.64.040 are made for each element. (Ord. 6442 § 24, 2012; Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 6185 § 5, 2008; Ord. 5811 § 6, 2003; Ord. 4875 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4304 § 1(45), 1988; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.64.030 Application.
In addition to the requirements for a complete application as set forth in ACC Title 14, an application for an administrative or conditional use permit shall include the following:
A. A completed permit application form signed by the property owner(s) and/or applicant;
B. A statement that the applicant attests by written oath to the accuracy and completeness of all information submitted for an application;
C. A site plan meeting the requirements of the applicable submittal checklist, which at a minimum includes the information in ACC 18.64.035;
D. Applicable filing fee(s), if any, as established in the current city of Auburn fee schedule and relevant deposit(s), if any, as permitted or required by other chapters or sections of the Auburn City Code;
E. Any additional information as required by the applicable submittal checklist or other chapters of this title for the proposed use. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 6185 § 6, 2008; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.64.035 Site plan.
A. The site plan required by ACC 18.64.030(C) shall include the following information:
    1. Vicinity map;
    2. Name, address, phone number of property owner;
    3. Name, address, phone number of engineer or agent;
    4. Boundaries and dimensions of property;
    5. Adjacent public streets;
    6. Easements, existing and proposed;
    7. Location and size of all existing and proposed utilities;
    8. Location of building(s), including setbacks;
    9. Location and layout of off-street parking;
    10. Location and height of fences;
    11. Location and size of signs;
    12. Landscape detail including but not limited to type and location of vegetation, initial and mature planting sizes and methods of irrigation;
    13. Building/structure heights;
    14. Exterior lighting detail including but not limited to type and location of pole-mounted and wall-mounted lights, fixture type and wattage, shielding and light orientation methods and on-site and off-site photometric impacts.
B. The submitted site plan shall be adopted and made part of any approved administrative or conditional use permit. For the duration of any administrative or conditional use permit, subsequent building permits and construction activity shall be in accord with the approved site plan.
C. Adjustments to the site plan may be approved as follows:
    1. Minor Adjustments. Minor adjustments to the site plan may be made and approved by the planning director or designee. Minor adjustments are those which may affect the precise dimensions or siting of buildings, but which do not affect the basic character or arrangement of buildings approved, nor the development coverage of the development or the open space requirements. Such dimensional adjustments shall not vary more than 10 percent from the original.
    2. Major Adjustments. Major adjustments are those, when determined by the planning director or designee, that substantially change the basic design, coverage, open space or other requirements of the permit. When the planning director or designee determines a change constitutes a major adjustment, no building or other permit shall be issued for the use without prior review and approval such adjustment.
        a. The submittal requirements, and review and approval process for a major adjustment to the site plan of an approved administrative or conditional use permit shall be substantially the same as that required for the original administrative or conditional use permit. An application for major adjustment meeting the information requirements of ACC 18.64.030 shall be submitted. At the discretion of the planning director or designee, the applicant may be able to resubmit or incorporate by reference some portions of the original administrative or conditional use permit submittal as part of the application for major adjustment; however, the application for major adjustment shall be subject to the same submittal, processing, and findings of fact requirements of this chapter for administrative or conditional use permits, as applicable. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009.)

18.64.040 Findings of fact.
Administrative and conditional use permits may only be approved if findings of fact are drawn to support the following:
A. The use will not have a substantively greater adverse effect on the health, safety or comfort of persons living or working in the area and will not be substantively more injurious, economically or otherwise, to property or improvements in the surrounding area than would any use generally permitted in the district. Among matters to be considered are traffic flow and control, access to and circulation within the property, off-street parking and loading, refuse and service area, utilities, screening and buffering, signs, yards and other open spaces, height, bulk, and location of structures, location of proposed open space uses, hours and manner of operation, and noise, lights, dust, odor, fumes and vibration;
B. The proposal is in accordance with the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan;
C. The proposal complies with all requirements of this title;
D. The proposal can be constructed and maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in design, character, and appearance with the existing or intended character of the general vicinity;
E. The proposal will be supported by adequate public facilities and services and will not adversely affect the public infrastructure;
F. The proposal will not cause or create a public nuisance;
G. The proposal’s impacts can be appropriately mitigated through the application of conditions of approval, as applicable. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.64.050 Conditions and period of approval.
A. In order to mitigate any significant adverse impact or support a finding of fact or prevent and abate public nuisances associated with the proposal, conditions may be imposed which could increase requirements in the standards, criteria, or regulations of this title or other city legislation or adopted policies.
B. Administrative or conditional use permit approvals shall be valid for the specific use authorized on a property, subject to the revocation provisions of ACC 18.64.070. A change in use shall cause the administrative or conditional use permit to automatically expire.
C. Administrative or conditional use permit approvals, or the portions thereof, that authorize hours of operation shall be valid for the specific use and hours of operation authorized on a property, subject to the revocation provisions of ACC 18.64.070. A change in use or hours of operation outside that authorized by the administrative or conditional use permit shall cause the permit to automatically expire. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4773 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.64.055 Appeals.
A. Administrative Use Permits. Any affected party may appeal the planning director’s final decision to the hearing examiner as provided for in Chapters 14.13 and 18.70 ACC. If the planning director forwards an application to the hearing examiner for a public hearing and decision pursuant to ACC 18.64.020(A)(2)(b), a request for reconsideration and/or appeal of the hearing examiner’s final decision may be submitted as provided for in Chapter 2.46 ACC. The planning director’s decision to forward an application to the hearing examiner for public hearing and decision may not be appealed.
B. Conditional Use Permits. Any affected party may submit a request for reconsideration and/or appeal the hearing examiner’s final decision as provided for in Chapter 2.46 ACC. (Ord. 6442 § 25, 2012; Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009.)

18.64.060 Time limitations.
A. Unless specified elsewhere, an administrative or conditional use permit shall be implemented within two years of the approval. If a building permit or occupancy permit is required for the administrative or conditional use and has not been issued within the two-year period, then the administrative or conditional use permit shall be null and void.
B. The planning director or designee may grant one extension of the time period for implementation of the administrative or conditional use permit of up to 12 months following the submittal of a written request by the holder of the permit a minimum of 30 calendar days prior to the expiration date of the permit. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.64.070 Revocation of permit.
The planning director or designee may revoke or suspend any permit granted under the chapter if any of the following conditions is found to exist:
A. Fraud in obtaining the permit;
B. Concealment or misrepresentation of any material fact on the application or on any subsequent applications or reports;
C. The operation is found to be in violation of the approved plans, conditions of approvals, or the terms of the permit and the owner has failed to correct the violation after proper notice thereof. (Ord. 6269 § 22, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.68.010 Intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a process to amend either the text or map of this title. (Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

18.68.020 Initiation of amendments.
A. Zoning Map. 
    1. One or more property owners of the parcel may submit an application requesting a reclassification of the parcel;
    2. The city council may request the planning commission or hearing examiner to conduct a public hearing on the reclassification of a parcel or parcels of property;
    3. The planning commission may upon its own motion call for a public hearing on the reclassification of a parcel or parcels of property.
B. Text. 
    1. The city council may request the planning commission to conduct a public hearing to amend any portion or all of this title; provided, that text amendments that are purely administrative or procedural do not require a public hearing, nor do they require preliminary review or recommendations of the planning commission;

18.70.010 Variances.
A. Subject to conditions, safeguards and procedures provided by this title, the hearing examiner may be empowered to hear and decide applications for variances from the terms of this title; provided the hearing examiner may approve a variance only if the request conforms to all of the following criteria. The examiner must enter findings of fact and conclusions of law which support the following criteria and any conditions:
    1. That there are unique physical conditions including narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the particular lot; and that, as a result of such unique physical conditions, practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships arise in complying with provisions of this title.
    2. That, because of such physical conditions, the development of the lot in strict conformity with the provisions of this title will not allow a reasonable and harmonious use of such lot.
    3. That the variance, if granted, will not alter the character of the neighborhood, or be detrimental to surrounding properties in which the lot is located. For nonconforming single-family homes, this finding is determined to be met if the features of the proposed variance are consistent with other comparable features within 500 feet of the proposal.
    4. That the special circumstances and conditions associated with the variance are not a result of the actions of the applicant or previous owners.
    5. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district.
    6. The approval of the variance will be consistent with the purpose of this title and the zoning district in which the property is located.
    7. The variance will not allow an increase in the number of dwelling units permitted by the zoning district.
    8. The authorization of such variance will not adversely affect the comprehensive plan.
    9. The variance shall not allow a land use which is not permitted under the zoning district in which the property is located.
    10. The variance shall not change any regulations or conditions established by surface mining permits, administrative use permits, conditional use permits or contract rezones authorized by the city council.
B. In authorization of a variance, the hearing examiner may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use as he may deem necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this title and in the public interest.
C. A variance so authorized shall become void after the expiration of one year, or longer period if specified at the time of issuance, if no building permit, occupancy permit or business registration has been issued in accordance with the plans for which such variance was authorized. The hearing examiner may extend the period of variance authorization for one additional year without public hearing upon a finding that there has been no basic change in pertinent conditions surrounding the property at the time of the original application. (Ord. 6269 § 23, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4705 § 2, 1994; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

            ii. That the special circumstances and conditions associated with the variance are not a result of the actions of the applicant.
            iii. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same zoning district.
            iv. The approval of the variance will be consistent with the purpose of this title and the zoning district in which the property is located.
    2. Variance to Building Height.

        b. Additional Public Notice Requirements. If a residential zoning district is within 300 feet of the subject site, then a public comment period shall occur following the procedures contained in ACC Title 14. The planning director or designee shall render a decision within 10 days following the close of the public comment period.

        a. Each portion of the property shall abut a minimum of 100 feet upon the alley.
        b. The two portions of the property shall be directly opposite for a distance representing at least 50 percent of the width of the portion of the property not to be occupied by the proposed building.

This section also does not allow the expansion of any nonconforming hazardous material storage.
    4. Pursuant to ACC 18.54.060(G), a special exception may be issued for the replacement of a nonconforming structure or part thereof which does not comply with the appropriate development standards.
    5. Pursuant to ACC 18.54.070(B), a special exception may be issued for residential uses, in commercial or industrial zones, to reoccupy if unoccupied for longer than 180 days.
B. In considering applications for special exceptions, the hearing examiner shall consider the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures, and no such special exception shall be authorized by the hearing examiner unless the hearing examiner finds that the authorizing of such special exception will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the zone or vicinity in which the property is located, and that the authorization of such special exception will be consistent with the spirit and purpose of this title. In authorizing a special exception, the hearing examiner may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location, installation, construction, maintenance and operation and extent of open spaces in addition to those expressly set forth in this title as may be deemed necessary for the protection of other properties in the zone or vicinity and the public interest. (Ord. 6269 § 24, 2009; Ord. 4840 § 1, 1996; Ord. 4229 § 2, 1987.)

    8. There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, lost environmental functions, rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to streambeds, shorelines, banks, roads, utilities, or other public facilities; and
    9. All requirements of other permitting agencies will still be met.
C. Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site, building or structure may be granted using criteria more permissive than the above requirements, provided:
    1. The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the site, building or structure; and
    2. The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the site, building or structure losing its historic designation.
D. Variances to the provisions of ACC 15.68.161 and 15.68.170 may be issued for a structure on a small or irregularly shaped lot contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the FPE, providing the other variance criteria are met.

18.76.010 Purpose.
The comprehensive plan provides the Lakeland Hills South special area plan is intended to be consistent with the conditions of approval of the Lakeland Hills South PDD (Pierce County Hearings Examiner Case No. Z15-90/UP9-70) as amended. The conditions of approval which remain applicable are attached to Ordinance No. 5092 as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.
Auburn has accepted the Lakeland Hills South PUD as an approved PUD. Therefore, this purpose section shall apply to minor and major amendments to the Lakeland Hills South PUD.
The purpose of a planned unit development (PUD) district is to offer enhanced flexibility to develop a site through innovative and alternative development standards. A PUD district also allows for a greater range of residential development scenarios, provides for internal transfers of density, and may result in more dwelling units than may be realized by using the existing development standards. In exchange for this enhanced flexibility, the city will require the PUD to result in a significantly higher quality development, generate more public benefit and be a more sensitive proposal than would have been the case with the use of standard zoning or subdivision procedures.
In order for a PUD to be approved it will be the applicant’s responsibility to demonstrate, to the city’s satisfaction, that the proposed PUD achieves or is consistent with the following desired public benefits and expectations in whole or in part:
A. Preservation of Natural Amenities. Preservation of desirable site characteristics such as open spaces and the protection of sensitive environmental features including steep slopes, rivers, creeks, wetlands, lakes and scenic views.
B. Pedestrian-Oriented Communities. Use of traffic management and design techniques to reduce traffic congestion and increase the potential use of alternative modes of travel such as mass transit, pedestrian and bicycle traffic.
C. Land Use Efficiencies. Provide efficient and effective use of land, open space and public facilities that result in lower development cost and make housing more affordable.
D. Implementation of the Comprehensive Plan. Provide development that is consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan. PUDs may also allow for a small amount of development from other comprehensive plan designations if determined to be appropriate for the PUD and its surroundings.
E. Enhanced Design Features. Provide building and structural designs that complement surrounding land uses and their environment. Design standards should reflect quality site planning, landscaping and building architecture.
F. Creation of Public Amenities. Enhance parks and open spaces consistent with the comprehensive park plan and nonmotorized plan.
G. Affordable Housing. Provide affordable housing options in accordance with Auburn’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

18.76.020 Process.
The approval process for major amendments to the Lakeland Hills South PUD is three steps. The first step is a recommendation by the hearing examiner and final approval of the PUD or major amendment by the city council using the process applicable to a rezone, Chapter 18.68 ACC. The second step is the approval of either a preliminary plat, a site plan, or a combination of both. Where a preliminary plat has been proposed, the third step is the approval of a final plat by the city council. Step two may be combined with step one.
A. Step One – PUD Major Amendment Approval. Approval of a major amendment to the Lakeland Hills South PUD shall be applied by the rezone process as specified in Chapter 18.68 ACC. Generally, a major amendment will be required because a specific proposal within a planning area necessitates an amendment. For the proposal triggering the need for the major amendment, the major amendment shall establish the land uses, density, number and types of dwelling units, number and distribution of lots/units, any modification of plat development standards, general street layout, street right-of-way widths, whether streets are public or private, the amount, type, and location of open space and park land, phasing plans if any, and the responsibilities of the owner/developer. If there is no specific proposal, the major amendment shall establish these parameters to the extent possible. Application for PUD major amendment approval shall be in accordance with ACC 18.76.090.
B. Step Two – Preliminary Plat/Site Plan Approval. For those major amendments to the Lakeland Hills South PUD that consist of only single-family or duplex platted lots, a preliminary plat may be filed pursuant to Chapter 17.06 ACC. For all other uses, a site plan must be approved by the director of planning pursuant to ACC 18.76.160. Preliminary plat and site plan approval must be concurrent if a PUD requires both approvals. Preliminary plat/site plan applications may be for all or a portion of a planning area. Applications for a site plan shall be in accordance with ACC 18.76.160.
C. Step Three – Final Plat Approval. Final plats shall be approved pursuant to Chapter 17.10 ACC. (Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

B. The number of acres of the net usable area of the planning area is multiplied by the residential densities allowed in the official Lakeland plan map to produce the maximum number of dwelling units. Any fractions may be rounded up to the nearest whole number as long as the densities as outlined in subsection C of this section are not exceeded.
C. Residential densities within each planning area allowed by the official Lakeland plan map are as follows:
+-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
| Lakeland Hills South Comprehensive Plan | Maximum Number of Dwelling Units |
|             Map Designation             |             Per Acre             |

Convenient, barrier free, pedestrian access to transit stops, when applicable, shall be provided.
D. Architectural Design Guidelines. The purpose of this section is to provide design guidelines that will be utilized to insure the creation of high quality development that is internally consistent and harmonious throughout the PUD. The following design guidelines are suggested as a means to create a high quality, pedestrian-oriented community.
    1. All residential buildings shall be designed and constructed to minimize visual intrusions into windows and private spaces of adjoining developments.
    2. Within single-family planning areas, all buildings shall be designed and constructed consistent with approvals granted pursuant to the Auburn City Code.
    3. Multifamily buildings within the moderate density planning areas shall incorporate design elements that are reflective of single-family housing. These design elements may include the use of pitched roof systems, limits on length of buildings and building massing, a limited number of entrances as viewed from any particular elevation, varied setbacks to avoid massing of buildings along setback lines of arterial and collector streets, and a combination of landscaping and fences within setbacks to create private space.
    4. Multifamily buildings within the high density planning areas shall also incorporate design elements such as roof treatments and building articulation intended to minimize building mass to insure compatibility with adjoining lower density development, parking shall be clustered in locations that minimize visibility from public streets, or screened with berms and landscaping, solid waste and outdoor storage facilities shall be limited to enclosures that are architecturally compatible with the primary building, and pool and recreation areas shall be located away from property lines of adjoining lower density residential development.
    5. Buildings located along the Lakeland Hills Parkway linear park or which front other public parks shall incorporate landscape features that compliment the design of the public park, in accordance with the approved master landscaping plan referenced in ACC 18.76.075.
    6. Prior to or concurrent with the submittal of a commercial or nonresidential site plan, a design plan that incorporates the following elements shall be submitted to the planning director for review and approval:
        a. A consistent design theme compatible with the balance of the PUD.
        b. Exterior facades shall be softened by modulation, landscaping adjacent to buildings, and varied roof lines.
        c. Buildings on the pads shall be designed to be compatible with the design of the commercial structure.
        d. Rooftop equipment visible from adjoining development shall be designed such that it appears as an architectural feature and similar to the building with regard to color and/or texture. The equipment shall be arranged or screened in a manner to minimize visibility from adjoining development or public rights-of-way.
        e. One or more buildings, such as buildings on pads, should be located adjacent to the street frontage with parking located to the “rear” of the building.
        f. Truck loading areas should be screened from adjacent properties and streets.
        g. Trash disposal areas should be enclosed.
E. Fences. Fences shall comply with the regulations of Chapter 18.31 ACC except on those lots that have two street frontages and abut Lakeland Hills Way, Evergreen Way, Lakeland Hills Loop, 62nd Street SE, Lakeland Hills Parkway or other future arterial streets. In such cases a six-foot-high fence may then encroach into the yard setback abutting the aforementioned streets subject to the following: if a six-foot-high fence is proposed, it must be for all or a majority of the street frontage the subject lots abut. Individual six-foot-high fences on independent lots will not be permitted in the required setback area. A five-foot width of landscaping is required between the fence and the back edge of the abutting sidewalk. The homeowners’ association shall perpetually maintain the fence and the landscaping and the developer shall provide evidence of such perpetual maintenance. The fence and landscaping shall be installed prior to the occupancy of the home on the associated lot. The planning director shall approve of the fence material, landscaping and evidence of the homeowner’s maintenance.
All fences shall be consistent with the sight distance requirements contained in Section 2.14, Intersection Design Elements of the Design and Construction Standards Manual, as may be amended. (Ord. 5777 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5364 § 1, 2000; Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

18.76.075 Landscaping and screening requirements.
A. Within 120 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, a master landscape plan shall be submitted to the city planning director for review and approval. The master landscape plan shall designate the scope of the plan, plat material references, types of landscaping including screens and buffers, and regulations by planning area.
B. The purpose and goal of the master landscape plan is to achieve a harmonious and consistent appearance within the PUD area, including that of a well-planned residential area and a theme that carries into the nonresidential areas. Consideration of transitional areas and boundaries between different uses will be important. The city of Auburn landscape code shall be used as a guideline in the development of the plan, although ACC 18.50.060(L) shall not apply.
C. Until the master landscape plan in subsection A of this section is approved by the city planning director, the city of Auburn landscape code (excluding ACC 18.50.060(L)) shall apply to new development applications submitted to the city. The city planning director may approve variances from the code for specific submittals. (Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

The master sign plan shall include the design elements intended for various monuments, including major entrance monuments planned for major intersections, which may be similar in size and scale to the major entrance monuments located at the intersection of Lakeland Hills Boulevard and A Street, and secondary entrance monuments similar in size and scale to that planned for Lakeland Hills Way and Evergreen Way. The sign on the monuments shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 18.56 ACC, however, the size of monument signs shall be governed by the master sign plan. In addition, the master sign plan shall include the typical uses and approximate location of temporary directional signs, model home signs, and A-boards.
B. Except as modified by this section, the requirements of Chapter 18.56 ACC shall be applicable throughout the PUD until such time as the city approves the master sign plan. Upon approval of a master sign plan, it shall control. Within each preliminary plat or site plan within the single-family, moderate density, and high density planning areas, the following signs shall also be permitted outright:
    1. On-site directional signs.
    2. Model home signs.
    3. Monument signs at all plat entrances.
C. The signs referenced in subsection B of this section shall be designed and constructed consistent with the examples shown on Exhibit D, attached to Ordinance No. 5092, and of the size and scale of similar signs constructed within the King County portion of Auburn. In addition, entrance monument signs shall be designed and constructed to be low in scale and set in a landscaped bed. Monument signs shall be located on property that is held in common by the homeowners’ association, and the homeowners’ association shall be responsible for maintenance of the sign and landscaping on a private easement.
D. Within the commercial and nonresidential planning areas, signs shall be subject to Chapter 18.56 ACC except as follows:
    1. Commercial areas within the PUD shall be limited to one pylon sign within each parcel. All other signs shall be monument style or wall mounted.

The commercial sign master plan shall include a coordinated sign theme that is compatible with surrounding development. (Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

18.76.080 Public infrastructure requirements.
 The applicant for the PUD must provide all necessary public facilities to include, as a minimum, the following:
A. Dedication of Public Utilities. Public utilities being provided by the city must be dedicated to the city unless allowed to be private by the city.
B. Water, Sewer and Drainage Facilities. All water, sanitary sewer and drainage facilities must be constructed and installed in accordance with applicable city codes and standards, including design criteria, construction specifications, operational criteria, and approved engineering submittals.
C. Underground Facilities. All public utilities must be placed underground except those that by their nature must be on or above ground, such as streets, fire hydrants, power vaults, telephone pedestals and open watercourses. The applicant is responsible for making the necessary arrangements with the appropriate entities for the installation of such services.
D. Streets. 
    1. All streets must be constructed to the city’s standards. Variations from minimum standards for pavement and right-of-way widths or other dimensional or construction standards may be permitted when special design features of the PUD or topographic considerations warrant the variation. The applicant must submit a written justification for any proposed variation along with evidence that the minimal functional requirements of the proposed street improvements are being met. The city engineer shall review the proposed variation and shall determine if the minimal functional requirements are being met and shall make a recommendation to the city council whether the variation should be approved. The city council shall act upon the request and may require conditions of approval to ensure the minimal functional requirements are being met.
    2. Private streets may be permitted within the PUD, provided they meet the following criteria:
        a. Use of the private street is limited to those accessing property within the planning area or immediately adjacent to the planning area and is not needed by non-PUD residents to travel from one public street to another. The design of the private street shall be such that it will discourage any through traffic that is not related to the planning area itself.
        b. The minimum pavement width for private streets shall be 28 feet; provided, that on-street parking is allowed only on one side of the street or 20 feet for alleys. The roadway section pavement depth for asphalt, crushed rock, and gravel base and the material specifications of these materials shall be the same as Auburn standards for public streets. Additional width may be required if determined to be needed to provide adequate circulation for the residents of the PUD. Factors to be considered include but are not limited to providing emergency equipment access, preventing conflicts between pedestrians and vehicle traffic, on-street parking, number of units, the need for sidewalks and bike paths. The pavement width and construction standards, to include but not limited to, illumination, signing, storm drainage, curbs, gutters, channelization, e.g., shall be determined by the city engineer at the time of preliminary plat or site plan approval. Private streets and/or access tracts and shared driveways that provide a second or additional access to lots/units shall be constructed to standards, as determined by the city engineer, considered to be appropriate for the situation. Factors to be considered include the number of units served, emergency access and traffic circulation.
        c. All sites served by a private street greater than 600 feet in length shall have at least two access connections to a public street and provide for adequate emergency equipment access.
        d. A legally incorporated property owners’ association assumes the responsibility and cost to repair and maintain the proposed private streets. If the association fails to maintain the street, the by-laws of the association give the city the right to maintain the street and charge the cost of the maintenance, including any administrative costs, to the association members.
        e. The by-laws establishing the association must state that if future owners should request that private streets be changed to public streets, then the owners fully agree that, before acceptance of such streets by the city, the owners will bear full expense of reconstruction or any other action necessary to make the streets substantially consistent to the requirements of public streets, applicable at that time. (Ord. 6532 § 31, 2014; Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

B. Adjustments that are not minor as defined in subsection A of this section are considered major amendments and will be processed in the same manner as a new PUD application. If a major amendment affecting the official Lakeland plan map is approved, the map and Exhibit B, attached to Ordinance No. 5092, shall be amended to reflect the change. If a major amendment changing conditions of approval is adopted, Exhibit A, attached to Ordinance No. 5092, shall be amended to reflect the change.
C. Any change in the exterior boundaries of the PUD or an increase in the total permitted dwelling units above 3,408 shall require a rezone.
D. The following approvals require a comprehensive plan amendment:
    1. An increase in the total number of permitted dwelling units above 3,408.
    2. An increase in the permitted number of high density multifamily dwelling units (i.e., more than 850 units).
    3. An increase in the acreage permitted for light commercial development (i.e., more than 20 acres).
    4. A major amendment to the external boundaries of the medium density or high density planning areas.
    5. A reduction in required open space (i.e., below 153 acres). (Ord. 5397 § 1, 2000; Ord. 5092 § 1, 1998.)

18.76.180 Property owners’ association.

18.78.010 Purpose.
The purpose of the Terrace View zoning district is to establish zoning requirements for the property commonly known as “Terrace View” which is located on the south side of the King/Pierce County line and east of the East Valley Highway. The parcel is approximately 52.66 acres in size. The Terrace View zoning district will reflect, in part, zoning provisions allowed by Pierce County and project submittals to Pierce County. Because of this, the Terrace View zoning district will be a modified version of the city of Auburn C-3 heavy commercial zoning district. The Terrace View zoning district also reflects the city of Auburn comprehensive plan map which was amended in 1998 to illustrate the property as heavy commercial. (Ord. 5377 § 2, 2000.)

18.78.020 Permitted uses.
The permitted uses allowed in the Terrace View zoning district will be those as allowed within Chapter 18.23 ACC, C-3 heavy commercial district, as may be amended. The process to allow any use on the Terrace View property shall be as required by this title with the exception that apartments/multifamily units will be considered an outright permitted use and will not require an administrative use permit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all marijuana related businesses and marijuana cooperatives shall not be permitted in any residential or nonresidential portion of the Terrace View zoning district. (Ord. 6642 § 13, 2017; Ord. 6269 § 26, 2009; Ord. 5377 § 2, 2000.)

18.78.030 Development standards.
All development standards of this title will apply to the Terrace View property with the exception that no recreational vehicle parking spaces will be required if there are perpetual restrictive covenants recorded against the property that do not allow recreational vehicles to be parked in the multifamily complex. The restrictive covenants shall be approved by the city of Auburn and shall be recorded by the applicant prior to any building permits issued by Pierce County or the city of Auburn for any multifamily structure. An original recorded copy shall be provided to the city of Auburn. Any subsequent amendments to the approved covenants must be approved by the city of Auburn and recorded. Any recreational vehicles on the property that are in violation of this covenant shall be considered a violation of this title and will be subject to the provisions of Chapter 1.25 ACC, Civil Penalties for Violations. The owner/manager of the Terrace View property will be the party responsible for complying with Chapter 1.25 ACC. (Ord. 5377 § 2, 2000.)

18.78.040 Site plan.
A. The location of the commercial and multifamily areas shall generally be consistent with the site plan entitled “Terrace View – Apartments” and labeled as “Exhibit A.” The commercial area shall not exceed 10 acres.
B. Minor Site Plan Amendment. Minor amendments to the approved site plan may be made after review and approval by the planning director. Minor amendments are those which may affect the precise dimensions, design or arrangement of the buildings or other on-site improvements. A minor amendment will not change the basic character or design of the original approval or increase the impacts of the proposed development.
C. Major Site Plan Amendment. Major amendments are those that the planning director determines are significant changes to the design, character, intensity, density, use, etc., of the original site plan.
A major site plan amendment will require a public hearing to be conducted by the hearing examiner who shall make a recommendation to the city council regarding the major amendment. (Ord. 5377 § 2, 2000.)

19.02.010 Purpose.
The city council hereby finds and determines that continuing growth and development in the city of Auburn will create additional need and demand for school facilities, and that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of developing new facilities needed as a result. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the council adopts this chapter to address identified impacts of new residential development on schools and to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to meet demands for schools in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

V. “Standard of service” means the standard adopted by the district which identifies the program year, the class size by grade span and taking into account the requirement of students with special needs, the number of classrooms, the types of facilities the district believes will best serve its student population, and other factors as identified by the district. The district’s standard of service shall not be adjusted for any portion of the classrooms housed in relocatable facilities which are used as transitional facilities or any other specialized facilities housed in relocatable facilities.
W. “Student factor” means the number derived by the district to describe how many students of each grade span are expected to be generated by a dwelling unit. Student factors shall be based on district records of average actual student-generated rates for comparable developments constructed over a period of not more than five years prior to the date of the fee calculation; provided, that if such information is not available in the district, data from adjacent districts, or districts with similar demographics or county-wide averages may be used.

19.02.030 Determination of the amount of the impact fees.
The amount of the impact fees shall be determined for each school district as agreed to by the city and the applicable school district. The methodology to determine the fees will be based upon what other jurisdictions have used to determine their school impact fees and will address the terms and concepts defined in ACC 19.02.020, Definitions. The city shall only consider requiring impact fees for any school district upon receipt of a written request duly executed from the applicable school district. The city shall adopt by a separate ordinance an impact fee schedule for each applicable school district.
A. If the city annexes property and the affected school district has an impact fee schedule, approved by the applicable county, then if the affected school district has adopted a capital facilities plan which has been incorporated into the city’s comprehensive plan under the Growth Management Act that schedule shall continue in effect on an interim basis and the city shall consider adopting by reference the fee amounts that the county has imposed together with any formulas or methodologies used to arrive at the fee amounts.
B. If residential development occurs within a school district that is within the city of Auburn, and an impact fee schedule has been approved for that school district by another legislative authority, other than the city of Auburn, then if the affected school district has adopted a capital facilities plan which has been incorporated into the city’s comprehensive plan under the Growth Management Act that schedule shall continue in effect on an interim basis and the city shall consider adopting by reference the fee amounts that have been imposed by the other legislative authority together with any formulas or methodologies used to arrive at the fee amounts.
C. Any impact fee imposed shall be reasonably related to the impact caused by the development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements that are reasonably related to the new development. The impact fee formula shall take into account the future revenues the district will receive from the development, along with system costs related to serving the new development.
D. The impact fee shall be based on a capital facilities plan adopted by the district and incorporated by reference by the city as part of the capital facilities element of the city’s comprehensive plan, adopted pursuant to Chapter 36.70A RCW, for the purpose of establishing the fee program.
E. Separate fees shall be calculated for single-family and multifamily types of dwelling units, and separate student generation rates must be determined by the district for each type of dwelling unit. For the purpose of this chapter, mobile homes shall be treated as single-family dwellings, and duplexes and attached single-family dwellings shall be treated as multifamily dwellings.
F. The fee shall be calculated on a district-wide basis using the appropriate factors and data to be supplied by the district. The fee calculations shall also be made on a district-wide basis to assure maximum utilization of all available school facilities in the district which meet district standards.
G. Credit shall be given for school facilities or sites offered by the developer which the district accepts and approves as meeting district needs and standards, consistent within the capital facilities plan. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.040 Interlocal agreement between the city and district.
As a condition of the city’s authorization and adoption of a school impact fee ordinance, the city and the applicable district shall enter into an interlocal agreement governing the operation of the school impact fee program, and describing the relationship and liabilities of the parties thereunder. The agreement must provide that the district shall be liable and hold the city harmless for all damages which may occur as a result of any failure by the district to comply with the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 82.02 RCW or other applicable law. The agreement must provide that the district shall be liable, hold the city harmless and reimburse the city for defense and payment of all claims, including claims for damages, which may occur or arise as a result of any failure or alleged failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter, Chapter 82.02 RCW or other applicable law in the adoption, administration, or implementation of this chapter and any actions related to it. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.050 Submission of district capital facilities plan and data.
A. On an annual basis (by July 1st or on a date agreed to by district and the city and stipulated in the interlocal agreement), any district for which the city is collecting impact fees shall submit the following materials to the city council:
    1. The district’s capital facilities plan (as defined herein) as adopted by the school board;
    2. The district’s enrollment projections over the next six years, its current enrollment and the district’s enrollment projections and actual enrollment from the previous year;
    3. The district’s adopted standard of service;
    4. The district’s overall capacity over the next six years, which shall take into account the available capacity from school facilities planned by the district but not yet built and be a function of the district’s standard of service as measured by the number of students which can be housed in district facilities; and
    5. An inventory of the district’s existing facilities; and
    6. If the school impact fee adjustment request by the school district increases the school impact fee, the request shall be in writing to the city and submitted concurrently with the district’s capital facilities plan.
B. To the extent that the district’s standard of service identifies a deficiency in its existing facilities, the district’s capital facilities plan must identify the sources of funding other than impact fees for building or acquiring the necessary facilities to serve the existing student population in order to eliminate the deficiencies within a reasonable period of time.
C. Facilities to meet future demand shall be designed to meet the adopted standard of service. If sufficient funding is not projected to be available to fully fund a capital facilities plan which meets the adopted standard of service, the district’s capital facilities plan should document the reason for the funding gap, and identify all sources of funding that the district plans to use to meet the adopted standard of service.
D. The district shall also submit annually to the city a report showing the capital improvements for which the impact fees have been used.
E. In its development of the financing plan component of its capital facilities plan, the district shall plan on a six-year horizon and shall demonstrate its best efforts by taking the following steps:
    1. Establish a six-year financing plan, and propose the necessary bond issues, levies, and/or financing measures required by and consistent with that plan and as approved by the school board consistent with state law; and
    2. Where applicable, apply to the state for funding, and comply with the state requirements for eligibility to the best of the district’s ability. (Ord. 6420 § 1, 2012; Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.060 Annual council review.
On at least an annual basis, the city council shall review the information submitted by the district pursuant to ACC 19.02.050. The review shall be in conjunction with any update of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. The city council may also at this time determine if an adjustment to the amount of the impact fees is necessary; provided, that any school impact fee adjustment that would increase the school impact fee shall require the submittal of a written request for the adjustment by the applicable school district concurrent with the submittal of the annual capital facilities plan pursuant to ACC 19.02.050. In making its decision to adjust impact fees, the city council will take into consideration the quality and completeness of the information provided in the applicable school district capital facilities plan and may decide to enact a fee less than the amount supported by the capital facilities plan. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5950 § 1, 2005; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.070 Fee collection.
The school impact fee shall be imposed, based on the impact fee schedule, at the time of application to the city for a development activity permit. The school impact fee shall be imposed based on the impact fee schedule adopted for the applicable school district. The impact fee and the application fee shall be collected by the city and maintained in separate accounts. All school impact fees shall be paid to the district from the school impact fee account monthly. The city shall retain all application fees associated with the city’s administration of the impact fee program.
A. Impact fees shall be imposed upon development activity in the city concurrent with the issuance of a building permit. The fees are based upon the adopted fee schedule and collected by the city from any applicant where such development activity requires issuance of a residential building permit or a building permit for a manufactured or mobile home located on platted lots within manufactured/mobile home parks, and the fee has not been previously paid. Impact fees are only collected and disbursed within the boundaries of a school district that has executed an interlocal agreement with the city of Auburn.
B. Applicants for single-family and multifamily residential building permits and for manufactured/mobile home building permits shall pay the total amount of the impact fees assessed before the building permit is issued, using the impact fee schedules then in effect. The owner of the manufactured/mobile home park shall be responsible to pay the fee.
C. The city shall not issue the required building permit or manufactured/mobile home building permit unless and until the impact fees set forth in the impact fee schedule have been paid.
D. The city will impose an application fee, as provided for in the city’s adopted fee schedule, per dwelling unit which is subject to and not otherwise exempt from this chapter to cover the reasonable cost of administration of the impact fee program. The fee is not refundable and is collected from the applicant of the development activity permit at the time of permit issuance.
E. For complete single-family building permit applications for new development, redevelopment or a change in use, and prior to or at the time of issuance of any single-family residential building permit for a dwelling unit that is being constructed, the applicant may elect to record a covenant against title to the property on forms prepared and provided by the city that requires payment of school impact fees due and owing by providing for automatic payment through escrow of these school impact fees due and owing to be paid no later than at time of closing of the sale of the unit or at final inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (E)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full.
F. For complete multifamily building permit applications for new development, redevelopment or a change in use, and prior to or at the time of issuance of any multifamily residential building permit that is being constructed, the applicant may elect to record a covenant against title to the property on forms prepared and provided by the city that requires payment of school impact fees due and owing by providing for automatic payment through escrow of these school impact fees due and owing to be paid no later than at time of closing of the sale of the unit or at final inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (F)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full. (Ord. 6455 § 2, 2013; Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 6077 § 2, 2007; Ord. 5261 § 1 (Exh. A), 1999; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.080 Exemptions.
The following development activities are exempt from the requirements of this chapter:
A. Reconstruction, remodeling or construction of housing projects for the elderly, including nursing homes, retirement centers, assisted living facilities or other types of housing projects for persons age 55 and over, which have recorded covenants or recorded declaration of restrictions precluding school-aged children as residents of those projects. This exemption does not include individual single-family homes on platted lots unless the subject plat has such recorded covenants. Where such covenants have not already been recorded, but the exemption is sought, the city may require the recording of a covenant or recorded declaration of restriction precluding use of the property for other than the exempt purpose. If property using this exemption is subsequently used for a nonexempt purpose, then the school impact fees then in effect shall be paid.
B. Rebuilding of legally established dwelling unit(s) destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, explosion, act of nature or other accident or catastrophe; provided, that such rebuilding takes place within a period of one year after destruction and that no additional dwelling units are created.
C. Alteration, expansion, reconstruction, remodeling, or rebuilding of existing single-family or multifamily dwelling units; provided, that no additional dwelling units are created.
D. Condominium projects in which existing dwelling units are converted into condominium ownership and where no new dwelling units are created.
E. Any development activity that is exempt from the payment of an impact fee pursuant to RCW 82.02.100.
F. Any development activity for which school impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a condition of a plat, PUD or similar approval to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve school facilities, unless the condition of the plat or PUD approval provides otherwise. The condition of the plat, PUD or similar approval must also predate the effective date of fee imposition by the city or its predecessor in interest as provided herein and/or was actually imposed by the city or its predecessor in interest, specifically as a mitigation for impacts addressed in this chapter. Proof must also be submitted to the city that the required mitigation has been tendered for the development activity which would otherwise be subject to this chapter.
G. Any development activity for which school impacts have been mitigated pursuant to a voluntary agreement entered into with the district to pay fees, dedicate land or construct or improve school facilities, unless the terms of the voluntary agreement provide otherwise. The agreement and development activity application must also predate the effective date of fee imposition by the city or its predecessor in interest as provided herein. Proof must also be submitted to the city, prior to issuance of the development activity permit, that the required mitigation has been tendered for the development activity which would otherwise be subject to this chapter.
H. The replacement of a mobile home with another mobile home within an existing mobile home park. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5261 § 1 (Exh. B), 1999; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.090 Adjustments, exceptions and appeals.
A. Arrangements may be made for later payment of the impact fee with the approval of the district only if the district determines that it will be unable to use or will not need the payment until a later time; provided, that sufficient security, as defined by the district, is provided to assure payment. Security shall be made to and held by the district, which will be responsible for tracking and documenting the security interest.
B. The fee amount established in the schedule shall be reduced by the amount of any eligible payment previously made for the lot or development activity in question, either as a condition of approval or pursuant to a voluntary agreement.
C. Whenever a development is granted approval subject to a condition that the development actually provide a school site or facility acceptable to the district, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for the value of the facility, based on the actual cost of providing the facility, against the fee that would be required by this chapter. The value of the facility shall be estimated at the time of approval, but must be documented, and the documentation confirmed after the facility is completed to assure that an accurate credit amount is provided. If facility value based on actual costs is less than the calculated fee amount, the difference remaining shall be chargeable as a school impact fee.
D. The standard impact fees may be adjusted by the planning director, if one of the following circumstances exists:
    1. The developer demonstrates that an impact fee assessment was improperly calculated; or
    2. Unusual circumstances identified by the developer demonstrate that if the standard impact fee amount was applied to the development, it would be unfair or unjust, taking into account the purposes and intent of this chapter and Chapter 82.02 RCW.
E. In cases where a developer requests a fee calculation adjustment, exception or a credit pursuant to subsection (C) of this section, the planning director shall consult with the district and the district shall advise the planning director prior to the planning director making the final impact fee determination.
F. A developer may provide, and the planning director shall review, studies and data as a part of a request for a fee calculation adjustment, exception, or credit.
G. Any appeal of the final decision of the planning director with regard to fee amounts may be made by the developer, district, or other aggrieved party and shall follow the process for the appeal of the underlying development application, as set forth in the Auburn City Code. The planning director’s decision shall be given substantial weight and the appellant shall have the burden of proof that the final fee determination is unfair, taking into account the purposes and intent of Chapter 82.02 RCW and this chapter.
H. Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a permit or other approval of development activity. However, such payment under protest shall not excuse the applicant’s obligation to timely exhaust all administrative remedies and to comply with all applicable time limitation periods. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.100 Impact fee accounts and refunds.
A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the district solely for the district’s school impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which impact fees were imposed. Annually, the district, based in part on its report prepared pursuant to ACC 19.02.050, shall prepare a report on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned or received, and capital or system improvements for which impact fees were used. The district shall submit a copy of this report to the city. The city finance director shall maintain separate school impact fee and administration fee accounts pursuant to ACC 19.02.070, and shall prepare, for the city council, a report on the source and amount of all school impact fees collected and transferred to the district.
B. Impact fees for the district’s capital improvements shall be expended by the district only in conformance with the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan.
C. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the district for a permissible use within six years of receipt by the district, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for fees to be held longer than six years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified to the city by the district in a written report. In any decision approving such an extension, the city council shall identify the district’s extraordinary and compelling reasons for the fees to be held longer than six years in the written findings; provided, that any party that voluntarily elects to use the alternative fee payment method specified in ACC 19.02.070 shall sign as a condition of use of the alternative fee payment method a waiver of right on a form prepared and provided by the city to recovery of school impact fees not spent with the statutory six-year timeframe.
D. The current owner of property on which an impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered within six years or an extension granted under subsection (C) of this section of receipt of the funds by the district on school facilities intended to benefit the development activity for which the impact fees were paid. Impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The district shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service addressed to the current owner of the property as shown in the county tax records.
E. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the district in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the district in conformance with the capital facilities plan within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact fees.
F. Should the city seek to terminate any or all school impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded to the current owner of the property for which a school impact fee was paid. Upon the findings that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of the refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail addressed to the owner of the property as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the district, but must be expended by the district, consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.
G. A developer may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the impact fees, when:
    1. The developer does not proceed to finalize the development activity as required by statute or city provisions including the Uniform Building Code; and
    2. No impact on the district has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the district has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the district has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three years the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the district and provide receipts of impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The district shall determine whether to grant a credit and such determination may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in ACC 19.02.090.
H. Interest due upon the refund of impact fees required by this section shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the district on invested funds throughout the period during which the fees were retained. (Ord. 6341 § 2, 2011; Ord. 5078 § 1, 1998.)

19.02.110 Impact fee formula.
The impact fee calculation and schedule shall be based upon the formula set forth below. The formula is the city’s determination of the appropriate proportionate share of the costs of public school capital facilities needed to serve new growth and development to be funded by school impact fees based on the factors defined in ACC 19.02.020. Separate fees shall be calculated for single-family and multifamily dwelling units because of their different impact on school facilities. Separate student generation rates (student factor) must be determined by the district for each type of dwelling unit.

19.04.010 Findings and authority.
The council of the city of Auburn (the “council”) hereby finds and determines that new growth and development, including but not limited to new residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial development, in the city of Auburn will create additional demand and need for transportation facilities in the city of Auburn, and the council finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of transportation facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The city of Auburn has conducted extensive studies documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new developments on transportation facilities. These studies have contributed to the rates as established in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the council adopts this chapter to assess impact fees for transportation facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the council in establishing the transportation impact fee program.

19.04.040 Assessment of impact fees.
A. Effective July 1, 2001, the city shall collect impact fees, based on the fee schedule of the city of Auburn, from any applicant seeking a building permit from the city for any development activity within the city.
B. Effective May 19, 2003, where a change in use increases the trip generation by more than one whole PM peak hour trip, the director shall calculate a transportation impact fee based on the increases in the trip generation rate.
C. The director shall apply a heavy truck adjustment factor to the transportation impact fees for industrial land uses, addressing the percentage of vehicle trips for such uses made by trucks of three or more axles and the street capacity used by such trucks in comparison to other vehicles.
D. The amount of impact fees shall be based on the lowest rate in effect between the time an applicant submits a complete application for a building permit and the time of permit issuance, or pursuant to an independent fee calculation accepted by the director pursuant to ACC 19.04.050, and adjusted for any credits pursuant to ACC 19.04.060.
E. Payment of impact fees shall be made by the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued. The amount to be paid shall not be increased for any applicant that submitted a complete application for the building permit before the city established the impact fee rates.
F. Applicants that have been awarded credits prior to the submittal of the complete building permit application pursuant to ACC 19.04.060 shall submit, along with the complete building permit application, a copy of the letter or certificate prepared by the director pursuant to ACC 19.04.060 setting forth the dollar amount of the credit awarded. Impact fees, as determined after the application of appropriate credits, shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued.
G. The department shall not issue a building permit unless and until the impact fees have been paid or credit(s) awarded.
H. For complete single-family building permit applications for new development, redevelopment or a change in use, and prior to or at the time of issuance of any single-family residential building permit for a dwelling unit that is being constructed, the applicant may elect to record a covenant against title to the property on forms prepared and provided by the city that requires payment of transportation impact fees due and owing by providing for automatic payment through escrow of these transportation impact fees due and owing to be paid no later than at time of closing of the sale of the unit or at final inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (H)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full.
    3. The appeals process authorized in ACC 19.04.080 shall not apply to determinations made pursuant to this section.
I. For complete multifamily building permit applications for new development, redevelopment or a change in use, and prior to or at the time of issuance of any multifamily residential building permit that is being constructed, the applicant may elect to record a covenant against title to the property on forms prepared and provided by the city that requires payment of transportation impact fees due and owing by providing for automatic payment through escrow of these transportation impact fees due and owing to be paid no later than at time of closing of the sale of the unit or at final inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (I)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full.
    3. The appeals process authorized in ACC 19.04.080 shall not apply to determinations made pursuant to this section.
J. For nonresidential development composed of new development, redevelopment or a change in use and inclusive of commercial office and retail uses, light and heavy manufacturing uses, but excluding warehousing and distribution uses, and institutional development including but not limited to public and private schools and colleges and hospitals, and prior to the issuance of any permit application and following the execution of a payment agreement on forms prepared and provided by the city, the applicant may elect to pay transportation impact fees due and owing, less any credits awarded, no later than prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (J)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full.
    3. The appeals process authorized in ACC 19.04.080 shall not apply to determinations made pursuant to this section. (Ord. 6583 § 1, 2016; Ord. 6455 § 3, 2013; Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 6005 § 1, 2006; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.050 Independent fee calculations.
A. If in the judgment of the director, none of the fee categories set forth in the attached schedule accurately describes or captures the impacts of the new development, the applicant shall conduct an independent fee calculation and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations, once accepted by the city.
B. Feepayers may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the attached schedule. Such feepayers shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought.
C. The documentation submitted and supporting an independent fee calculation shall clearly show PM peak hour trip generation characteristics of the proposed development based on industry-accepted standards as articulated in the ITE trip generation manual. The modified fee shall be based on the average cost per trip established in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn, and shall consider the alternative trip generation data.
D. A nonreimbursable administrative fee shall be charged for each independent fee calculation. The fee shall be deposited with the city to pay for city review of the independent fee calculation upon submittal of the documented independent fee study.
E. After the city completes its review, the actual fees and expenses will be determined and the cash deposit shall be adjusted to provide for a refund by the city or additional payment by the feepayer.
F. While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in the attached schedule are valid, the director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer, but is not required to accept such documentation which the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness.
G. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the office of the hearing examiner subject to the procedures set forth in ACC 19.04.080. (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.060 Credits and adjustments.
A. A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for transportation impact fees be awarded to him/her for transportation project improvements provided by the feepayer in excess of the standard requirements for the feepayer’s development if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are identified as transportation system improvements that provide capacity to serve new growth in the capital facilities plan, or the director, at his/her discretion, makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the transportation goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan.
B. For each request for a credit or credits, the director shall determine the value of dedicated land by using available documentation or selecting an appraiser from a list of independent appraisers maintained by the department to determine the value of the land being dedicated. The value of the improvements will be determined through documentation submitted by the feepayer.
C. The feepayer shall pay the cost of the appraisal and shall deposit on account the estimated cost of the appraisal as determined by the city at the time the feepayer requests consideration for a credit.
D. After receiving the appraisal, the director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, where applicable, the legal description of the site donated, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate, and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit.
E. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.
F. No credit shall be given for transportation project improvements or right-of-way dedications for direct access improvements to and/or within the development in question.
G. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in ACC 19.04.080.
H. Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the fee rate in the fee schedule for the city of Auburn has been reasonably adjusted for other revenue sources which are earmarked for, or proratable to, funding transportation facilities.
I. In order to grandfather the capacity rights of existing land uses, the director will utilize the adopted rates to calculate any impact fee credits and to determine any surplus credits for off-site system improvements made by the property owner. Only in a situation when a property owner makes off-site system capacity improvements that qualify in accordance with subsection A of this section will any surplus credits (value computed during the permit year and not adjusted for inflation) remain with the property or any subdivision of that property to benefit future development where a traffic impact fee is determined to be due. (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.070 Exemptions.
A. The following shall be exempted from the payment of transportation impact fees:

19.04.080 Appeals.
A. Any feepayer may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a building permit. Appeals regarding the impact fees imposed on any development activity may only be made by the feepayer of the property where such development activity will occur. No appeal submitted under protest shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at issue have been paid. Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the director without first paying the fees, providing the applicant is willing to provide a satisfactory security of the appealed fee amount in accordance with the requirements of ACC 17.14.010(A) prior to issuance of the building permit. Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the public works director without first paying the fees, providing the applicant is willing to postpone issuance of the building permit until after the appeal process when the revised final fee is known.
B. Appeals of the public works director’s determinations made pursuant to this chapter shall be filed with the city’s public works department and shall be heard by the city’s hearing examiner pursuant to Chapter 2.46 ACC. Determinations on appeals shall be based on whether the decision being appealed was consistent with applicable state law and city codes. The hearing examiner’s determination shall be final unless appealed to the superior court of the county in which the property subject of the transportation impact fees is located within the city of Auburn in accordance with the procedures in RCW 34.05.510 through 34.05.598, and with the appeal being filed with the city clerk within 30 days after issuance of the decision of the hearing examiner. (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 6182 § 5, 2008; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.090 Establishment of an impact fee account for transportation.
A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and deposited in special interest-bearing accounts. The fees received shall be prudently invested in a manner consistent with the investment policies of the city.
B. There is hereby established a separate impact fee account for the fees collected pursuant to this chapter: the transportation impact account. Funds withdrawn from this account must be used in accordance with the provisions of ACC 19.04.110. Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected.
C. On an annual basis, the financial director shall provide a report to the council on the transportation impact account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the transportation improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.
D. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within six years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings extraordinary and compelling reason or reasons for the delay.
E. In order to comply with RCW 82.02.060(2), impact fees for development activity in the downtown plan area shall be paid for with public funds other than from impact fee accounts during the exemption period set forth in ACC 19.04.070 (A)(8). (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5604 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.100 Refunds.
A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within six years of when the fees were paid, or where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as established pursuant to ACC 19.04.090, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis; provided, that any party that voluntarily elects to use the alternative fee payment method specified in ACC 19.04.040 shall sign as a condition of use of the alternative fee payment method a waiver of right on a form prepared and provided by the city to recovery of transportation impact fees not spent within the statutory six-year timeframe.
B. The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant or claimant must be the owner of the property.
C. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the director within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.
D. Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on appropriate transportation system improvements.
E. Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city.
F. If and when the city seeks to terminate any or all components of the transportation impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail to the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for appropriate transportation system improvements. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within an account or accounts being terminated.
G. The city shall also refund to the developer of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur. (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.110 Use of funds.
A. Pursuant to this chapter, transportation impact fees:
    1. Shall be used for transportation improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development; and
    2. Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in transportation facilities serving existing developments; and
    3. Shall not be used for maintenance or operations.
B. As a general guideline, transportation impact fees may be used for any transportation improvements which could otherwise be funded by a bond issue of the city.
C. Transportation impact fees may be spent for transportation improvements, including but not limited to planning, land acquisition, right-of-way acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements including mitigation, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, applicable impact fees or mitigation costs, and any other expenses which can be capitalized.
D. Impact fees may be used to recoup transportation improvement costs previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs.
E. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of transportation improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.120 Review and update of impact fees.
A. The fee rate schedules set forth in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn shall be reviewed periodically by the council.
B. The fee schedules set forth in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn shall be reviewed by the council as it may deem necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the annual update of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 6050 § 1, 2006; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.04.130 Miscellaneous provisions.
A. Existing Authority Unimpaired. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the feepayer or the proponent of a development activity to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the underlying development approval process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent with the provisions of RCW 82.02.050(1)(c).
B. Captions. The chapter and section captions used in this chapter are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this chapter.
C. Severability. If any portion of this chapter is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such finding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section of this chapter.
D. Short Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “The City of Auburn Transportation Impact Fee Ordinance.” (Ord. 6341 § 3, 2011; Ord. 5763 § 1, 2003; Ord. 5506 § 1, 2001.)

19.06.010 Findings and authority.
The council of the city of Auburn (the “council”) hereby finds and determines that new growth and development, including but not limited to new residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial development, in the city of Auburn will create additional demand and need for fire protection facilities in the city of Auburn, and the council finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of fire protection facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The city of Auburn has conducted a study documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new developments on fire protection facilities. This study has contributed to the rates as established in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the council adopts this chapter to assess impact fees for fire protection facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the council in establishing the impact fee program. (Ord. 6341 § 4, 2011; Ord. 5977 § 1, 2005.)

Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065.

19.06.050 Independent fee calculations.
A. If, in the judgment of the director, none of the fee categories or fee amounts set forth in the fee schedule accurately describes or captures the impacts of the new development, the applicant shall conduct an independent fee calculation and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations, once accepted by the city.
B. Feepayers may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the fee schedule. Such feepayers shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.
C. A nonreimbursable administrative fee shall be charged for each independent fee calculation. The fee shall be deposited with the city to pay for city review of the independent fee calculation upon submittal of the documented independent fee study.
D. After the city completes its review, the actual fees and expenses will be determined and the cash deposit shall be adjusted to provide for a refund by the city or additional payment by the feepayer.
E. While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in the fee schedule are valid, the director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer, but is not required to accept such documentation which the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or where adjustment is deemed by the director to be appropriate based on principles of fairness under the circumstances of the case.
F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the office of the hearing examiner subject to the procedures set forth in ACC 19.06.080. (Ord. 6341 § 4, 2011; Ord. 5977 § 1, 2005.)

19.06.060 Credits and adjustments.
A. A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for fire protection impact fees be awarded to him/her for fire protection system improvement projects provided by the feepayer in excess of the standard requirements for the feepayer’s development if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are identified as fire protection system improvements that provide capacity to serve new growth in the capital facilities plan, or the director, at his/her discretion, makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the fire protection goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan.
B. For each request for a credit or credits, the director shall determine the value of dedicated land by using available documentation or selecting an appraiser from a list of independent appraisers maintained by the department to determine the value of the land being dedicated. The value of improvements will be determined through documentation submitted by the feepayer.
C. The feepayer shall pay the cost of the appraisal and shall deposit on account the estimated cost of the appraisal as determined by the city at the time the feepayer requests consideration for a credit.
D. After receiving the appraisal, the director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, where applicable, the legal description of the site donated, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit.
E. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.
F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in ACC 19.06.080.
G. Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the fee rate in the fee schedule has been reasonably adjusted for other revenue sources which are earmarked for, or proratable to, funding fire protection facilities. (Ord. 6341 § 4, 2011; Ord. 5977 § 1, 2005.)

19.06.070 Exemptions.

Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the director without first paying the fees, provided the applicant is willing to postpone issuance of the building permit until after the appeal process when the revised final fee is known.
B. Determinations of the director with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or value of a credit, or the director’s decision with respect to the independent fee calculation, or any other determination which the director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, can be appealed to the hearing examiner.

F. The hearing examiner may, so long as such action is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the determinations of the director with respect to the amount of the impact fees imposed or the credit awarded upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principles of fairness, and may make such order, requirements, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers which have been granted to the director by this chapter.
G. Any feepayer aggrieved by any decision of the office of the hearing examiner may appeal the hearing examiner’s final decision as provided in Chapter 2.46 ACC. (Ord. 6442 § 30, 2012; Ord. 6341 § 4, 2011; Ord. 5977 § 1, 2005.)

Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected.
C. On an annual basis, the financial director shall provide a report to the council on the fire protection impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the fire protection system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.

19.06.100 Refunds.
A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within six years of when the fees were paid or, where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as established pursuant to ACC 19.06.090, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis; provided, that any party that voluntarily elects to use the alternative fee payment method specified in ACC 19.06.040 shall sign as a condition of use of the alternative fee payment method a waiver of right on a form prepared and provided by the city to recovery of fire impact fees not spent within the statutory six-year timeframe.
B. The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant or claimant must be the owner of the property.

Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail to the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the appropriate fire protection facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within an account or accounts being terminated.
G. The city shall also refund to the developer of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur. (Ord. 6341 § 4, 2011; Ord. 5977 § 1, 2005.)

19.06.110 Use of funds.
A. Pursuant to this chapter, impact fees:
    1. Shall be used for fire protection system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development; and
    2. Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in fire protection facilities serving existing developments; and
    3. Shall not be used for maintenance or operations.
B. As a general guideline, fire protection impact fees may be used for any fire protection system improvements which could otherwise be funded by a bond issue of the city.

E. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of fire protection system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. (Ord. 6341 § 4, 2011; Ord. 5977 § 1, 2005.)

19.06.120 Review and update of impact fees.

19.08.010 Findings and authority.
The council of the city of Auburn (the “council”) hereby finds and determines that new growth and residential development in the city of Auburn will create additional demand and need for parks and recreation facilities in the city of Auburn, and the council finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of parks and recreation facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The city of Auburn has conducted a study documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new developments on parks and recreation facilities. This study has contributed to the rates as established in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn. Therefore, pursuant to Chapter 82.02 RCW, the council adopts this chapter to assess impact fees for parks and recreation facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the council in establishing the impact fee program. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

A. Effective January 1, 2007, the city shall collect park impact fees, based on the fee schedule of the city of Auburn, from any applicant seeking development approval from the city for any development activity that includes dwelling units within the city. The park impact fees established hereby shall be listed on the city of Auburn fee schedule according to service area. Two service areas are established within Auburn. The downtown catalyst park service area, as defined in ACC 19.08.020(AA), and the city-wide service area, which is defined as all other property within the city boundaries that is outside the downtown catalyst park service area. Credits, adjustments, and exemptions set forth in this chapter shall apply equally to both areas.
B. Effective January 1, 2007, where a change in use increases housing capacity by more than or equal to one dwelling unit, the director shall calculate a parks and recreation impact fee based on the increase in the housing capacity.
C. The amount of impact fees shall be determined at the time an applicant submits a complete application for a building permit using the impact fee schedules then in effect, or pursuant to an independent fee calculation accepted by the director pursuant to ACC 19.08.040, and adjusted for any credits pursuant to ACC 19.08.050.
D. Payment of impact fees shall be made by the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued for each unit in the development. The amount to be paid shall not be increased for any applicant that submitted a complete application for the building permit before the city established the impact fee rates.
E. Applicants that have been awarded credits prior to the submittal of the complete building permit application pursuant to ACC 19.08.050 shall submit, along with the complete building permit application, a copy of the letter or certificate prepared by the director pursuant to ACC 19.08.050 setting forth the dollar amount of the credit awarded. Impact fees, as determined after the application of appropriate credits, shall be collected from the feepayer at the time the building permit is issued.
F. The department shall not issue a building permit unless and until the impact fees have been paid or credit(s) awarded.
G. For complete single-family building permit applications for new development, redevelopment or a change in use, and prior to or at the time of issuance of any single-family residential building permit for a dwelling unit that is being constructed, the applicant may elect to record a covenant against title to the property on forms prepared and provided by the city that requires payment of parks impact fees due and owing, less any credits awarded, by providing for automatic payment through escrow of these development charges due and owing to be paid no later than at time of closing of the sale of the unit or at final inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (G)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full.
    3. The appeals process authorized in ACC 19.08.070 shall not apply to determinations made pursuant to this section.
H. For complete multifamily building permit applications for new development, redevelopment or a change in use, and prior to or at the time of issuance of any multifamily residential building permit that is being constructed, the applicant may elect to record a covenant against title to the property on forms prepared and provided by the city that requires payment of parks impact fees due and owing, less any credits awarded, by providing for automatic payment through escrow of these development charges due and owing to be paid no later than at time of closing of the sale of the unit or at final inspection or issuance of certificate of occupancy or 18 months from the date of issuance of the original building permit, whichever comes first. Failure to pay shall result in the following:
    1. If 30 days after the city has sent the responsible party written notification of its obligation to pay the charges established in this chapter the full amount remains unpaid, the responsible party shall be subject to the enforcement provisions of ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065. Written notification shall be by regular and certified mail and to the most current available contact information on file with the city. For the purposes of applying ACC 1.25.030 and 1.25.065, the responsible party shall constitute a property owner, the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued shall constitute the property(ies) on which the violation is occurring, and the impact fee amount remaining unpaid shall constitute a violation occurring on the permitted property(ies) under these sections.
    2. Any unpaid charges adopted by this chapter that are outstanding 30 days from the date the charges are due shall constitute a lien against the property(ies) for which a permit(s) has been issued in the amount of the unpaid charges. In addition to the actions authorized in subsection (H)(1) of this section, the city may record a lien against the permitted property(ies) in the amount of the unpaid charges and may immediately suspend any permits previously issued for the lot or unit associated with the current development activity and shall limit the granting of any future permits for the lot or unit until such time that all outstanding water, sanitary sewer and storm drainage development charges are paid in full.
    3. The appeals process authorized in ACC 19.08.070 shall not apply to determinations made pursuant to this section. (Ord. 6637 § 3, 2017; Ord. 6455 § 5, 2013; Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.040 Independent fee calculations.
A. If, in the judgment of the director, none of the fee categories or fee amounts set forth in the fee schedule accurately describes or captures the impacts of the new development, the applicant shall conduct an independent fee calculation and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations, once accepted by the city.
B. Feepayers may opt not to have the impact fees determined according to the fee schedule. Such feepayers shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.
C. A nonreimbursable administrative fee shall be charged for each independent fee calculation. The fee shall be deposited with the city to pay for city review of the independent fee calculation upon submittal of the documented independent fee study.
D. After the city completes its review, the actual fees and expenses will be determined and the cash deposit shall be adjusted to provide for a refund by the city or additional payment by the feepayer.
E. While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in the fee schedule are valid, the director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer, but is not required to accept such documentation which the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or where adjustment is deemed by the director to be appropriate based on principles of fairness under the circumstances of the case.
F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the office of the hearing examiner subject to the procedures set forth in ACC 19.08.070. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.050 Credits and adjustments.
A. A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for parks and recreation impact fees be awarded to him/her for parks and recreation improvement projects provided by the feepayer in excess of the standard requirements for the feepayer’s development if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are identified as parks and recreation system improvements that provide capacity to serve new growth in the capital facilities plan, or the director, at his/her discretion, makes the finding that such land, improvements, and/or facilities would serve the parks and recreation goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan.
B. For each request for a credit or credits, the director shall determine the value of dedicated land by using available documentation or selecting an appraiser from a list of independent appraisers maintained by the department to determine the value of the land being dedicated. The value of improvements will be determined through documentation submitted by the feepayer.
C. The feepayer shall pay the cost of the appraisal and shall deposit on account the estimated cost of the appraisal as determined by the city at the time the feepayer requests consideration for a credit.
D. After receiving the appraisal, the director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, where applicable, the legal description of the site donated, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 days shall nullify the credit.
E. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.
F. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in ACC 19.08.070.
G. Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the fee rate in the fee schedule has been reasonably adjusted for other revenue sources which are earmarked for, or proratable to, funding parks and recreation facilities.
H. In order to grandfather the capacity rights of existing developments, the director will utilize the adopted rates to calculate any impact fee credits and to determine any surplus credits for off-site system improvements made by the property owner.
Only in a situation when a property owner makes off-site system capacity improvements that qualify in accordance with subsection A of this section will any surplus credits (value computed during the permit year and not adjusted for inflation) remain with the property or any subdivision of that property to benefit future development where a parks and recreation impact fee is determined to be due. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.060 Exemptions.
A. The following shall be exempted from the payment of parks and recreation impact fees:
    1. Replacement of a structure with a new structure of the same use at the same site or lot when such replacement occurs within 12 months of the demolition or destruction of the prior structure.
    2. Alterations or expansion or enlargement or remodeling or rehabilitation or conversion of an existing dwelling unit where no additional units are created and the use is not changed.
    3. Miscellaneous improvements, including but not limited to fences, walls, swimming pools, and signs.
    4. A change in use where the increase in housing capacity is less than the threshold stated in ACC 19.08.030(B).
    5. Demolition or moving of a structure.
    6. Any building permit application that has been submitted to the department before 5:00 p.m. the business day before the first effective date of the park impact fee rate schedule and subsequently determined to be a complete application by the city.
B. The director shall be authorized to determine whether a particular development activity falls within an exemption identified in this section. Determinations of the director shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in ACC 19.08.070. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.070 Appeals.
A. Any feepayer may pay the impact fees imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a building permit. Appeals regarding the impact fees imposed on any development activity may only be made by the feepayer of the property where such development activity will occur. No appeal submitted under protest shall be permitted unless and until the impact fees at issue have been paid. Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the director without first paying the fees, providing the applicant is willing to provide a satisfactory security of the appealed fee amount in accordance with the requirements of ACC 17.14.010(A) prior to issuance of the building permit. Alternatively, any feepayer may appeal the impact fees determined by the director without first paying the fees, provided the applicant is willing to postpone issuance of the building permit until after the appeal process when the revised final fee is known.
B. Determinations of the director with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or value of a credit, or the director’s decision with respect to the independent fee calculation, or any other determination which the director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, can be appealed to the hearing examiner.
C. Appeals shall be taken within 10 days of the director’s issuance of a written determination by filing with the office of the hearing examiner a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof and depositing the necessary fee, which is set forth in the existing fee schedules for appeals of administrative decisions. The director shall transmit to the office of the hearing examiner all papers constituting the record for the determination, including, where appropriate, the independent fee calculation.
D. The hearing examiner shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal, give notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same as provided in Chapter 2.46 ACC. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.
E. The hearing examiner is authorized to make findings of fact regarding the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or amount of the credit, or the accuracy or applicability of an independent fee calculation. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final, except as provided in subsection G of this section.
F. The hearing examiner may, so long as such action is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the determinations of the director with respect to the amount of the impact fees imposed or the credit awarded upon a determination that it is proper to do so based on principles of fairness, and may make such order, requirements, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers which have been granted to the director by this chapter.
G. Any feepayer aggrieved by any decision of the office of the hearing examiner may appeal the hearing examiner’s final decision as provided in Chapter 2.46 ACC. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.080 Establishment of impact fee account for parks and recreation.
A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and deposited in special interest-bearing accounts. The fees received shall be prudently invested in a manner consistent with the investment policies of the city.
B. There is hereby established a separate impact fee account for the fees collected pursuant to this chapter: the parks and recreation facilities impact fee account. Funds withdrawn from these accounts must be used in accordance with the provisions of ACC 19.08.100. Interest earned on the fees shall be retained in the account and expended for the purposes for which the impact fees were collected.
C. On an annual basis, the financial director shall provide a report to the council on the parks and recreation impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the parks and recreation system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.
D. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within six years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings an extraordinary and compelling reason or reasons for the delay. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.090 Refunds.
A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within six years of when the fees were paid or, where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as established pursuant to ACC 19.08.080, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first-in, first-out basis; provided, that any party that voluntarily elects to use the alternative fee payment method specified in ACC 19.08.030 shall sign as a condition of use of the alternative fee payment method a waiver of right on a form prepared and provided by the city to recovery of park impact fees not spent with the statutory six-year timeframe.
B. The city shall notify potential claimants by first class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of such claimants. A potential claimant or claimant must be the owner of the property.
C. Owners seeking a refund of impact fees must submit a written request for a refund of the fees to the director within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever is later.
D. Any impact fees for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period shall be retained by the city and expended on the appropriate parks and recreation facilities.
E. Refunds of impact fees under this section shall include any interest earned on the impact fees by the city.
F. If and when the city seeks to terminate any or all components of the parks and recreation impact fee program, all unexpended or unencumbered funds from any terminated component or components, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail to the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the appropriate parks and recreation facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within an account or accounts being terminated.
G. The city shall also refund to the developer of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.100 Use of funds.
A. Pursuant to this chapter, impact fees:
    1. Shall be used for parks and recreation system improvements that will reasonably benefit the new development; and
    2. Shall not be imposed to make up for deficiencies in parks and recreation facilities serving existing developments; and
    3. Shall not be used for maintenance or operations.
B. As a general guideline, parks and recreation impact fees may be used for any parks and recreation system improvements which could otherwise be funded by a bond issue of the city.
C. Parks and recreation facilities impact fees may be spent for parks and recreation system improvements, including but not limited to neighborhood and community parks, recreational trails, athletic fields, swimming pools, and community centers, including planning, land acquisition, site improvements, necessary off-site improvements including mitigation, construction, engineering, architectural, permitting, financing, and administrative expenses, applicable impact fees or mitigation costs, and any other expenses which can be capitalized.
D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of parks and recreation system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.110 Review and update of impact fees.
A. The fee rate schedules set forth in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn shall be reviewed by the council no later than two years after the effective date of the fee rate schedule attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter, and no more than every two years thereafter.
B. The fee schedules set forth in the fee schedule of the city of Auburn shall be reviewed by the council as it may deem necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the annual update of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

19.08.120 Miscellaneous provisions.
A. Existing Authority Unimpaired. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from requiring the feepayer or the proponent of a development activity to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a specific development pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act, Chapter 43.21C RCW, based on the environmental documents accompanying the underlying development approval process, and/or Chapter 58.17 RCW, governing plats and subdivisions; provided, that the exercise of this authority is consistent with the provisions of RCW 82.02.050(1)(c).
B. Captions. The chapter and section captions used in this chapter are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions of this chapter.
C. Severability. If any portion of this chapter is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such finding shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other section of this chapter.
D. Short Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as “the city of Auburn parks and recreation impact fee ordinance.” (Ord. 6341 § 5, 2011; Ord. 6063 § 1, 2006.)

F. The service that applicant will provide to the community and region;
G. The effect, if any, on public health, safety and welfare if the franchise requested is granted;
H. The availability of alternate routes and/or locations for the proposed facilities;
I. Applicable federal and state utility and telecommunications laws, regulations and policies;
J. The ability to avoid, or mitigate to the city’s satisfaction, future conflicts with the operation, repair, replacement, and maintenance of city-owned and other commercial utilities;
K. The ability of the applicant to stabilize existing pavement structures prior to disturbance in a manner sufficient to ensure future deterioration is not accelerated by virtue of the installed facilities, and/or the ability and willingness of the applicant to fully mitigate such damages to the extent that they may prove unavoidable to the satisfaction of the city. Such security for the pavement’s integrity may include additional periods of warranty bonding for up to five years from date of completion of work as determined by the city engineer;
L. Demonstrated ability and commitment to meet city bonding and security requirements established in ACC 20.10.240 through 20.10.260 and Chapter 12.24 ACC; and

(Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.060 Nonexclusive franchise.

20.06.070 Term of franchise.
By virtue of the uncertainties created by the Act, unless otherwise specified in an existing franchise agreement, a telecommunications franchise granted by the city pursuant to this title shall be valid for a term not to exceed five years. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.080 Rights granted.
No franchise granted under this chapter shall convey any right, title or interest in the public ways, but shall be deemed a franchise only to use and occupy the public ways for the limited purposes and term stated in the franchise. Further, no franchise shall be construed as any warranty of title. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.110 Nondiscrimination.
A franchisee which purports to serve the general public shall make its utility or telecommunications services available to any customer within its franchise area who shall request such service, without discrimination as to the terms, conditions, rates or charges for the franchisee’s services; provided, however, that nothing in this title shall prohibit a franchisee from making any reasonable classifications among differently situated customers. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.120 Amendment of franchise.
Except as otherwise provided within an existing franchise ordinance, a new franchise application shall be required of any commercial utility or telecommunications carrier or operator that desires to extend its franchise territory or to locate its utility or telecommunications facilities in public ways of the city which are not included in a franchise previously granted under this title. If a franchisee is required by the city to locate or relocate its facilities in public ways not included in a previously granted franchise, the city shall grant a franchise amendment without further application. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.130 Renewal of franchise.
A franchisee that desires to renew its franchise under this chapter for an additional five-year term shall, not more than 240 days nor less than 180 days before expiration of the franchise in effect, file an application, which is determined as complete in accordance with ACC 20.06.030, with the city for a renewal of its franchise which shall include the following:

Within 120 calendar days after receiving a complete application for renewal, following the procedures in ACC 20.06.030, the city council shall grant or deny the renewal application in whole or in part. If the renewal application is denied, the written determination shall include the reason(s) for denial. Prior to granting or denying renewal of a franchise under this chapter, in whole or in part, the city council shall conduct a public hearing and make a decision based upon the criteria set forth below in addition to all criteria in ACC 20.06.040.
A. The continuing capacity of the public ways to accommodate the applicant’s existing facilities.

20.06.160 Reserved.
(Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

In addition, all franchisees shall, within 30 days after written demand, reimburse the city for any and all costs the city reasonably incurs in response to any emergency involving the franchisee’s utility or telecommunications facilities. Finally, all franchisees shall, within 30 days after written demand, reimburse the city for the franchisee’s proportionate share of all actual, identified expenses incurred by the city in planning, constructing, installing, repairing or altering any city facility as a result of the presence in the public way of the franchisee’s utility or telecommunications facilities. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.180 Compensation for use of public ways.
A. The city finds that the public ways to be used by commercial utilities and carriers and operators in the operation of telecommunications systems within the boundaries of the franchise are valuable public properties, acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant of use of said public ways is a valuable property right, without which grantees and franchisees would be required to invest substantial capital in public way costs and acquisitions; therefore, grantees and franchisees shall pay the city as a general compensation for the use of the public way during each year of the term of a franchise a franchise fee as determined by city council, not to exceed six percent of gross revenues for each quarter of each calendar year. Franchisees shall pay the franchise fee mandated by this chapter but the city acknowledges and understands that such amount (and any other fees, assessments, or taxes imposed on franchisees not described in subsection E of this section) shall appear as a line item on the bill sent to, and shall be collected from, the subscribers; provided further, that the compensation required from any telecommunications operator or carrier engaged in the “telephone business,” as defined in RCW 82.04.065, shall be consistent with RCW 35.21.860.
B. Annual Franchise Fee Adjustments. The initial annual franchise fee percentage shall be the amount permitted by law of gross revenues unless and until it is further adjusted by city council. Any such adjustment shall occur at least 60 days before any subsequent annual anniversary date. Any adjustment shall become effective on the subsequent annual anniversary date.
C. Quarterly Payment. Franchisees shall forward by check wire transfer an amount equal to this quarterly payment by the fifteenth day of the second calendar month immediately following the close of the calendar quarter for which the payment is calculated.
D. Late Payment. In the event any quarterly payment is made after noon on the date 10 days after the date due, franchisees shall pay a late payment penalty as shown in the city’s fee schedule.
E. Fees and Compensation Not a Tax. The fees, charges and fines provided for in this title and any compensation charged and paid for the franchisee’s use of the city’s public ways, whether “fiduciary or in kind,” are separate from, and additional to, any and all federal, state, local and city taxes as may be levied, imposed or due from a commercial utility, telecommunications carrier, operator, or provider, its customers or subscribers or on account of the lease, sale, delivery or transmission of utility or telecommunications services.
F. Ruling of Unenforceability. The compensation required from any commercial utility, telecommunications carrier, operator, or provider shall be as provided by law. In the event any franchise fee shall be held unenforceable by a court of law which has jurisdiction over the city, franchisees shall pay the equivalent amount paid in franchise fees as a city utility tax which shall be applied retroactively to time periods during which the franchise fee was determined to be unenforceable.
G. Quarterly Report. In order to properly determine the gross revenues received by franchisees, the franchisee shall, on the same date that each quarterly payment is made, file with the director of finance a sworn copy of a report, in a form acceptable to the city, in sufficient detail to itemize revenues from each of the revenue categories. The city may, if it sees fit and at its own expense, have the books and records of franchisees examined by a representative of said city to ascertain the correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein. Neither the acceptance of any payment nor any subsequent review shall be deemed an agreement by the city that the correct payment was paid, absent a fully authorized written release by the city on any such payments or on such reports. Any necessary prorations shall be made in the first and last year of each term of the franchise. Any city request for access to books and records shall be allowed by the franchisee at reasonable times and for reasonable purposes. Such information shall be held in strict confidence by the city as allowed by law and used only for the purpose stated herein.
H. Recalculation at End of Compensation Year. At the end of each calendar year, franchisees shall recalculate the total general compensation actually due. If additional amounts are due the city by franchisee, said amounts shall be paid by the fifteenth day of February following the calendar year during which such amounts were originally due. If amounts are found to be due the franchisees by the city, said amounts shall be credited by the fifteenth day of February during which such amounts were originally due. Any necessary prorations will be made.
I. Taxes Are Not to Be a Credit. The compensation paid under this franchise shall be exclusive of and in addition to all special assessments and taxes of whatever nature which are applicable to all other persons or entities doing business within the city, including, but not limited to, ad valorem tax, sales tax, corporate or business occupation taxes or other taxes or fees imposed or levied by any governmental entity.
J. Utility Tax Liability – Franchise Fees. Revenues derived directly or indirectly from sources within the city shall be subject to applicable utility taxes as of the time of commencement of such operations. Franchise fees shall be in addition to any utility tax, but shall be collectible only to the extent as then allowed by law, and in no event may the combined utility tax and franchise fee exceed six percent of gross revenues in accordance with RCW 35.21.870. Franchise fees, if applicable, shall be levied on a nondiscriminatory basis.
K. Rights of City. Payment of money under any franchise shall not in any way limit or inhibit any of the privileges or rights of the city, except insofar as city’s privileges or rights are expressly limited or inhibited by the terms of a franchise.
L. Annual Report. Franchisees shall file annually with the director of finance, no later than 90 days after the end of franchisee’s fiscal year, an unaudited statement of revenues (for that fiscal year just ended) attributable to the operations of the franchisee’s telecommunications system within the city pursuant to the franchise agreement. The statement shall present a detailed breakdown of gross revenues and uncollectible accounts for the year. The city may, if it sees fit, have such report audited by an independent certified public accountant of its choosing. If the audit reveals an underpayment error in payment by franchisees of more than five percent, then franchisees shall pay for the costs of the audit. If the audit reveals an error in payment of five percent or less, the city shall pay the costs of the audit. The report will summarize those accounts reconciled to be within the franchise area by the city’s quarterly review.
M. Circumventing Payments. Any transaction(s) which have the effect of circumventing payment of the required franchise fees and/or evasion of payment of franchise fees or any payments due the city under a franchise by noncollection or nonreporting of gross revenues, bartering, or any other means which evade the actual collection of revenues for business pursued by franchisees are prohibited.
N. Best Rates. As allowed by applicable law, part of the compensation to the city for the grant of any telecommunications franchise, the city shall be entitled to obtain subscriptions, at the city’s discretion, to the communications service at franchisee’s lowest comparable rate applicable to any government body or municipality of the state of Washington. In addition, city shall be entitled to franchisee’s lowest comparable rate applicable to any governmental body or municipality of the state of Washington for purchase and/or lease, should the city determine to purchase and/or lease equipment or modems applicable to government bodies or municipalities in the state of Washington for purposes of accessing the communications service. (Ord. 6718 § 3 (Exh. C), 2019; Ord. 6546 § 8, 2014; Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.06.190 Accounts, books and records.
The franchisee shall keep the city fully informed as to accounting methods and procedures in connection with the recording and reporting by the franchisee of all revenues and uncollectibles.
A. City to Be Informed. Franchisees shall keep the city fully informed as to all matters in connection with or which may affect the construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance, operation and repair of franchisee’s system located in public way(s), franchisee’s accounting methods and procedures in connection therewith, and the recording and reporting by franchisees of all revenues and uncollectibles. Franchisees shall comply with the city’s determination regarding forms for reports, the time for reports, the frequency with which any reports are to be made, and whether reports are to be made under oath. The city acknowledges that a franchisee may be a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that shares of its stock are publicly traded. As such, a franchisee may be precluded from disclosing certain sensitive, nonpublic information by virtue of rules and regulations promulgated under such act or otherwise.
B. Accounts. The franchisee shall keep complete and accurate books of account and records of its business and operations subject to this franchise chapter in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or in accordance with accounting rules prescribed by applicable federal or state regulatory agencies. The city may require the keeping of additional records or accounts which are reasonably necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for, and reporting gross revenues and uncollectibles. All subscribers who report a service address in the city of Auburn shall be subject to taxes and fees under this franchise. When required by the city, the franchisee shall make available a complete list of all service addresses within the city of Auburn. This list shall be available for review by the city at a local franchisee’s business office. The list will be provided on a computer disc in ASCII format sorted by zip code. It is understood this data is only needed for Auburn to perform an audit to ascertain that the correct subscribers are subjected to Auburn taxes and fees. As the city annexes new areas, those zip codes, if any, will be added.
C. Access to Records. The franchisee shall provide the city with access at reasonable times and for reasonable purposes, to examine, audit, review and/or obtain copies of the papers, books, accounts, documents, maps, plans and other records of the franchisee pertaining to this franchise chapter. The franchisee shall fully cooperate in making available its records and otherwise assisting in these activities. Such information shall be held in strict confidence by the city, as allowed by law, and used only for the purpose stated herein.
D. Inquiries to Franchisee. The city may, at any time, make inquiries pertaining to the franchisee’s operation of its utility or telecommunications system within the franchise area. The franchisee shall respond to such inquiries on a timely basis. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

Upon the city council’s decision, the finance director shall notify the applicant of the decision and instruct the applicant of the procedure to follow to complete execution of the lease agreement if approved by the city council.

20.08.080 Rights granted.

Further, no facilities lease shall be construed as any warranty of title. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.090 Interference with other users.
No facilities lease shall be granted under this title unless it contains a provision which is substantially similar to the following:The City has previously entered into leases with other tenants for their equipment and telecommunications facilities. Lessee acknowledges that the City is also leasing the City property for the purposes of transmitting and receiving telecommunications signals from the City property. The City, however, is not in any way responsible or liable for any interference with Lessee’s use of the City property which may be caused by the use and operation of any other tenant’s equipment, even if caused by new technology. In the event that any other tenant’s activities interfere with the Lessee’s use of the City property, and the Lessee cannot work out this interference with the other tenants, the Lessee may, upon 30 days’ notice to the City, terminate this Lease and restore the City property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The Lessee shall cooperate with all other tenants to identify the causes of, and work towards the resolution of, any electronic interference problem. In addition, the Lessee agrees to eliminate any radio or television interference caused to City-owned or other public/private facilities or surrounding property owners, residents, or tenants at Lessee’s own expense and without installation of extra filters on City-owned equipment. Lessee further agrees to accept such interference as may be received from City operated telecommunications or other facilities located upon the City property subject to this Lease.
(Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.100 Ownership and removal of improvements.
No facilities lease shall be granted under this title unless it contains a provision which states that all buildings, landscaping, and all other improvements, except lessee’s equipment, shall become the property of the city upon expiration or termination of the lease. In the event that the city requires removal of such improvements, such removal shall be accomplished at the sole expense of the lessee and completed with full restoration of the site to the original condition or its practical equivalent as determined by the city, within 90 days after receiving written notice from the city requiring removal of the improvements. Further, in the event that utility or telecommunications facilities or other equipment are left upon city property after expiration or termination of the lease, they shall become the property of the city if not removed by the lessee after 30 days’ written notice from the city. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.110 Cancellation of lease by lessee.
A. All facilities leases are contingent upon the prospective lessee obtaining all necessary permits, approvals, and licenses for the proposed facilities. In the event that the prospective lessee is unable to obtain all such permits, approvals, and licenses, it may cancel its lease, and obtain a pro rata refund in any rents paid, without further obligation by giving 30 days’ prior written notice to the city.
B. In the event that the holder of a facilities lease determines that the city property is unsuitable for its intended purpose, the lessee shall have the right to cancel the lease upon 120 days’ written notice to the city. However, no prepaid rent shall be refundable. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.120 Compensation to the city.
Each facilities lease granted under this title is subject to the city’s right, which is expressly reserved, to annually fix a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid for the rights granted to a lessee; provided, nothing in this title shall prohibit the city and a lessee from agreeing to the compensation to be paid. Such compensation shall be payable in advance of the effective date of the lease and on or before January 31st of each calendar year. Any payments received after the due date shall include a late payment penalty of two percent of the annual rental fee for each day or part thereof past the due date. If any or all of the rental fee is more than 60 calendar days delinquent, the lease will automatically terminate on the sixty-first calendar day of delinquency, and the city may proceed to collect against any security provided by the lessee. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.130 Amendment of facilities lease.
Except as provided within an existing lease agreement, a new lease application and lease agreement shall be required of any lessee that desires to expand, modify, or relocate its facilities or other equipment located upon city property. If the lessee is required by the city to locate or relocate its facilities or other equipment on the city property, the city shall grant a lease amendment without further application. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.140 Renewal of facilities lease.
A lessee that desires to renew its facilities lease in effect under this chapter shall, not more than 120 days nor less than 90 days before expiration of the facilities lease then in effect, file an application, which is determined as complete in accordance with ACC 20.08.030, with the city for renewal of its facilities lease which shall include the following:
A. The information required pursuant to ACC 20.08.020;
B. Any information required pursuant to the facilities lease agreement between the city and the lessee;
C. All deposits or charges required pursuant to this chapter;
D. A nonrefundable application renewal fee in the amount established in the city’s fee schedule. (Ord. 6718 § 4 (Exh. D), 2019; Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.150 Determination by the city for renewal of facility lease.
All renewals of leases subject to this title shall be renewed in accordance with the provisions of ACC 20.08.030 and 20.08.040. Recognizing that the city council is under no obligation to approve a renewal of a facilities lease for the use of city property, the city council shall attempt to consider and take action on applications for renewal of such leases within 90 days after receiving a complete application for such a lease renewal. When such action is taken, the city shall issue a written determination granting or denying the lease renewal, in whole or in part. If the renewal application is denied, the written determination shall include the reason(s) for denial. The decision to grant or deny an application for renewal of a facilities lease shall be based upon, but not limited to, the following:
A. The continuing capacity of the city property to accommodate the applicant’s existing facilities.
B. The applicant’s compliance with the requirements of this title and the lease agreement.
C. Such other factors as may demonstrate that the continued approval to use the city property ways will serve the community interest.
D. Any criteria contained in ACC 20.08.040. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.08.160 Obligation to cure as a condition of renewal.
No facilities lease shall be renewed until any ongoing violations or defaults in the lessee’s performance of the lease agreement, or of the requirements of this title, have been cured, or a plan, secured by bond or deposit account to the city’s satisfaction, detailing the corrective action to be taken by the lessee has been approved in writing by the city. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.010 Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to set forth certain terms and conditions which are common to all public way agreements, franchises, and facilities leases granted under the provisions of this title. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or in such a public way agreement, franchise, or lease, the provisions of this chapter apply to all such public way agreements, franchises, and leases approved or granted by the city. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.020 Acceptance and effective date.
No public way agreement, franchise, or lease granted pursuant to the provisions of this title shall become effective unless and until the ordinance or other city action granting the same has become effective. Within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance or other city action granting a public way agreement, franchise, or lease, or within such extended period of time as the council in its discretion may authorize, the applicant shall file with the city clerk an unconditional written acceptance of the public way agreement, franchise, or lease, in a form satisfactory to the city attorney, together with the bonds, insurance policies, and security fund required by this title. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.030 Police power.
In accepting and executing any public way agreement, franchise or lease, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee acknowledges that its rights thereunder are subject to the legitimate rights of the police power of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public, and agrees to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such power. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.040 Rules and regulations by the city.
In addition to the inherent powers of the city to regulate and control any public way agreement, franchise, or lease granted, the authority granted to the city by the Cable Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and those powers expressly reserved by the city, or agreed to and provided for in any public way agreement, franchise, or lease, the right and power is hereby reserved by the city to promulgate such additional regulations as it may find necessary in the exercise of its lawful powers giving due regard to the rights of grantees, franchisees, and lessees. Except as provided in this title, the foregoing does not allow for amendment by the city of material terms of any public way agreement, franchise, or lease granted without the written consent of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.050 Location of facilities.
All facilities shall be constructed, installed, and located in accordance with the following terms and conditions, unless otherwise specified in a public way agreement, franchise, or lease agreement.
A. Unless otherwise provided in a public way agreement, franchise, or lease, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee with permission to occupy a public way must locate its cable or telecommunications facilities underground in accordance with ACC Title 18 and Chapter 13.32 ACC.
B. Any newcomer in the public way must bear the full cost of discovering the location of any existing conflicts, coordination of the engineering plans to acquire the approvals of parties already in the public way, and relocating and/or mitigating such conflicts with preexisting facilities in conflict with the plans of the newcomer.
C. Whenever the city requires, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee subject to this title, that currently occupies the public way shall relocate its facilities underground at no expense to the city. Such relocation shall be made concurrently with other planned work to minimize the disruption of the public ways as determined by the city engineer.
D. Should the available capacity of public ways prevent new uses in the future, all persons subject to this title shall negotiate with any interested newcomer the means of creating new capacity as required by federal or state law. The parties shall arrive at a mutually supportable agreement and submit the same to the city for review and comment. The parties will incorporate any reasonable city requirements for approval, and resubmit the revised proposal for city council approval. If approved by the city council, the parties will bear all costs associated with the proposal, and obtain the necessary permits to execute the approved plan from the city in accordance with this title and Chapter 12.24 ACC. The city shall bear no costs associated with resolution of capacity shortages within the public ways. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.060 Compliance with one number locator service.
All grantees, franchisees, and lessees shall, before commencing any construction in the public ways, comply with all regulations of Chapter 19.122 RCW, the One Number Locator Service. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.070 Construction permits.
All grantees of public way agreements, franchisees, and lessees of city properties are required to obtain construction permits, as required in Chapter 12.24 ACC, for installing utility, cable and telecommunications facilities. However, nothing in this title shall prohibit the city and a grantee, franchisee, or lessee from agreeing to alternative plan review, permit, and construction procedures for a public way agreement, franchise, or lease granted under this title, provided such alternative procedures provide substantially equivalent safeguards for responsible construction practices. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.080 Interference with the public ways.
No grantee, franchisee, or lessee may locate or maintain its utility, cable or telecommunications facilities so as to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public ways by the city, by the general public or by other persons authorized to use or be present in or upon the public ways. All such facilities which unreasonably interfere with the use of the city’s public ways as determined by the public works director, shall be moved in accordance with provisions in ACC 20.10.130, by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, at the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s cost, temporarily or permanently, as determined by the public works director. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.090 Damage to property.
No grantee, franchisee, or lessee, nor any person acting on behalf of a grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall take any action or permit any action to be taken which may impair or damage any city property, public ways of the city, other ways or other property, whether publicly or privately owned, located in, on or adjacent thereto. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.100 Notice of work.
Unless otherwise provided in a public way agreement, franchise, or lease agreement, no grantee, franchisee, or lessee, nor any person acting on behalf of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall commence any nonemergency work in or about the public ways of the city, other ways, or upon city property without 10 working days’ advance written notice to the city which notice shall include the location of the work to be done, a detailed description of the work to be done, and a schedule for completion. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.110 Repair and emergency work.
In the event of an emergency, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee may commence such repair and emergency response work as required under the circumstances, provided the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall notify the city in writing as promptly as possible, before such repair or emergency work commences or as soon thereafter as possible if advance notice is not practicable. The city may act without prior written notice in case of emergency. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.120 Maintenance of facilities.
Each grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall maintain its facilities in good and safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state and local requirements. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.130 Abandonment, relocation or removal of facilities.
Within 30 days following written notice from the city, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall, at its sole expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change, or alter the position of any commercial utility, cable or telecommunications facilities within the public ways or upon city property whenever the city public works director shall have determined that such removal, relocation, change, or alteration is reasonably necessary for:
A. The construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any city or other public improvement in or upon the public ways; and
B. The operations of the city, utility providers, or other governmental entity in or upon the public ways; and
C. Facilities are deemed by the city as abandoned due to failure to cure of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee.
However, in the event such relocation is required due to emergency repairs deemed necessary by the city, such relocation or moving shall be accomplished within 24 hours. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.140 Building moving.
Whenever any person shall have obtained permission from the city to use any street or public way for the purpose of moving any building, a grantee, franchisee, or lessee, upon seven calendar days’ written notice from the city, shall raise or remove, at the expense of the person desiring to move the building, any of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s utility wires, poles, or facilities which may obstruct the moving of such building; provided, that the person desiring to move the building shall comply with all requirements of the city for the moving of buildings. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.150 Removal of unauthorized facilities.
Within 30 days following written notice from the city, any commercial utility, telecommunications carrier, operator, lessee or other person who owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized cable or telecommunications system, facility, or related appurtenances within the public ways or upon property of the city shall, at its own expense, remove such facilities or appurtenances from the public ways of the city. A utility, cable or telecommunications system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:
A. Upon expiration or termination of the grantee, lessee, or franchisee’s public way agreement, franchise, or lease;
B. Upon leaving any system or facility within the public ways or upon property of the city, any such property of a grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall be deemed abandoned if left in place 90 days after expiration or termination of a public way agreement, franchise, or lease;
C. If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior approval of a public way agreement, franchise or lease;
D. If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior issuance of a required construction permit;
E. If the system or facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by a public way agreement, franchise or lease.
Provided, however, that the city may, in its sole discretion, allow a grantee, franchisee, or lessee or other such persons who may own, control, use, or maintain commercial utility, cable or telecommunications facilities within the public ways of the city or upon city property to abandon such facilities in place. No facilities of any type may be abandoned in place without the express written consent of the city. Any plan for abandonment or removal of a grantee’s, franchisee’s, or lessee’s facilities must be first approved by the public works director, and all necessary permits must be obtained prior to such work. Upon permanent abandonment in place of the facilities such facilities shall become the city’s property, and such persons shall submit to the city an instrument in writing, to be approved by the city attorney, transferring to the city the ownership of such property. The provisions of this section shall survive the expiration, revocation, or termination of a public way agreement, franchise, or lease granted under this title. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.160 Emergency removal or relocation of facilities.
The city retains the right and privilege to cut or move any commercial utility, cable or telecommunications facilities located within the public ways of the city and upon city property, as the city may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. The city shall not be liable to any utility, cable operator, telecommunications carrier, operator, or provider, or any other party for any direct, indirect, or any other such damages suffered by any person or entity of any type as a direct or indirect result of the city’s actions under this section. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.170 Damage to facilities.
Unless directly and proximately caused by the willful, intentional, or malicious acts by the city, the city shall not be liable for any damage to or loss of any commercial utility, cable, or telecommunications facilities upon city property or within the public ways of the city as a result of or in connection with any public works, public improvements, construction, excavation, grading, filling, or work of any kind on such city property or within the public ways by or on behalf of the city. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.180 Restoration of public ways, other ways, city property and public/private utility property.
A. When a grantee, franchisee, lessee, or any person acting on behalf such persons, does any work in or affecting any public ways, other ways, city property, or public/private utilities located in the public ways, it shall, at its own expense, promptly remove any obstructions therefrom and restore such ways or property to as good a condition as existed before the work was undertaken, unless otherwise directed by the city.
B. If weather or other conditions do not permit the complete restoration required by this section, or other city codes, regulations or policies, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall temporarily restore the affected public ways, other ways, or property. Such temporary restoration shall be at the grantee’s, franchisee’s, or lessee’s sole expense and the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the weather or other conditions no longer prevent such permanent restoration.
C. A grantee, franchisee, lessee or other person acting on behalf of such persons shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares, and other measures as required for the safety of all members of the general public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle, or property by reason of such work in or affecting such public ways, other ways, or property.
D. The public works director shall be responsible for inspection and final approval of the condition of the public ways, other ways, and city property following any construction and restoration activities therein. Further, the provisions of this section shall survive the expiration, revocation, or termination of a public way agreement, franchise, lease, or other agreement granted pursuant to this title or Chapter 12.24 ACC. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.190 Facilities maps.
Each grantee, franchisee, and lessee shall provide the city with a map or maps accurately reflecting the horizontal and vertical location and configuration of all of their commercial utility or telecommunications facilities within the public ways and upon city property. Each grantee, franchisee, and lessee shall provide the city with updated maps annually or upon written request by the city. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

All books, records, maps and other documents, maintained by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee with respect to its utility or telecommunications facilities within the public ways and upon city property shall be made available for inspection by the city at reasonable times and intervals; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to require a grantee, franchisee, or lessee to violate state or federal law regarding subscriber privacy, nor shall this section be construed to require a grantee, franchisee, or lessee to disclose proprietary or confidential information without adequate safeguards for its confidential or proprietary nature. Such information shall be held in strict confidence, as allowed by law, by the city and used only for the purpose stated herein. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

A grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall have the right to offer or provide capacity or bandwidth to its customers consistent with such permit, franchise, or lease; provided:
A. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall furnish the city with a copy of any such lease or agreement between the grantee, franchisee, or lessee and the customer or sub-lessee or provide to the city’s finance director sufficient information to determine whether the lessee or customer is subject to city taxes or assessments; and
B. The sub-lessee fulfills all requirements of Chapters 3.84 and 3.88 ACC regarding the reporting of all revenues subject to city taxes and assessments; and
C. Lessee must comply with the city’s registration requirements in Chapter 5.84 ACC. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

A. Comprehensive general liability insurance, written on an occurrence basis, with limits not less than:

E. The liability insurance policies required by this section shall be maintained by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee throughout the term of the public way agreement, franchise, or lease, and such other period of time during which the grantee, franchisee, or lessee is operating without a public way agreement, franchise, or lease hereunder, or is engaged in the removal of its telecommunications facilities. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall provide an insurance certificate, together with an endorsement naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, employees, representatives, engineers, consultants, and volunteers as additional insureds, to the city prior to the commencement of any work or installation of any utility or telecommunications facilities pursuant to said public way agreement, franchise, or lease. Any deductibles or self-insured retentions must be declared to and approved in writing by the city prior to the franchise becoming effective. Payment of deductibles and self-insured retentions shall be the sole responsibility of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee. The insurance certificate required by this section shall contain a clause stating that coverage shall apply separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer’s liability. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s insurance shall be primary insurance as respects the city, its officers, officials, employees, agents, consultants, and volunteers. Any insurance maintained by the city, its officers, officials, employees, consultants, agents, and volunteers shall be in excess of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s insurance and shall not contribute with it;
F. In addition to the coverage requirements set forth in this section, each such insurance policy shall contain the following endorsement:It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until 60 days after receipt by the City, by registered mail, (return receipt requested) of a written notice addressed to the City Clerk of such intent to cancel or not to renew.
G. Within 30 days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event later than 15 days prior to said cancellation or intent not to renew, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall obtain and furnish to the city replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.

20.10.230 General indemnification.
No public way agreement, franchise, or lease shall be deemed to be granted under this title unless it includes an indemnity clause substantially conforming to the following:The grantee, franchisee, or lessee hereby releases, covenants not to bring suit and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, engineers, and consultants from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person, including claims by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s own employees to which the grantee, franchisee, or lessee might otherwise be immune under RCW Title 51, arising from injury or death of any person or damage to property of which the negligent acts or omissions of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, its agents, servants, officers, or employees in performing under this Public Way Agreement, franchise, or lease are the proximate cause. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee further releases, covenants not to bring suit and agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, agents, representatives, engineers, and consultants from any and all claims, costs, judgments, awards, or liability to any person including claims by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s own employees, including those claims to which the grantee, franchisee, or lessee might otherwise have immunity under RCW Title 51, arising against the City solely by virtue of the City’s ownership or control of the rights-of-way or other public properties, by virtue of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s exercise of the rights granted herein, or by virtue of the City’s permitting the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s use of the City’s rights-of-way or other public property, based upon the City’s inspection or lack of inspection of work performed by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, its agents and servants, officers or employees in connection with work authorized on the City’s property or property over which the City has control, pursuant to this Public Way Agreement, franchise, or lease, or pursuant to any other permit or approval issued in connection with this Public Way Agreement, Franchise, or Lease. This covenant of indemnification shall include, but not be limited by this reference, claims against the City arising as a result of the negligent acts or omissions of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, its agents, servants, officers, or employees in barricading, instituting trench safety systems or providing other adequate warnings of any excavation, construction, or work in any public right-of-way or other public place in performance of work or services permitted under this Public Way Agreement, Franchise, or Lease.
Inspection or acceptance by the City of any work performed by the grantee, franchisee, or lessee at the time of completion of construction shall not be grounds for avoidance of any of these covenants of indemnification. Said indemnification obligations shall extend to claims which are not reduced to a suit and any claims which may be compromised prior to the culmination of any litigation or the institution of any litigation.
In the event that the grantee, franchisee, or lessee refuses the tender of defense in any suit or any claim, said tender having been made pursuant to the indemnification clauses contained herein, and said refusal is subsequently determined by a court having jurisdiction (or such other tribunal that the parties shall agree to decide the matter), to have been a wrongful refusal on the part of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, then the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall pay all of the City’s costs for defense of the action, including all reasonable expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees and the reasonable costs of the City, including reasonable attorneys’ fees of recovering under this indemnification clause.
In the event of liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to persons or damages to property caused by or resulting from the concurrent negligence of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee, and the City, its officers, employees and agents, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s liability hereunder shall be only to the extent of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s negligence. It is further specifically and expressly understood that the indemnification provided herein constitutes the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s waiver of immunity under RCW Title 51, solely for the purposes of this indemnification. This waiver has been mutually negotiated by the parties.
The provisions of this section shall survive the expiration or termination of any Public Way Agreement, Franchise, or Lease agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Title, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee assumes the risk of damage to its facilities located in the City’s public ways, rights-of-way, easements, and property from activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees, and contractors. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee releases and waives any and all claims against the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors for damage to or destruction of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the city, its officers, agents, employees, and contractors, in the public ways, rights-of-way, easements, or property subject to this Public Way Agreement, Franchise, or Lease, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from the sole negligence or any willful or malicious action on the part of the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors. The grantee, franchisee, or lessee further agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the City against any claims for damages, including, but not limited to, business interruption damages and lost profits, brought by or under users of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s facilities as the result of any interruption of service due to damage or destruction of the user’s facilities caused by or arising out of activities conducted by the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors, except to the extent any such damage or destruction is caused by or arises from the sole negligence or any willful or malicious actions on the part of the City, its officers, agents, employees, or contractors.

The security shall be maintained at the sole expense of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee so long as any of the grantee, franchisee, or lessee’s utility, cable or telecommunications facilities are located within the public ways of the city or upon city property and until released by the city. In the event a security involves a bank, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee is responsible for negotiating any interest that may accrue to the account during the duration of effect.

    4. That the grantee, franchisee, or lessee will be given an opportunity to review the act, default or failure described in the notice with the city or his or her designee.
C. Grantees, franchisees and lessees shall replenish the security bond or fund within 14 calendar days after written notice from the city that there is a deficiency in the amount of the bond or fund. (Ord. 5271 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5034 § 1, 1998.)

20.10.280 Assignments or transfers of public way agreements, franchises, or leases.

D. Unless otherwise provided in a public way agreement, franchise, or lease agreement, the grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall reimburse the city for all direct and indirect costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the city in considering a request to transfer or assign a public way agreement, franchise, or lease. No approval shall be deemed approved until all such costs and expenses have been paid.
E. Any transfer or assignment of a public way agreement, franchise, or lease without prior written approval of the city under this section or pursuant to a public way agreement, franchise, or lease agreement shall be void and is cause for termination of the public way agreement, franchise, or lease.

A grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall promptly notify the city in writing prior to any proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of control of a grantee’s, franchisee’s, or lessee’s company. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of a grantee’s, franchisee’s, or lessee’s company shall cause a review of the proposed transfer. In the event that the city council adopts a resolution or other appropriate order opposing such change, transfer or acquisition of control has been effected, the city may terminate the public way agreement, franchise, or lease. City approval shall not be required for mortgaging purposes or if said transfer is from a grantee, franchisee, or lessee to another person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a grantee, franchisee, or lessee.

20.10.440 Unfunded mandate.

Therefore, except as expressly provided to the contrary, all costs incurred by a grantee, franchisee, or lessee in complying with the terms and conditions of any agreement subject to this title or any applicable laws, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations and/or orders or any action thereunder shall be the sole responsibility of the respective grantee, franchisee, or lessee and shall not be the responsibility of or charged to the city.

The grantee, franchisee, or lessee shall be responsible for debris removal from such activities. If such debris is not removed within 24 hours, the city may, at its sole discretion, remove such debris and charge the grantee, franchisee, or lessee for the cost thereof.

20.14.010 Overview.
A. Service providers or any other persons or entities who seek to use the public right-of-way for small wireless facilities deployment to provide personal wireless service, data transmission, or other related services, must have a valid franchise under Chapter 20.06 ACC to use the right-of-way and a small wireless facility permit to deploy that technology at each proposed location. Entities with franchises who wish to use a small wireless facility deployment to upgrade or expand their existing services will use the processes set forth in this chapter to obtain approval of specific installations. An entity without a franchise will apply for a franchise as well as a small wireless facility permit for its initial deployment, and the applications will be processed concurrently.
B. Nothing in this chapter revises or diminishes the rights and obligations of an existing franchise.
C. Small wireless facilities deployment elements that require SEPA review may use these processes only in conjunction with SEPA review.
D. For purposes of this chapter, “small wireless facilities” are defined as facilities that meet the following conditions:
    1. The facilities:
        a. Are mounted on structures 50 feet or less in height, including their antennas as defined in 47 CFR 1.1320(d); or
        b. Are mounted on structures no more than 10 percent taller than other adjacent structures; or
        c. Do not extend existing structures on which they are located to a height of more than 50 feet or by more than 10 percent, whichever is greater; and
    2. Each antenna associated with the deployment, excluding associated antenna equipment (as defined in the definition of antenna in 47 CFR 1.1320(d)), is no more than three cubic feet in volume; and
    3. All other wireless equipment associated with the structure (including the wireless equipment associated with the antenna and any preexisting associated equipment on the structure) is no more than 28 cubic feet in volume; and
    4. The facilities do not require antenna structure registration under Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 17; and
    5. The facilities are not located on Tribal lands, as defined under 36 CFR 800.16(x); and
    6. The facilities do not result in human exposure to radio frequency radiation in excess of the applicable safety standards specified in 47 CFR 1.1307(b); and
    7. The facilities are currently located or are proposed to be located within the public right-of-way. For facilities currently located or proposed to be located on private property, please see Chapter 18.31 ACC. For facilities currently located or proposed to be located on public property or facilities, please see Chapter 20.08 ACC. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.020 Application for small wireless facilities permits.
For locations in the public right-of-way, the director of public works (“director”) is charged with administration of small wireless facilities deployments and other small wireless facilities permit review processes for use of public right-of-way established under this chapter.
Unless previously provided with an application for a franchise, the following information will be provided by all applicants seeking to use small wireless facilities deployment:
A. Specific locational information, including GPS coordinates of all proposed facilities; and
B. Specific design information and plans, addressing poles or other support structures, attachments, conduit, and any ground-mounted equipment; and
C. A narrative addressing how the proposed plans are consistent with the franchise exhibit(s), if applicable, or otherwise meet the design requirements of this chapter, and otherwise as required within the ACC; and
D. A concealment plan demonstrating how the proposed small wireless facilities comply with the city of Auburn engineering design standards; and
E. Provision of proof of Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory approvals required to provide the service(s) or use the technologies sought to be installed; and
F. Provision of proof that the proposed facilities will not interfere with the city’s automated metering infrastructure (AMI), telemetry (SCADA), automated light meter facilities, or other city communication facilities; and
G. Provision of proof from pole or structure owners that the additional load of small wireless facilities can be accommodated by the poles or structures or if the city is the pole or structure owner, proof of compliance with Chapter 20.08 ACC; and
H. Any other information determined by the director to be necessary for processing the application.
Permits issued under this chapter will not supplant any other permits required under federal or state law, or the Auburn City Code, including, but not limited to, Chapters 12.24 and 13.32A ACC. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.030 Implementation – Small wireless facilities permits.
The rights granted under a franchise are implemented through the issuance of small wireless facilities permits. The franchise application, required under Chapter 20.06 ACC, may be accompanied by one or more applications for a small wireless facilities permit to deploy small wireless facilities. An initial franchise and any related small wireless facilities permit applications will be processed concurrently.
A. Up to five sites may be specified in one small wireless facilities permit application for processing.
B. Issuance of a small wireless facilities permit to install small wireless facilities will be contingent upon approval of a franchise under Chapter 20.06 ACC, or the possession of a valid franchise.
C. Any element of a deployment that qualifies as an eligible facilities request under 47 CFR 1.40001 will be specifically designated by the applicant and may be addressed separately by the director in order to comply with the shot clocks established by federal law.
D. The director may approve, deny, or conditionally approve all or any portion of the sites proposed in a small wireless facilities permit application. Any denial of an application under this chapter must be made in writing and be supported by substantial evidence.
E. Any application for a small wireless facilities permit that contains an element that is not exempt from SEPA review will simultaneously submit a SEPA Environmental Checklist under Chapter 43.21C RCW and Chapter 16.06 ACC.
F. The city recognizes that the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the Federal Communications Commission sole jurisdiction in the field of regulation of electromagnetic radio frequency emissions and small wireless facilities that meet Federal Communications Commission standards will not be conditioned or denied on the basis of radio frequency or electromagnetic frequency impacts. Applicants for small wireless facilities will be required to provide the city information on the projected power density of the facility and compliance with the Federal Communications Commission requirements. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.040 Small wireless facility permit review process.
The following provisions relate to applications for a small wireless facility permit:
A. Federal Law. Review of the site locations proposed by the applicant will be governed by the provisions of 47 USC 253 and 47 USC 332 and applicable regulations and case law. Applicants will be treated in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner with other service providers whose facilities are similarly situated in terms of structure, placement, or cumulative impacts. Small wireless facilities permit review under this chapter will neither prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of an applicant to provide telecommunications services.
B. Concealment. The city will permit small wireless facility deployment on existing or replacement poles or structures conforming to the city’s generally applicable pole design standards, the city’s engineering design and construction standards, the concealment element plan approved as part of the small wireless facilities permit(s), and consistent with the relevant franchise exhibit (if applicable). Small wireless facilities may not be expanded unless the expansion does not defeat the facility’s required concealment elements.
C. The director will review applications for small wireless facilities permits for consistency with relevant franchise exhibits and design standards.
D. Small wireless facilities permits to install facilities will be processed within the time frames set by applicable federal regulations.
E. The decision of the director to approve a small wireless facility permit will be final and is not subject to appeal under city code or further legislative review. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.050 Deviations.
Any request for deviations from the approved small cell facilities design designated in the franchise, or any previously approved small wireless facility permit, will be considered a new small wireless facilities permit request. An applicant seeking approval of a deviation from an approved small wireless facilities permit will apply for a new small wireless facilities permit. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.060 Small wireless facility approvals and processes.
Approval of a small wireless facility permit and/or other approval referenced in this chapter are conditioned on the following requirements:
A. Satisfy applicable bulk requirements, such as noise and light regulations.
B. Comply with adopted design and concealment standards as provided by the city’s engineering design and construction standards.
C. Obtain the written approval of the owner of any pole or structure for the installation of its facilities on such pole or structure. Approval of a franchise under Chapter 20.06 ACC does not authorize attachment to city-owned poles or other structures.
D. Unless specifically provided for in a franchise, obtain a lease or other applicable authorization from the city to use city-owned poles, ground space or infrastructure for the installation of any small wireless facility, or to locate any new ground-based structure, base station, or other attendant equipment on city right-of-way.
E. Comply with all city construction standards and state and federal codes when operating in the right-of-way and obtain a required permit to enter the right-of-way for construction. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.070 Additional review procedures.
Small wireless facilities in shorelines management zones or environmentally critical areas are subject to review as provided in Chapters 16.08 and/or 16.10 ACC. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.080 Compliance with federal processing limitations.
Review of small wireless facilities permits will comply with the provisions of 47 CFR Part 1, subpart U, if applicable. Applications will be reviewed, completeness determined, and the time frame tolled as provided in this chapter and Chapter 20.06 ACC. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.090 Design standards.
All small wireless facilities will be constructed or installed according to applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), state and city regulations and standards, including the city of Auburn engineering design and construction standards. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.100 Noninterference.
Wireless facilities of any kind will not interfere with any emergency, communication, or utility infrastructure systems of the city.
A. If the city notifies service providers that their equipment is potentially interfering with public safety communications equipment, the providers will cooperate and coordinate with the city and among themselves to investigate and mitigate the interference, if any, utilizing the procedures set forth in the joint wireless industry – public safety “Best Practices Guide,” released by the FCC in February 2001, including the “Good Engineering Practices,” as may be amended or revised by the FCC from time to time.
B. If any service provider or facility owner fails to cooperate with the city in complying with the owner’s obligations under this section or if the FCC makes a determination of radio frequency interference with the city communications equipment, the owner who fails to cooperate and/or the owner of the facility or facilities which caused the interference will be responsible, upon FCC determination of radio frequency interference, for reimbursing the city for all costs associated with ascertaining and resolving the interference, including but not limited to any engineering studies obtained by the city to determine the source of the interference. For the purposes of this subsection, failure to cooperate will include failure to initiate any response or action as described in the “Best Practices Guide” within 24 hours of the city’s notification. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)

20.14.110 Facility removal.
A small wireless facility will be removed:
A. Within 180 days of the date the facility’s use is discontinued, it ceases to be operational, the permit is revoked, or, if the facility falls into disrepair and is not maintained, within 90 days of a notice from the city to effect repairs and maintenance to the satisfaction of the city. The owner and/or operator of a facility will notify the city upon the discontinued use of a particular facility; however,
B. If the owner and/or operator fails to remove the facility as required, then the facility is a nuisance and subject to appropriate legal proceeding. (Ord. 6707 § 1 (Exh. A), 2018.)
