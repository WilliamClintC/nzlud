Nothing in this subsection B shall be deemed to require substitution of the name of the municipality for the word “State” when that word is used as part of the title of the State Tax Commission, or of the Constitution of the state of Utah, nor shall the name of the municipality be substituted for that of the state in any section when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the municipality or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Tax Commission in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.

3. If an annual license has been issued to a retailer under Section 59-12-106 of the Utah Code Annotated 1953, an additional license shall not be required by reason of this section.

Residents of Roosevelt City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce.

There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the city and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of city officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by door-to-door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door-to-door solicitation, the city adopts this chapter to promote the city’s substantial interests in:

A. Respecting citizens’ decisions regarding privacy in their residences;

B. Protecting persons from criminal conduct;

C. Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious belief, political position, or charitable activities; and

D. Permitting truthful and nonmisleading door-to-door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.

Article I. Declaration of Findings and Intent—Scope of Chapter


5.48.010 Declaration of finding and intent.

A. Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way. The city of Roosevelt finds that the rights-of-way within the city:

1. Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the city;

2. Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;

3. Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of the city and its citizens; and

4. Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to the negative effects upon the public from such facilities’ construction, placement, relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way.

B. Finding Regarding Compensation. The city finds that the city should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the right-of-way.

C. Finding Regarding Local Concern. The city finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.

D. Finding Regarding Promotion of Telecommunications Services. The city finds that it is in the best interest of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscrimination basis, responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational and community services.

E. Findings Regarding Franchise Standards. The city finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:

1. Fairly and reasonably compensates the city on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis as provided herein;

2. Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;

3. Fully protects the public interests and the city from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;

4. Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of the city, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;

5. Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the city infrastructure;

6. Protects the public’s investment in improvements in the rights-of-way; and

7. Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Act”) [P.L. No. 104-104].

F. Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The city adopts this telecommunications chapter pursuant to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act. (Ord. 2001-300 § 1.1)


5.48.020 Scope of chapter.

This chapter shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of the rights-of-way, including providers of both the system and service, those providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide services. This chapter shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the city prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, whether operating with or without a franchise as set forth in Section 5.48.540. (Ord. 2001-300 § 1.2)


5.48.030 Excluded activity.

A. Cable TV. This chapter shall not apply to cable television operators otherwise regulated by a franchise agreement.

B. Wireless Services. This chapter shall not apply to personal wireless service facilities.

C. Provisions Applicable to Excluded Providers. Providers excused by other law that prohibits the city from requiring a franchise shall not be required to obtain a franchise, but all of the requirements imposed by this chapter through the exercise of the city’s police power and not preempted by other law shall be applicable. (Ord. 2001-300 § 1.3)

Title VI, Part V), regardless of the system used.

“Open video system” means the system of cables, wires, lines, towers, wave guides, optic fiber, microwave, laser beams, and any associated converters, equipment, or facilities designed and constructed for the purpose of producing, receiving, amplifying or distributing open video services to or from subscribers or locations within the city.

Article III. Franchise Required


5.48.050 Nonexclusive franchise.

The city is empowered and authorized to issue nonexclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and maintenance of systems in the city’s rights-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the city and provider. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.1)


5.48.060 Every provider must obtain.

Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to construction of a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the right-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before construction of an open video system or providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies to the extent the city is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.2)


5.48.070 Nature of grant.

A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-way on a nonexclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others, including the city’s property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.3)


5.48.080 Current providers.

Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall request issuance of a franchise from the city within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. If such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.48.460. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.4)


5.48.090 Nature of franchise.

The franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be a nonexclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove and replace its system on, over and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.5)


5.48.100 Regulatory approval needed.

Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approval, permits, authorizations or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the city upon the written request of the city evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations or licenses. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.6)


5.48.110 Term.

No franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall have a term of less than five years or greater than fifteen (15) years. Each franchise shall be granted in a nondiscriminatory manner. (Ord. 2001-300 § 3.7)

Article IV. Compensation and Other Payments


5.48.120 Compensation.

As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, a provider shall have the following obligations:

A. Application Fee. In order to offset the cost to the city to review an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits or charges, a provider shall pay to the city, at the time of application, a nonrefundable application fee, the amount of which will be set by resolution of the city council.

B. Franchise Fee. The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or business license tax enacted by the city.

C. Excavation Permits. The provider shall also pay a bond of five hundred dollars ($500.00) required for an excavation permit before digging in any city right-of-way. This bond is refundable once the right-of-way is restored after excavating, to the satisfaction of the city’s director of public works. (Ord. 2016-401 (part); Ord. 2001-300 § 4.1)


5.48.130 Timing.

Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within forty-five (45) days of the close of each calendar month. (Ord. 2001-300 § 4.2)


5.48.140 Fee statement and certification.

Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its accuracy. (Ord. 2001-300 § 4.3)


5.48.150 Future costs.

A provider shall pay to the city or to third parties, at the direction of the city, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable expenses that the city incurs for the services of third parties (including but not limited to attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this chapter or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. (Ord. 2001-300 § 4.4)


5.48.160 Taxes and assessments.

To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities, other than the city on the use of the city property as a result of a provider’s use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 2001-300 § 4.5)


5.48.170 Interest on late payments.

In the event that any payment is not actually received by the city on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes. (Ord. 2001-300 § 4.6)


5.48.180 No accord and satisfaction.

No acceptance by the city of any fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable. (Ord. 2001-300 § 4.7)


5.48.190 Not in lieu of other taxes or fees.

The fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment except as specifically provided in this chapter, or as required by applicable law.

To activate water service without proper application and permission from the city shall constitute a theft of services pursuant to Utah Code Section 76-6-409 and shall be punishable as a misdemeanor or felony depending upon the amount involved. To use an existing connection to supply water to a residence, dwelling, trailer, or any other structure not attached to or considered a part of the structure for which a connection has been obtained, also constitutes a theft of services and shall be punishable as a misdemeanor or felony, depending upon the amount and shall result in the loss of water service to the structure from which the water is being used. Also, if a water subscriber is guilty of this, he shall be required to pay a one hundred dollar ($100.00) penalty before applying for water under the provisions of this article.

In all such cases, a failure on the part of any one of the users to comply with this section shall warrant a withholding of a supply of water through the service connections until compliance or payment has been made, and in any event, the property owner shall be primarily liable to the municipality for all water services utilized on all such premises. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the power of the municipality to require separate pipes, connections or meters at a subsequent time. (Prior code § 14-123)

All residential lots and all business or commercial lots that water outside must pay the appropriate connection fee within ninety (90) days of being billed. The connection fee shall be set by resolution.

All residential lot owners are responsible to pay the monthly service fee based upon the rate schedule set by resolution. Failure to pay the monthly service fee for the secondary water within the same time limit requirement for culinary water shall result in penalties and interest in a like manner as the culinary water. Both culinary and secondary water service can be terminated to any residential lot and commercial lot for nonpayment according to ordinance and policy as constituted by the city of Roosevelt. (Ord. 2009-358 § 4)1

5. Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement to such degree that any such material received in the composite sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the building inspector for such materials;

6. Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be established by the building inspector as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;

7. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the building inspector in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;

8. Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 8.5;

9. Materials which exert or cause:

a. Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers Earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate),

b. Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes, and vegetable tanning solutions),

c. Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works,

d. Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting “slugs” as defined in this chapter;

10. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment process employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.

E. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection D of this section, and which in the judgment of the building inspector, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the building inspector may:

1. Reject the wastes;

2. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;

3. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

4. Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of subsection J of this section.

If the building inspector permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the building inspector, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.

F. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the building inspector, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the building inspector, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.

G. Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.

H. When required by the building inspector, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the building inspector. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.

I. All measurements, tests and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,” published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is constructed. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazard to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples.)

J. No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern. (Prior code § 14-224)

A. All required notices have been given and made and public hearings conducted as requested by the Impact Fees Act with respect to the IFFP, the IFA, and this impact fee ordinance (this âchapterâ).

B. Growth and development activities in the city will create additional demands on its infrastructure. The facility improvement requirements that are analyzed in the IFFP and the IFA are the direct result of the additional facility needs caused by future development activities. The persons responsible for growth and development activities should pay a proportionate share of the costs of the facilities needed to serve the growth and development activity.

C. Impact fees are necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in comparison with the benefits already received and yet to be received.

D. In enacting and approving the IFA including the impact fees recommended and this chapter, the council has taken into consideration, and may consider on a case-by-case basis in the future, the future capital facilities and needs of the city, the capital financial needs of the city that are the result of the cityâs future facilities needs, the distribution of the burden of costs to different properties within the city based on the use of sanitary sewer of the city by such properties, the financial contribution of those properties and other properties similarly situated in the city at the time of computation of the required fee and prior to the enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter, all revenue sources available to the city, and the impact on future facilities that will be required by growth and new development activities in the city.

E. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purpose and intent of the council in establishing the impact fee program. (Ord. 2017-414 Â§ 1)


13.14.020 Definitions.

A. Except as provided below, words and phrases that are defined in the Impact Fees Act shall have the same meaning in this chapter.

B. âService areaâ shall mean that geographic area designated within the cityâs boundaries as exhibited in the appendix of the IFFP and IFA.

C. âProject improvementâ does not mean system improvement and includes, but is not limited to, those projects identified in the plans for the benefit of growth.

D. âUtah State Impact Fees Actâ shall mean Title 11, Chapter 36a, Utah Code Annotated 1953 or its successor state statute if that title and chapter is renumbered, recodified, or amended. (Ord. 2017-414 Â§ 2)


13.14.030 Adoption.

The council hereby approves and adopts the IFA including the recommended impact fees attached and the analyses reflected therein. The IFFP and the IFA are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as though fully set forth herein. (Ord. 2017-414 Â§ 3)


13.14.040 Impact fee calculations.

A. Impact Fees. The impact fees imposed by this chapter shall have one component: a future facilities impact fee. The impact fee shall be calculated as set forth below.

B. Developer Credits/Developer Reimbursements. A developer, including a school district or charter school, may be allowed to receive a credit against or proportionate reimbursement of impact fees if the developer dedicates land for a system improvement, builds and dedicates some or all of a system improvement, or dedicates a public facility that the city and the developer agree will reduce the need for a system improvement. A credit against impact fees shall be granted for any dedication of land for, improvement to, or new construction of, any system improvements provided by the developer if the facilities are system improvements to the respective utilities, or are dedicated to the public and offset the need for an identified future improvement.

C. Adjustment of Fees. The council may adjust either up (but not above the maximum allowable fee) or down the standard impact fees at the time the fee is charged in order to respond to an unusual circumstance in specific cases and to ensure that the fees are imposed fairly. The council may adjust the amount of the fees to be imposed if the fee payer submits studies and data clearly showing that the payment of an adjusted impact fee is more consistent with the true impact being placed on the system.

D. Impact Fee Accounting. The city shall establish a separate interest-bearing ledger account for the cash impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter. Interest earned on such account shall be allocated to that account.

1. Reporting. At the end of each fiscal year, the city shall prepare a report generally showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned and received by the fund or account and of each expenditure from the fund or account. The report shall also identify impact fee funds by the year in which they were received, the project from which the funds were collected, the capital projects from which the funds were budgeted, and the projected schedule for expenditure and be provided to the State Auditor on the appropriate form found on the State Auditorâs website.

2. Impact Fee Expenditures. Funds collected pursuant to the impact fees shall be deposited in such account and only be used by the city to construct and upgrade the respective facilities to adequately service development activity or used as otherwise approved by law.

E. Refunds. The city shall refund any impact fee paid when:

1. The fee payer has not proceeded with the development activity and has filed a written request with the council for a refund within one year after the impact fee was paid;

2. The fees have not been spent or encumbered within six years of the payment date; and

3. No impact has resulted. (Ord. 2017-414 Â§ 4)


13.14.050 Appeal.

A. Any person required to pay an impact fee who believes the fee does not meet the requirements of the law may file a written request for information with the council.

B. Within two weeks of the receipt of the request for information the city shall provide the person or entity with a copy of the reports and with any other relevant information relating to the impact fee.

C. Any person or entity required to pay an impact fee imposed under this chapter, who believes the fee does not meet the requirements of law may request and be granted a full administrative appeal of that grievance. An appeal shall be made to the council within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the action complained of, or the date when the complaining person reasonably should have become aware of the action.

Chapter 13.16 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER DISPOSAL CHARGES

Sections:

13.16.010    Industrial recovery charge.

13.16.020    Purpose.

13.16.030    Factors in determining charge.

13.16.040    Power and authority of city council.

13.16.050    Dates of implementation.

13.16.060    Fees—Rules and regulations.


13.16.010 Industrial recovery charge.

In conformity with the rules and regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States Government as set forth in the EPA Step III Grant Conditions for the construction of the new Roosevelt City wastewater disposal facilities, there is created and established an industrial recovery charge to be assessed upon industrial users of the Roosevelt City wastewater disposal treatment facilities as set forth in this chapter. (Prior code § 9-611)


13.16.020 Purpose.

The intent and purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the proper amount of federal funds are recovered from industrial users of the Roosevelt City wastewater treatment facilities and to ensure that each industry using said facility for the discharge of process water therein, is required to pay its fair and equitable portion of industrial cost recovery funds. (Prior code § 9-612)


13.16.030 Factors in determining charge.

The Roosevelt City council is authorized and empowered to fix an appropriate industrial cost recovery charge and to assess the same against industrial users of the Roosevelt City wastewater disposal facilities. Said charges shall be based upon the industrial wastewater characteristics which influence the cost of the construction of the Roosevelt City wastewater treatment works. Such characteristics shall include BOD strength, total suspended solids strength, and volume of flow from each industrial user of the facility. Additionally, the Roosevelt City council shall take into consideration relative to the fixing of said charge the following factors:

A. If an industrial user’s maximum flow (hourly, daily, monthly, seasonally, etc.) contributes to the cost of construction of the treatment works, such factor should be the basis for determining the amount of the industrial cost recovery charge. No credit shall be given to the industrial user for that time period when the user is not operating and not discharging wastewater into the treatment facility. All cooling water discharged by an industrial user into the treatment facility shall be considered process waste and must be included in the factors used to determine the industrial cost recovery charge.

B. The cost of constructing any unreserved excess capacity into the Roosevelt City wastewater disposal system need not be recovered from existing industrial users and therefore need not be considered among the factors used to determine the industrial cost recovery charge.

C. All industrial cost recovery charges shall be based on so-called Step III construction and administrative costs of the Roosevelt City wastewater disposal system, plus all re-laced Step I and Step II costs involved in said project. All Step I or Step II grant costs which do not result in actual Step III construction costs are not allocable to individual industrial users, and consequently need not be recovered.

D. All industrial users discharging pretreated process wastes into the Roosevelt City wastewater treatment facilities must pay industrial cost recovery based on the characteristics of the pretreated process wastes. (Prior code § 9-613)


13.16.040 Power and authority of city council.

The regulatory and administrative power and authority given to the Roosevelt City council, acting through appropriate resolutions, shall include but not be limited to the following areas:

A. Regulations permitting industrial users to reserve capacity in the treatment works (including used and unused capacity). Such capacity formally reserved through written agreement, is subject to industrial cost recovery charges;

B. Regulations affecting the amount of the industrial cost recovery charges assessed against industrial users in the event of expansion of the wastewater treatment facilities in the future with federal grant assistance;

C. Regulations relating to the imposition of an industrial cost recovery charge against a new industry. As used herein the term “new industry” means an industry which connects to the Roosevelt City treatment works after such treatment works have been put into service;

D. Regulations respecting the effect upon the industrial cost recovery charges, in the event an industrial user discontinues to use the treatment works;

E. Regulations relating to the fulfillment of an industry’s cost recovery obligation through lump sum payments;

F. Regulations excluding certain grant costs from industrial cost recovery computations and excluding certain industries from the application of the industrial cost recovery system and charges;

G. Regulations involving the manner and time for the assessment of industrial cost recovery charges and the manner of payment of the same;

H. Regulations covering the retention of industrial cost recovery funds, including the manner of repayment of said funds to the federal government, and regulations respecting uncollected industrial cost recovery charges which mature into bad debts, and the effect of such bad debts upon other industrial users;

I. Regulations respecting the monitoring of the industrial cost recovery system for the purpose of determining the wastewater characteristics used in fixing the industrial cost recovery charge upon each industrial user;

J. Regulations involving the preparation and maintenance of records as evidence of compliance by Roosevelt City with EPA grant requirements. (Prior code § 9-614)


13.16.050 Dates of implementation.

The provisions of this chapter together with the rules and regulations adopted by the city council through resolution, respecting the imposition and collection of industrial cost recovery charges, shall be implemented as of the date of beneficial use by the first industrial user at the time any element of the treatment works funded by the applicable construction grant becomes operable and shall terminate at the conclusion of the useful life of the Roosevelt City wastewater disposal project estimated to be July 1, 1997 unless federal grant funds are again used to expand or improve the present facilities in which event this chapter, together with any resolutions adopted pursuant hereto, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof. (Prior code § 9-615)


13.16.060 Fees—Rules and regulations.

A. The city council of the city is authorized to adopt and amend a system of user charges to cover all costs related to the collection and treatment of Roosevelt City’s wastewater.

B. The wastewater user system and charges may be adopted by said city council by resolution without the need of publication.

C. The city council by resolution shall have authority to provide such regulations and penalties for the administration and enforcement of said user charges as it shall deem appropriate. (Prior code § 9-616)

Upon payment of the applicable fee, a certificate will be issued showing ownership of the connection(s). Unless changed by city council, there is no limit to the number of connections a person may purchase.

2. In-city water and sewer connections can only be purchased at the Roosevelt City Building front office during regularly scheduled working hours.

B. Out-of-City Purchasing Policy.

1. Any person may purchase an out-of-city water or sewer connection for the applicable fee in effect by current ordinance, but first must personally appear before the city council at a regularly scheduled city council meeting to make a formal request for the connection(s) and to answer any questions the council may have. The council must, by motion, give the out-of-city applicant permission to proceed with purchase before a certificate will be issued.

2. After receiving council approval, an out-of-city water and/or sewer connection can only be purchased at the Roosevelt City Building front office during regularly scheduled working hours. (Ord. 89-231 § 1)


13.20.020 Water and sewer connection transferring policy.

A. This policy applies to both in-city and out-of-city water and sewer connections. An individual who purchases, inherits, or otherwise legally acquires a Roosevelt City water and sewer connection may or may not apply it to a certain lot or parcel of land. If the connection has not been made, it can be transferred to any other lot or parcel the owner so desires, as long as the new site can be serviced by the city. Upon making the water or sewer connection, the said connection is considered executed and cannot be transferred or used again. It must remain with the property it was executed on and is considered used. The certificate of ownership issued with the connection will be surrendered at the time service is applied for. The certificate will be surrendered to the city treasurer.

B. The owner of the Roosevelt City water or sewer certificate may sell, give or otherwise transfer the certificate to anyone whom the owner so desires. In order to accomplish this, the certificate holder must endorse the certificate, in the proper place on the back of the certificate, to the new owner at which time the new owner presents the certificate to the city treasurer. The city treasurer will check the certificate to ensure proper order and shall, upon verification of order, retire the transferred certificate back into the certificate book and issue a new certificate to the new owner. (Ord. 89-231 § 2)


13.20.030 Ownership.

A. After March 31, 1989, a water and/or sewer certificate issued by the city treasurer and signed by the mayor, will constitute ownership of both in-city and out-of-city connections.

B. After March 31, 1989, no other means will be used to determine if someone legitimately owns a water and/or sewer connection in-city or out-of-city, other than an official certificate issued by the treasurer and signed by the mayor, except as follows:

Indisputable proof of the claim must be produced. The burden of proof is clearly upon the individual claiming the connection(s) and the Roosevelt City personnel will no longer spend time in an attempt to research such claims. (Ord. 89-231 § 3)


13.20.040 Executing a sewer or water connection.

A. In-City Execution of a Connection.

1. A person holding a water or sewer connection certificate may present the certificate to the city treasurer and apply for the connection. At this time, the treasurer will determine that the connection can be made and serviced for the desired location by contacting the public works director. If there are no problems with the location of the request, the treasurer shall take possession of the signed certificate and present an application to the one desiring the water and/or sewer service.

Upon successful completion of the application, the connection will be made.

2. At no time will the city honor a connection certificate for an area that cannot be serviced by Roosevelt City pursuant to the water and sewer ordinances.

B. Out-of-City Execution of a Connection.

1. A person holding an out-of-city water or sewer connection certificate must appear before the city council and obtain permission from the council before retiring the certificate and applying for the connection.

2. The certificate will be honored after it is determined that the city can reasonably render the service pursuant to the applicable water and/or sewer ordinance.

C. After a connection is executed, it is considered used and will remain with the property it was used on and cannot be transferred thereafter. If the building or structure for which the connection was made to be serviced is eliminated, the connection must still remain with that property and may be used in a subsequent structure. (Ord. 89-231 § 4)


13.20.050 Recording the ownership of water and/or sewer connection.

A. It is the responsibility of the city treasurer to issue ownership certificates for sewer and water connections and to record the same.

B. It is the responsibility of any person believing they own a water and sewer connection to provide proof of such ownership and to file for the ownership certificate through the city treasurer prior to March 21, 1989, as directed in the public notice published on February 14, 21 and 28 of 1989.

C. Any certificate of ownership that is transferred must be redeemed at the city office of the treasurer so that the transferred certificate(s) may be recorded and retired and a new certificate issued. (Ord. 89-231 § 5)

13.28.060 Definitions.

“Approved backflow assembly” means an assembly accepted by the Utah State Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Drinking Water, as meeting the applicable specifications or as suitable for the proposed use.

Auxiliary Water Supply. Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor’s public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor’s public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, etc., or “used waters” or “industrial fluids.” These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have authority for sanitary control.

“Backflow” means the reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either back-pressure or back-siphonage.

“Backflow prevention assembly” means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. Specifications for backflow prevention assemblies are contained within the plumbing code as adopted by the state of Utah and in the cross-connection control program for Utah maintained by the Division of Drinking Water.

“Back-pressure” means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances from a region of high pressure to a region of lower pressure into the water distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source(s) other than the intended source.

“Back-siphonage” means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under vacuum conditions into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source(s) other than the intended source, caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable water system.

“Contamination” means a degradation of the quality of the potable water supply by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials that may create a health hazard.

“Cross-connection” means any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures which may allow nonpotable water or industrial fluids or other material of questionable quality to come into contact with potable water inside a water distribution system. This would include temporary conditions such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices or sliding multi-port tubes or other plumbing arrangements.

“Cross-connection, containment” means the installation of an approved backflow assembly at the water service connection to any customer’s premises where it is physically and economically not feasible to find, permanently eliminate, or control all, actual, or potential cross-connections within the customer’s water distribution system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer’s water distribution system; or, it shall mean the installation of a portion of a customer’s water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection (isolation).

“Cross-connection, controlled” means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard.

“Water purveyor” means the person designated to be in charge of the water department of Roosevelt City, is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2011-371 § 2)


13.28.070 Requirements.

A. Policy.

1. No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws, regulations, codes, and this chapter and shall be discontinued by the water purveyor after due process of written notifications of violation and an appropriate time suspense for voluntary compliance, if:

a. A backflow prevention assembly required by this chapter for the control of backflow and cross-connections is not installed, tested, and maintained; or

b. If it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or bypassed; or

c. If an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises; or

d. If the periodic system survey has not been conducted.

e. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.

2. The customer’s system(s) shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representative of the water purveyor to determine whether cross-connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violation of this chapter, exist and to audit the results of the required survey (Section 309.104.12 of the Utah Administrative Code).

3. Whenever the public water purveyor deems a service connection’s water usage constitutes a sufficient hazard to the water supply, an approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line of the identified consumer’s water system, at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line.

4. The type of protective assembly required under subsection (A)(3) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists at the point of cross-connection (whether direct or indirect) applicable to local and state requirements or resulting from the required survey.

5. All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies which do not meet the requirements of this section, but were approved assemblies for the purposes described herein at the time of installation and which have been property maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (A)(6) of this section, be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water purveyor is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the public water system. Whenever the existing is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or, when the water purveyor finds that the operation of this assembly constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting all local and state requirements.

6. It shall be the responsibility of the consumer at any premises where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified surveys/inspections and operation tests made at least once per year at the consumer’s expense. In those instances where the public water purveyor deems the hazard to be great, he may require certified surveys/inspections and tests at a more frequent interval. It shall be the duty of the purveyor to see that the tests are made according to the standards set forth by the Utah State Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Drinking Water.

7. All backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested within ten (10) working days of installation.

8. No backflow assemblies shall be installed so as to create a safety hazard. (Example: installed over an electrical panel, steam pipes, boilers, or above ceiling level.) (Ord. 2011-371 § 3.1)


13.28.080 Violation of this policy.

 If violation of this chapter exists and there has not been any corrective action taken by the consumer within ten (10) days of the written notification of the deficiencies noted within the survey or test results, then the water purveyor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition(s) in accordance with all state and local regulations and statutes relating to plumbing, safe drinking water suppliers, and this chapter.

A. A city appointed appeal authority may grant a variance if:

17.03.210 Constitutional takings.

To promote the protection of private property rights and to prevent the physical taking or exaction of private property without just compensation, the city council and all commissions, boards, appointees and designees shall adhere to the following before authorizing the seizure or exaction of property:

A. Takings Review Procedure. Prior to any proposed action to exact or seize property, the city attorney shall review the proposed action to determine if a constitutional taking requiring “just compensation” would occur. The city attorney shall review all such matters pursuant to the guidelines established in subsection B of this section. Upon identifying a possible constitutional taking, the city attorney shall, in confidential writing, protected by attorney client relationship, inform the council, commission or board of the possible consequences of its actions. This opinion shall be advisory only. No liability shall be attributed to the city for failure to follow the recommendation of the city attorney.

B. Takings Guidelines. The city attorney shall review whether the action constitutes a constitutional taking under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, or under the Utah Constitution. The city attorney shall determine whether the proposed action bears an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest and whether the action is roughly proportionate and reasonably related to the legitimate governmental interest. The city attorney shall also determine whether the action deprives the private property owner of all reasonable use of the property. These guidelines are advisory only and shall not expand or limit the scope of the city’s liability for a constitutional taking.

C. Appeal. Any owner of private property who believes that his/her property is proposed to be “taken” by an otherwise final action of the city may appeal the city’s decision to the takings appeal board within fourteen (14) days after the decision is made. The appeal must be filed in writing with the city recorder. The takings appeal board shall hear and approve and remand or reject the appeal within fourteen (14) calendar days after the appeal is filed. The takings appeal board, with advice from the city attorney, shall review the appeal pursuant to the guidelines in subsection B of this section. The decision of the takings appeal board shall be in writing and a copy given to the appellant and to the city council, commission or board that took the initial action. The takings appeal board’s rejection of an appeal constitutes exhaustion of administrative remedies, rendering the matter suitable for appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction.

D. Takings Appeal Board. There is hereby created a three-member takings appeal board. The mayor shall appoint three members of the appeal authority to serve on the takings appeal board. If, at any time, three members of the appeal authority cannot meet to satisfy the time requirements stated in subsection C of this section, the mayor shall appoint a member or sufficient members to fill the vacancies.

Prior legislation: Ord. 79-101 § 4.


17.05.010 Purpose.

This chapter regulates the continued existence of nonconforming uses and noncomplying structures as defined in Chapter 17.01. While nonconforming uses, noncomplying structures and improvements may continue, this chapter is intended to limit enlargement, alteration, restoration, or replacement which would increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the development standards prescribed by this code. In addition, applications are reviewed to ensure that they are reducing the degree of nonconformity and improving the physical appearance of the structure and site through such measures as landscaping, building design, or the improved function of the use in relation to other uses. (Ord. 2018-421 (part): Ord. 2011-366 § 1 (part))


17.05.020 Determination of nonconforming status.

A. The owner bears the burden of establishing that any nonconforming use or noncomplying structure lawfully exists.

B. The planning and zoning board shall determine the nonconforming or noncomplying status of properties. Any decision of the administrator may be appealed within ten (10) calendar days of the decision to a city appointed appeal authority. Upon appeal, the appeal authority shall conduct a hearing and shall review the matter under de novo standard of review. (Ord. 2018-421 (part): Ord. 2011-366 § 1 (part))


17.05.030 Authority to continue.

A. A lawful nonconforming use may continue subject to the standards and limitations of this chapter.

B. A noncomplying structure that was lawfully constructed with a permit prior to a contrary change in this code may be used and maintained, subject to the standards and limitations of this chapter. (Ord. 2018-421 (part): Ord. 2011-366 § 1 (part))


17.05.040 Abandonment, loss of nonconforming use.

A. A nonconforming use that is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months is presumed abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use of the building, structure, or land must conform to the regulations for the zone in which it is located.

B. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon showing that:

1. Any period of discontinued use was caused by governmental actions or an act of God without any contributing fault by the owner, and the owner did not intend to discontinue the use; or

2. The owner can demonstrate no abandonment of the use. (Ord. 2018-421 (part): Ord. 2011-366 § 1 (part))


17.05.050 Moving, enlarging or altering nonconforming uses.

No nonconforming use may be moved, enlarged, altered or occupy additional land, except as provided in this chapter.

A. A nonconforming use may not be enlarged, expanded, or extended to occupy all or part of another structure or site that it did not occupy on the date on which the use became nonconforming. A nonconforming use may be extended through the same structure provided no structural alteration of the structure is proposed or made for the purpose of the extension, and the parking demand is not increased.

B. Exterior or interior remodeling or improvements to a structure containing a nonconforming use shall be allowed, provided there is no expansion of the area of the nonconforming use.

C. A structure containing a nonconforming use may not be moved unless the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zone into which the structure is moved.

D. Whenever any nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, such use shall not later be changed back to a nonconforming use.

1. Application for any nonconforming use must be made upon forms provided by the city recorder. Upon filing of a complete application, the city shall post the property indicating that an application for modification of a nonconforming use has been filed and that more detailed information may be obtained from the city.

2. Notice shall be provided pursuant to Utah State law as amended.

3. Within thirty (30) working days of the receipt of a complete application, and after giving proper notice, the planning and zoning board shall hold a public meeting on the nonconforming use application. The board shall either grant the application in whole or in part, with or without modifications or conditions, or deny the application. The board’s decision shall be made pursuant to criteria provided below.

4. The planning and zoning board shall approve an application to change a nonconforming use to another nonconforming use if the applicant proves the following criteria:

a. All reasonable measures will be undertaken to alleviate or reduce the incompatibility or adverse effects of the nonconforming use or building upon abutting properties or in the neighborhood; and

b. All changes, additions, or expansions comply with all current laws except as to use; and

c. The new use, if applicable, will provide for enclosed storage of necessary equipment, materials, and refuse, rather than create a need for additional outside storage; and

d. The new use does not increase the parking requirement; or if there is an increase, the site plan meets the parking requirement and the planning and zoning board finds that adjoining properties and the neighborhood will not be adversely impacted by the increased parking demand. (Ord. 2018-421 (part): Ord. 2011-366 § 1 (part))


17.05.070 Normal repair and maintenance, safety.

The owner may complete normal maintenance and incidental repair on a complying structure that contains a nonconforming use or on a noncomplying structure. This chapter shall not be construed to authorize any violations of law nor to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of the building official who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition. (Ord. 2018-421 (part): Ord. 2011-366 § 1 (part))


17.05.080 Appeals.

Appeal from a planning and zoning board decision made pursuant to this chapter shall be made to a city appointed appeals authority. Any person filing an appeal for review of any decision made under the terms of this chapter shall file such appeal within fourteen (14) days after the date of the planning and zoning board’s final decision.

17.21.080 Signs.

A. Clearance. For freestanding and projecting signs attached to a building, there shall be a minimum of ten and one-half (10.5) feet between the ground or sidewalk and any part of projecting sign. Public necessity signs and monument signs (signs which are permanently anchored, freestanding and no more than five feet in height) may be exempt from this requirement.

B. Lighting Requirements. No lighting shall be installed which will permit direct rays of such light to penetrate onto any adjoining property used for residential purposes in such a way as could constitute a nuisance.

C. Location of Signs.

2. No part of any sign shall be permitted to extend across any property line.

D. Height of Sign. The maximum sign height shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.

Attached or painted signs using more than twenty-five (25) percent of a wall or fifty (50) percent of a window area shall be considered a conditional use, and as such, shall require the approval of the planning and zoning commission prior to installation of the sign.

3. Both freestanding and attached flat signs may be utilized by a business; provided, that each sign type conforms to the above limitations. In determining the sign area, the blocked area of the sign, including the area between letters, shall be counted as part of the sign area.

F. Temporary Signs. Temporary advertising signs in industrial zones may be permitted by the building inspector for up to thirty (30) days’ use; provided, that such sign is not placed in a public right-of-way and will not create a safety hazard to the public.

2. Signs shall be neatly painted so as to look professional and be conducive to the surrounding area.

H. Sign Removal. If a sign does not conform with the requirements of this chapter, or if the construction, design, manner of use, or method of anchoring or supporting any sign makes such sign unsafe, the city building official shall proceed in any manner he deems necessary to cause the removal of the sign or the rebuilding of the sign to conform with the requirements of this chapter and the International Building Code.

I. Permits Required. Regardless of cost, no sign shall be erected or placed with Roosevelt City without first making application for and obtaining a building permit therefor, except temporary window and political posters, temporary signs pertaining to the sale of adjacent property, and nameplates or identification signs indicating the existence of an approved home occupation or professional office. In addition to the requirements of this chapter, all billboard signs designed to be read or comprehended from U.S. Highway 40 or 121 shall comply with the regulations for such signs established by the state of Utah.

D. Walls and Fences.

1. Any area outside of a building used for any business activity other than off-street parking and loading adjacent to any residential district shall be completely enclosed within a solid fence or wall of a height sufficient to completely screen such activity from the street or from adjoining parcels.
