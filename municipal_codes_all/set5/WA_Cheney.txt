PREFACE 
    The Cheney Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1963, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 21, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table-Ordinances." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. X-55, passed December 11, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. No. 272, § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 21, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 21, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 21 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 21, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 21, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

The determination of indigency shall be made by the municipal court. The office of public defender is not created in limitation of that function but to make available to the court one or more qualified persons where the right to counsel attaches to the defense of a criminal case. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. W-54, § 1, 12-9-2014) 
2.33.020 - Qualifications. 
    Any person appointed to serve as public defender shall be an attorney duly licensed to practice law in the State of Washington. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. W-54, § 2, 12-9-2014) 
2.33.030 - Selection-Term. 
    The mayor shall appoint one or more persons to serve as public defender. The municipal court upon, request of the mayor, shall provide names of qualified attorneys that the court reasonably believes have the skill and experience to provide legal counsel for indigent criminal defendants. The terms and consideration for the public defender services shall be established through written contract approved by the city council ("Contract Public Defender"). Where necessary and appropriate the municipal judge shall appoint a qualified attorney on a case by case basis. The words "necessary and appropriate" for the purposes of this section means the contract public defender is not available to provide legal representation or a conflict of interest exists such that separate legal counsel must be appointed in order to protect the interests of the indigent criminal defendant. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. W-54, § 3, 12-9-2014) 
2.33.040 - Compensation for conflict public defender. 
    A person appointed by the municipal court to serve as conflict public defender shall not be paid more than $250.00 per case plus reimbursement of costs pursuant to RCW 10.101.030. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. T-86, § 1, 2005; Ord. No. W-54, § 4, 12-9-2014) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. W-54, § 4, adopted Dec. 9, 2014, amended § 2.33.040 and, in so doing, changed the title of said section from "Compensation" to "Compensation for conflict public defender," as set out herein. 
2.33.050 - Duties and standards. 
    The public defender shall exercise that degree of skill and knowledge required of other attorneys providing similar services and shall devote reasonable time and effort to the defense of the indigent defendant. To comply with RCW 10.101.030 as well as the Superior Court Criminal Rules (CrR) 3.1 and Limited Jurisdiction Court Criminal Rules (CrRLJ) 3.1 as amended, the public defender's misdemeanor case load standards shall not exceed the representation of indigent criminal defendants in 400 cases for any calendar year (Alternative 1) or 300 cases per year as determined through a case weighting policy (Alternative 2). A "case" is defined at CrRLJ 3.3. A criminal case includes all filed charges arising out of the same incident. 
Alternative 1 : The case load of the public defender shall not exceed 400 misdemeanor cases per attorney per calendar year. The case count for the public defender who also engages in the private practice of law shall be adjusted to reflect the relative percentage of criminal defense cases in relation to the attorney's total practice of law. For example, an attorney whose practice consists of 50 percent of indigent defense services provided to the city, may not exceed 200 misdemeanor cases per calendar year. 
Alternative 2 : The case load of the public defender shall not exceed 300 misdemeanor cases per attorney per year as determined under a case-weighting policy. The city hereby adopts the Model Public Defense Case Weighting Policy for misdemeanors as adopted by the Washington State Office of Public Defense ("OPD Case Weighting Policy"), except as modified herein or by local practice. The clerk of the Cheney Municipal Court shall maintain a copy of the OPD Case Weighting Policy, as modified by the city. Case credits for the purpose of case weighting shall be determined in accordance with the OPD Case Weighting Policy, as modified herein. 
    The public defender will not receive a case credit when: the court dismisses a case on the motion of the prosecuting attorney before legal representation has been assigned; the public defender services have been limited to explaining to the defendant the implication of the city prosecutor reducing a criminal matter to a civil infraction, dismissal prior to first appearance of arraignment; a conflict of interest exists and the public defender voluntarily withdraws from the representation; or in the reasonable judgment of the public defender circumstances arose that eliminated the need to expend time and resources to resolve the case. 
    The city recognizes that certain types of misdemeanor cases require a limited amount of time and effort to ensure effective representation. Where a case satisfies a certain set of requirements, the municipal court has adopted administrative procedures and policies to expeditiously resolve those misdemeanors through stipulations and civil compromises that do not result in a criminal conviction. Such cases can include resolution through diversion, reduction to an infraction, stipulated order of continuance or other order that does not involve a finding of guilt. In addition to the above, a sentence violation, other non-charge representation or a matter where the public defender does not need to appear on behalf of the defendant, such cases shall be accounted for at less than one-third ( 1/3 ) full case credit. 
    Annually, the mayor, municipal court, and public defender shall agree upon whether the case counting method will be based upon the total number of misdemeanor cases in a year assigned to the public defender or a numerical case weighting system as described in the OPD Case Weighting Model Policy. Such determination shall be reflected in writing between the mayor, municipal court, and public defender. 
    The public defender shall comply with the requirement set forth in CrRLJ 3.1 and file a signed certification of compliance on a quarterly basis with the municipal court on the form set forth in the criminal court rules of the State of Washington. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. W-54, § 5, 12-9-2014) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. W-54, § 5, adopted Dec. 9, 2014, amended § 2.33.050 and, in so doing, changed the title of said section from "Duties" to "Duties and standards," as set out herein. 
2.33.060 - Independent judgment. 
    The public defender shall exercise independent judgment when providing criminal defense services to ensure effective legal representation. The public defender's conduct shall conform to the rules of professional conduct, case law and standards of the Washington State Bar Association. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. W-54, § 6, 12-9-2014) 
2.33.070 - Representation limited to municipal court. 
    Unless otherwise required by law the public defender's representation of a criminal defendant shall be limited to the municipal court. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998; Ord. No. W-54, § 7, 12-9-2014) 
2.33.080 - Other employment not prohibited. 
    A person appointed by the mayor to serve as public defender shall not solely by reason of such appointment be disqualified from any other employment. 
(Ord. No. R-67, § 1(part), 1998) 
2.33.090 - Other costs of defense. 
    A public defender may apply to the municipal court for payment of expenses in addition to payment for the service provided. The city shall pay such reasonable defense costs as are ordered by the court after notice to the city and hearing. No costs shall be incurred at public expense unless prior approval of the court is obtained.

CHAPTER 2.70 - CODE OF ETHICS FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES 

2.70.010 - Policy declaration. 
    High moral and ethical standards among public officials and public employees are essential to gain and maintain the confidence of the public because such confidence is essential to the conduct of free government. They are agents of the people and hold their positions for the benefit of the people. The proper operation of democratic government requires of public officials and public employees that they be independent and impartial when establishing policy and that their positions never be used for personal gain. A code of ethical conduct is necessary for the guidance of public officials and public employees where conflicts do occur as well as to prevent conflicts of interest. 
(Ord. No. I-16, § 1, 1972) 
2.70.020 - Definitions. 
    "Public official" and "public employee" include all elected and appointed officers of the city, all employees of the city and the members of all city boards and commissions, whether compensated by wage or salary or not. 
(Ord. No. I-16, § 2, 1972) 
2.70.030 - Use of public property. 
    No public official or public employee shall use or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such public official or public employee in the conduct of official business. 
(Ord. No. I-16, § 3(part), 1972) 
2.70.040 - Obligations to citizen. 
    No public official or public employee shall grant, nor shall any citizen attempt to obtain, any special consideration, treatment or advantage beyond that which is available to every other citizen. 
(Ord. No. I-16, § 3(part), 1972) 
2.70.050 - Code of ethics. 
    The purpose of the code of ethics is to assist public officials and public employees to establish guidelines to govern their own conduct. The code is also intended to help develop traditions of responsible public service. No public official or public employee shall engage in any act which is in conflict with the performance of his official duties. A public official or public employee shall be deemed to have a conflict of interest if he: 
(1)  Receives or has any financial interest in any sale to or by the city of any service or property when such financial interest was received with the prior knowledge that the city intended to purchase such property or obtain such service; 
(2)  Accepts or seeks for others any service, information or thing of value on more favorable terms than those granted to the public generally, from any person, firm or corporation having dealings with the city; 
(3)  Accepts any gift or favor from any person, firm or corporation having any dealings with the city if he knows or has reason to know that it was intended to obtain special consideration; 
(4)  Influences the selection of or the conduct of business with a corporation, person or firm having business with the city if he personally or through household relatives has financial interest in or with the corporation, person or firm; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to any transaction specifically authorized by RCW 42.23.030; 
(5)  Is an employee, officer, partner, director or consultant of any corporation, firm or person having business with the city, unless he has disclosed such relationship as provided by subsection (9) of this section; 
(6)  Engages in or accepts private employment or renders services for private industry when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties or would impair his independence of judgment or action in the performance of his official duties; 
(7)  Appears in behalf of a private interest before any regulatory governmental agency or represents a private interest in any action or proceeding against the interest of the city in any litigation to which the city is a party, unless he has a personal interest and this personal interest has been disclosed to the regulatory governmental agency. A councilman may appear before regulatory governmental agencies on behalf of constituents in the course of his duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations; however, no public official or public employee shall accept a retainer or compensation that is contingent upon a specific action by a city agency; 
(8)  Directly or indirectly possesses a substantial or controlling interest in any business entity which conducts business or contracts with the city, or in the sale of real estate, materials, supplies or services to the city, without disclosing such interest as provided by subsection (9) of this section. An interest is not a substantial interest if such interest does not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the outstanding securities of the business concern; or, if the interest is an unincorporated business concern, one percent of the net worth of such concern; or the financial interest of a corporation, person or firm does not exceed five percent of the net worth of the public employee and his household relatives; 
(9)  As a councilman, has a financial or other private interest in any legislation, or other matters coming before the council, and fails to disclose such an interest on the records of the city council. This provision shall not apply if the councilman disqualifies himself from voting by stating the nature and extent of such interest. Any other public official or public employee who has a financial or other private interest and who participates in discussion with or gives an official opinion to the council and fails to disclose on the records of the council the nature and extent of such interest is in violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. I-16, § 4, 1972)

(Ord. No. I-16, § 9, 1972) 
CHAPTER 2.71 - APPEARANCE OF FAIRNESS 

2.71.010 - Challenge of decision-Procedure. 
(a)  Washington State law requires that all hearings which are quasi-judicial in nature shall comply with the Appearance of Fairness Doctrine, and decision makers require reasonable advance notice in order to be able to respond. Any person who wishes to challenge any decision maker on the grounds of the appearance of fairness, shall file a written statement on a form provided by the city clerk not later than 4:30 p.m. on the last working day prior to the day of the hearing. 
(b)  Any person who fails to timely file the written statement as required by the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be deemed to have waived any objection on the grounds of appearance of fairness.

(b)  This chapter also authorizes the indemnification of an officer, employee or volunteer of the city in accordance with RCW 36.16.138 and chapter 48.62 RCW, as hereafter amended. 
(Ord. No. S-18, § 2, 2000) 
2.72.020 - Standard of conduct. 
    This chapter applies to any threatened or pending action, claim or other proceeding against any past or present elected or appointed officer, employee or volunteer of the city, to the extent the conduct arises out of and is within the scope of such person in good faith performance, purported performance, or failure of performance of his or her official duties. 
(Ord. No. S-18, § 3, 2000) 
2.72.030 - Determination of conduct. 
    Unless ordered or adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, the defense and indemnification of an elected or appointed officer, employee, or volunteer may be authorized only as follows: 
(1)  To the extent that the claimant has been successful on the merits; and 
(2)  Where there has been a determination, by a majority vote of all the city council not interested in or a party to the action, claim or other proceeding, that the standard of conduct requirement in section 2.72.020 has been satisfied. In the event a majority vote cannot be obtained because of the interest of members of the city council, then all members of the city council shall be permitted to vote. 
(Ord. No. S-18, § 4, 2000) 
2.72.040 - Notice.

No. O-48, § 1(part), adopted 1987; Ord. No. R-12, § 1, adopted 1997. 

2.74.010 - Surplus city property. 
    Whenever it appears to the mayor that any real or personal property owned by the city no longer has utility to the city and it would be in the best interest of the city to sell and dispose of the property, the mayor is authorized to dispose of the real or personal property as follows. 
(1)  If the reasonable value for a parcel or portion thereof of real property or an item of personal property has greater value than $5,000.00, the mayor shall refer the matter to the city council for consideration and action. 
(2)  For real and personal property having a value of less than $5,000.00, the mayor may declare the same as surplus and sell or dispose of the property as set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. V-93, § 3, 7-24-2012) 
2.74.020 - Sale of surplus property. 
    Disposing of property. Real property or personal property with a value less than $5,000.00 ("surplus property") which no longer has utility to the city may be disposed of at public or private sale with the proceeds from such sale paid into the fund from which such property was acquired. Surplus property will be offered for sale, transfer or donation through one of the following methods: 
a.  Sale or transfer to other governmental entity; 
b.  Sale to the general public by auction, sealed bid or negotiation; or 
c.  Donation to an organization that supports the poor or the infirm, upon agreement to use the property for such purposes. 
(1)  Disposal priorities. 
a.  Surplus property will be transferred or sold for reasonable value, if practical. 
b.  Surplus property that does not have a reasonable market value with the cost of sale or disposition exceeding its value may, at the discretion of the mayor, be disposed of in the most efficient and expeditious manner. 
(2)  Valuation. The minimum price to be obtained for the sale of surplus property shall be established by the mayor through either: 
a.  An appraisal of the property by a person knowledgeable or experienced in valuing such property; 
b.  Review of similar property offered for sale through generally acceptable commercial transactions such as public/private offers found in a newspaper, trade publication, internet site or other reasonable source; or 
c.  Through an exercise of reasonable judgment based upon an opinion of value from persons familiar with the property. 
Real property with an estimated value in excess of $5,000.00 shall have the minimum price set based upon the opinion of an individual either licensed to sell and offer real estate or certified to perform written appraisals in the State of Washington. 
(3)  Utility property. Whenever real or personal property has been acquired for public utility purposes, which no longer has utility to the needs of the city, a public hearing shall be held before the city council before the property may be lease, sold or conveyed. RCW 35.94.040. At the public hearing, the city council shall consider a resolution that identifies the surplus property; provided that for items of personal property with an estimated value of less than $5,000.00 per item, the resolution may state "Miscellaneous items of personal property, not exceeding $5,000.00 per item,." are set forth on an attached exhibit. The resolution may also identify certain utility property that will be disposed of through a recycling or other specialized company, such as transformers, wires and other facilities where it is in the public interest to dispose of these items according to good utility practices. 
(4)  Methods of disposal. 
a.  Public auction. The city may dispose of surplus property through auction to the general public conducted by the city, its agent or any local governmental entity. 
b.  Sealed bid. The city may dispose of surplus property through sealed bid, provided: the city places public notice in a newspaper of general circulation and on the city website. Bids shall be opened and announced to the public at the time and place stated in the offer requesting bids. The city shall accept the highest bid for the property, provided such bid is equal to or greater than the established minimum price. Nothing herein prevents the mayor or city council from rejecting all bids. A bid request is an invitation to make an offer to purchase property. Acceptance occurs through payment of consideration or other written acknowledgment by the city. 
c.  Negotiation. Sale through negotiation shall be done at arms-length, which means there is a willing seller and a willing buyer with neither party obligated to buy or sell the property. A good faith attempt shall be made by the mayor or designee to obtain a reasonable price that reflects the market value of the property. 
d.  Notice. The notice of the surplus property shall include a description of the item, the date for the public bid opening and a statement that further information may be obtained through the office of the city clerk. The date of notice on the city website and in the newspaper shall be at least ten days prior to the bid opening. When a public hearing is required, the notice of the public hearing, shall be set forth on the city council agenda and be posted on the city's website. Notice and publication in newspaper of general circulation shall not be necessary when the sale is to another governmental entity or the city determines that the property will be donated to an organization that supports the poor or the infirm.

2.74.040 - Warranty, guarantee of quality, and conveyance. 
    All sales of surplus property shall be "as is" and the city takes no responsibility for, and makes no guarantee with respect to the sold items. To the extent known, the city shall disclose significant defects prior to sale. No sale shall be invalid due to a defect discovered after sale which may have been discovered by reasonable inspection of the property. This condition of sale is automatically incorporated into all transactions between the city and the purchasers of surplus property. 
    The mayor and city clerk are authorized to execute such documents as are necessary to convey the property to the purchaser. In the event it is necessary to convey real property, the deed shall be presented to city council for final approval.

(Ord. No. V-93, § 5, 7-24-2012)

CHAPTER 5.25 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES 

5.25.010 - Purpose. 
(a)  The city recognizes that there are adult entertainment uses which, due to their nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when located in close proximity to residential neighborhoods and schools, thereby having deleterious impacts upon the quality of life in the surrounding areas. It has been acknowledged by courts and communities across the nation that state and local governmental entities have a special concern in regulating the operation of such businesses under their jurisdiction to insure the adverse secondary effects of the establishments are minimized. 
(b)  This chapter is intended to protect the general public health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry of the city through the regulation of the operations and licensing of adult entertainment devices, premises, and personnel of adult entertainment businesses. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any constitutionally protected sexually oriented or explicit communicative materials, or communicative performances. The regulations set forth herein are intended to prevent and control health, safety, and welfare issues, the decline in neighborhood conditions in and around adult entertainment businesses, and to prevent dangerous and unlawful conduct associated with these facilities. This chapter may not be construed as permitting or promoting obscene conduct or material.

c.  In considering in individual cases where a customer knew or had reason to know of an under billing error, the adjusting official may consider a customer's status as a single-family account compared to a larger volume user, with a presumption that larger volume users should have better awareness of the status of their service consumption and obligation to make proper payment therefore. Under billings because of customer error or where is appears a customer knew or should have known of the error should be paid in full. 
(2)  Overbill. Where an account is overbilled or overpaid because of city error, not the result of customer fault, the refund period is up to six months from the time the error is reported to the city. Approved refunds are generally administered by an account credit for the premises served.

(c)  "Alarm system user" means the person who owns or has control over any premises where an alarm system is maintained.

(e)  "Emergency response personnel" means law enforcement, firefighting or emergency dispatch personnel, or any other person or entity responsible for responding to an alarm system.

(2)  The alarm system user may petition the chief to reinstate police response to an alarm. The chief rescinds the non-response order if the alarm system user satisfactorily demonstrates that the cause of the previous false alarms has been corrected. In determining whether to rescind a non-response order the chief uses criteria set forth in the rules and regulations made pursuant to subsection (a). 
(3)  When a non-response order has been rescinded, the alarm system will be on probationary status for a period of time not to exceed one year. If the repeated instances of false alarms continue during the probationary period, the non-response order may be reinstated.

(Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
10.04.030 - Designation of responsible official. 
(1)  For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the mayor or his designee. 
(2)  For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of the required environmental impact statement (EIS), and perform any other functions assigned to the "lead agency" or "responsible official" by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in WAC 173-806-020. 
(3)  The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules (WAC Chapter 197-11) and make them available in accordance with RCW chapter 42.17.

10.04.040 - Lead agency determination and responsibilities. 
(a)  The department within the city receiving an application for or initiating a proposal that involves a nonexempt action shall determine the lead agency for that proposal under WAC 197-11-050, 197-11-253 and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940; unless the lead agency has been previously determined or the department is aware that another department or agency is in the process of determining the lead agency. 
(b)  When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the department receiving the application shall determine the responsible official who shall supervise compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an EIS is necessary, shall supervise preparation of the EIS. 
(c)  When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the DNS or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required under WAC 197-11-600. 
(d)  If the city or any of its departments receives a lead agency determination made by another agency that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within 15 calendar days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition the department of ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946 within the 15-day time period.

(e)  Departments of the city are authorized to make agreements as to lead agency status or shared lead agency duties for a proposal under WAC 197-11-942 and 197-11-944; provided that the responsible official and any department that will incur responsibilities as the result of such agreement approve the agreement. 
(f)  When the lead agency is other than the city, any city department contributing information to change a lead agency's determination for a private project shall base their recommendations in conjunction with other agencies having jurisdiction over the proposal. 
(g)  When the city is lead agency for a Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) remedial action, the department of ecology shall be provided an opportunity under WAC 197-11- 253(5) to review the environmental documents prior to public notice being provided. If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with one public comment period under WAC 197-11-253(6), the city/county shall decide jointly with [the department of] ecology who receives the comment letters and how copies of the comment letters will be distributed to the other agency. 
(Ord. No. S-7, § 2, 2000; Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984)

(d)  The city shall complete threshold determinations on actions where the applicant recommends in writing that an EIS be prepared, because of the probable significant adverse environmental impact(s) described in the application, within 28 days of receiving an adequate application and completed checklist. 
(Ord. No. S-7, § 3, 2000; Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
10.04.060 - Additional timing considerations. 
(1)  For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city's staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission.

CHAPTER 10.08 - CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS AND THRESHOLD DETERMINATIONS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Prior ordinance history: J-40 and M-9. 

10.08.010 - Purpose of this part and adoption by reference. 
    This part contains the rules for deciding whether a proposal has a "probable significant adverse environmental impact" requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) to be prepared. This part also contains rules for evaluating the impacts of proposals not requiring an EIS. The city adopts the following sections by reference, as supplemented in this part: 
WAC 197-11-300 Purpose of this part. 305 Categorical exemptions. 310 Threshold determination required. 315 Environmental checklist. 330 Threshold determination process. 335 Additional information. 340 Determination of non-significance (DNS). 350 Mitigated DNS. 355 Optional DNS process. 360 Determination of significance (DS)/initiation of scoping. 390 Effect of threshold determination.  
(Ord. No. S-7, § 4, 2000; Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
10.08.020 - Use of exemptions. 
(1)  Each department within the city that receives an application for a license or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is exempt. If a proposal is exempt, none of the procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The city shall not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal. 
(2)  In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the department shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-050). If a proposal includes exempt and nonexempt actions, the department shall determine the lead agency, even if the license application that triggers the department's consideration is exempt. 
(3)  If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions, the city may authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements of this chapter, except that: 
(a)  The city shall not give authorization for: 
(i)  Any nonexempt action, 
(ii)  Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact, or 
(iii)  Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives; 
(b)  A department may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and 
(c)  A department may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved. 
(Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
10.08.030 - Environmental checklist. 
(1)  A completed environmental checklist (or a copy), in the form provided in WAC 197-11-960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining the responsible official and for making the threshold determination. 
(2)  For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the environmental checklist for that proposal. 
(3)  The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, if the applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or on proposals currently under consideration. 
(4)  All checklists shall be reviewed by building official/fire chief, director of public works, parks director, city engineer and planning director or the representative of each, prior to being submitted to the responsible official. Each such official shall endorse the checklist, note whether environmental impact will result, what impact is likely to occur, mitigating measures, if any, would substantially reduce any such impact and the feasibility of requiring such of the applicant. 
(Ord. No. S-7, § 5, 2000; Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
10.08.040 - Mitigated DNS. 
(a)  As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made by the applicant. 
(b)  An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must: 
(1)  Follow submission of a permit application and environmental checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and 
(2)  Precede the city's actual threshold determination for the proposal. 
(c)  The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice within 28 days. The response shall: 
(1)  Be in writing; 
(2)  State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are leading the city to consider a DS; and 
(3)  State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications. 
(d)  As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation measures. 
(e)  When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the determination within 28 days of receiving the changed or clarified proposal: 
(1)  If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2); 
(2)  If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate; 
(3)  The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications, changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example, proposals to "control noise" or "prevent stormwater runoff" are inadequate, whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or "construct 200-foot stormwater retention pond at Y location" are adequate. 
(f)  A mitigated DNS is issued under either WAC 197-11-340(2) requiring a 14-day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the notice of application. 
(g)  Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city. 
(h)  If the city's tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the proposal, the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS). 
(i)  The city's written response under subsection (b) of this section shall not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary discussion of clarifications or changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the clarifications or changes in its threshold determination. 
(Ord. No. S-7, § 6, 2000; Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
CHAPTER 10.12 - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT (EIS)

(Ord. No. N-39, § l(part), 1984) 
10.12.020 - Preparation of EIS-Additional considerations. 
(1)  Preparation of draft and final EISs (DEIS and FEIS) and draft and final supplemental EISs (SEIS) is the responsibility of the planning department under the direction of the responsible official. Before the city issues an EIS, the responsible official shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter and WAG Chapter 197-11. 
(2)  The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by city staff, the applicant, or by a consultant selected by the city or the applicant. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the city will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the city's procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution. 
(3)  The city may require an applicant to provide information the city does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not required to supply information that is not required under this chapter or that is being requested from another agency. (This does not apply to information the city may request under another ordinance or statute.) 
(Ord. No. N-39, § l(part), 1984) 
10.12.030 - Additional elements to be covered in an EIS. 
    The following additional elements are part of the environment for the purpose of EIS content, but do not add to the criteria for threshold determinations or perform any other function or purpose under this chapter: 
(1)  Economy; 
(2)  Social policy analysis; 
(3)  Cost-benefit analysis. 
(Ord. No. N-39, § l(part), 1984)

(Ord. No. N-39, § 1(part), 1984) 
10.16.020 - Public notice. 
(a)  Whenever possible, the city shall integrate the public notice required under this section with existing notice procedures for the city's nonexempt permits or approvals required for the proposal. 
(b)  Whenever the city issues a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2) or a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3) the city shall give public notice as follows: 
(1)  If public notice is required for a nonexempt permit, the notice shall state whether a DS or a DNS has been issued and when comments are due. 
(2)  If an environmental document is issued concurrently with the notice of application, the public notice requirements for the notice of application in RCW 36.70B.- 110(4) will suffice to meet the SEPA public notice requirements in WAC 197-11-510(1). 
(3)  If no public notice is required for the permit or approval, the city shall give notice of the DNS or DS by one of the following methods, as specified by the responsible official: 
(A)  Posting the property, for site specific proposals; 
(B)  Publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city; 
(C)  Notifying public or private groups, which have expressed interest in a certain proposal or in the type of proposal being considered; 
(D)  Notifying the news media; 
(E)  Placing notices in appropriate regional, neighborhood, or trade journals; 
(F)  Publishing notice in agency newsletters and/or sending notice to agency mailing lists (either general lists or lists for specific proposals or subject areas); 
(G)  As directed by the responsible official. 
(4)  Whenever the city issues a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), the city shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in the DS as required in WAC 197-11-408 and in the public notice. 
(c)  If a DNS is issued using the optional DNS process, the public notice requirements for a notice of application in RCW 36.70B.110(4) as supplemented by the requirements in WAC 197-11-355 will suffice to meet the SEPA public notice requirements in WAC 197-11-510(1). 
(d)  Whenever the city issues a DEIS under WAC 197-11-455(5) or a SEIS under WAC 197-11-620, notice of the availability of those documents shall be given by: 
(1)  Indicating the availability of the DEIS in any public notice required for a nonexempt license; and 
(2)  Accomplishing one of the methods listed in 10.16.020(b)(3), as specified by the responsible official. 
(e)  Whenever possible, the city shall integrate the public notice required under this section with existing notice procedures for the city's nonexempt permit(s) or approval(s) required for the proposal. 
(f)  The city may require an applicant to complete the public notice requirements for the applicant's proposal at his or her expense, or otherwise may charge a fee sufficient to cover the city's entire cost of meeting the public notice requirements. 
(g)  Public notice for projects that qualify as planned actions shall be tied to the underlying permit as specified in WAC 197-11-172(3).

(1)  Notification of applicability 
a.  In addition to the City of Cheney established public notification for adoption of an ordinance, a notice of availability of a summary of this chapter, a notice of the requirements and criteria for affected employers to comply with the ordinance, and subsequent revisions shall be published at least once in the city's official newspaper not more than 30 days after passage of this chapter or revisions. 
b.  Affected employers located in the city are to receive written notification that they are subject to this chapter. Such notice shall be addressed to the company's chief executive officer, senior official, CTR program manager, or registered agent at the worksite. Such notification shall provide 90 days for the affected employer to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city or its contractor. 
c.  Affected employers that, for whatever reason, do not receive notice within 30 days of passage of the ordinance and are either notified or identify themselves to the city or its contractor within 90 days of the passage of the ordinance will be granted an extension to assure up to 90 days within which to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city or its contractor. 
d.  Affected employers that have not been identified or do not identify themselves within 90 days of the passage of the ordinance and do not perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city or its contractor within 90 days from the passage of the ordinance are in violation of this chapter. 
e.  If an affected employer has already performed a baseline measurement, or an alternative acceptable to the city or its contractor, under previous iterations of this chapter, the employer is not required to perform another baseline measurement. 
(2)  Newly affected employers . 
a.  Employers meeting the definition of "affected employer" in this chapter must identify themselves to the city or its contractor within 90 days of either moving into the boundaries outlined in the CTR plan adopted in (section 11.80.040 above) or growing in employment at a worksite to 100 or more affected employees.

b.  Newly affected employers identified as such shall be given 90 days to perform a baseline measurement consistent with the measurement requirements specified by the city or its contractor. Employers who do not perform a baseline measurement within 90 days of receiving written notification that they are subject to this chapter are in violation of this chapter. 
c.  Not more than 90 days after receiving written notification of the results of the baseline measurement, the newly affected employer shall develop and submit a CTR program to the city or its contractor. The program will be developed in consultation with (city or its contractor listed in section 11.80.060 above) to be consistent with the goals of the CTR plan adopted in [this chapter]. The program shall be implemented not more than 90 days after approval by the city or its contractor. Employers who do not implement an approved CTR program according to this schedule are in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties outlined in (section 11.80.110 (d)) below. 
(3)  Change in status as an affected employer . Any of the following changes in an employer's status will change the employer's CTR program requirements:

b.  If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees within the same 12 months, that employer will be considered an affected employer for the entire 12 months and will be subject to the same program requirements as other affected employers. 
c.  If the same employer returns to the level of 100 or more affected employees 12 or more months after its change in status to an "unaffected" employer, that employer shall be treated as a newly affected employer and will be subject to the same program requirements as other newly affected employers. 
(Ord. No. W-61, § 9, 2-24-2015) 
11.80.080 - Requirements for employers-RCW 70.94.531. 
    An affected employer is required to make a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, to develop and implement a CTR program that will encourage its employees to reduce VMT per employee and increase non drive alone commute trips.

n.  Provision of a program of parking incentives such as a rebate for employees who do not use the parking facilities; 
o.  Establishment of a program to permit employees to work part- or full-time at home or at an alternative worksite closer to their homes which reduces commute trips; 
p.  Establishment of a program of alternative work schedules, such as a compressed workweek, which reduces commute trips; 
q.  Implementation of other measures designed to facilitate the use of high-occupancy vehicles, such as on-site day care facilities, emergency taxi services, or guaranteed ride home programs; 
r.  Charging employees for parking, and/or the elimination of free parking; and 
s.  Other measures that the employer believes will reduce the number and length of commute trips made to the site. 
(3)  CTR program report and description. Affected employers shall review their program and file a regular progress report with the city or its contractor in accordance with the format provided by the City or its contractor. The CTR program report and description outlines the strategies to be undertaken by an employer to achieve the commute trip reduction goals for the reporting period. Employers are encouraged to consider innovative strategies and combine program elements in a manner that will best suit their location, site characteristics, business type, and employees' commuting needs. Employers are further encouraged to cooperate with each other to implement program elements. At a minimum, the employer's CTR program report and description must include: 
a.  A general description of the employment site location, transportation characteristics, employee parking availability, on-site amenities, and surrounding services; 
b.  The number of employees affected by the CTR program and the total number of employees at the site;

e.  A statement of organizational commitment to provide appropriate resources to the program to meet the employer's established goals. 
(4)  Biennial measure of employee commute behavior . In addition to the baseline measurement, employers shall conduct a program evaluation as a means of determining worksite progress toward meeting CTR goals. As part of the program evaluation, the employer shall distribute and collect commute trip reduction program employee questionnaires (surveys) at least once every two years, and strive to achieve at least a 70 percent response rate from employees at the worksite. 
(Ord. No. W-61, § 10, 2-24-2015) 
11.80.090 - Record keeping. 
    Affected employers shall maintain a copy of their approved CTR program description and report, their CTR program employee questionnaire results, and all supporting documentation for the descriptions and assertions made in any CTR report to the city or its contractor for a minimum of 48 months.

(Ord. No. W-61, § 11, 2-24-2015) 
11.80.100 - Schedule and process for CTR program description and report. 
(a)  Document review. The city or its contractor shall provide the employer with written notification if a CTR program is deemed unacceptable. The notification must give cause for any rejection. If the employer receives no written notification of extension of the review period of its CTR program or comment on the CTR program or annual report within 90 days of submission, the employer's program or annual report is deemed accepted. The city or its contractor may extend the review period up to 90 days. The implementation date for the employer's CTR program will be extended an equivalent number of days. 
(b)  Schedule. Upon review of an employer's initial CTR program, the city or its contractor shall establish the employer's regular reporting date. This report will be provided in a form provided by the city or its contractor consistent with (section 11.80.080(3)) above. 
(c)  Modification of CTR program elements. Any affected employer may submit a request to the City or its contractor for modification of CTR requirements. Such request may be granted if one of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The employer can demonstrate it would be unable to comply with the CTR program elements for reasons beyond the control of the employer, or 
(2)  The employer can demonstrate that compliance with the program elements would constitute an undue hardship. 
The city or its contractor may ask the employer to substitute a program element of similar trip reduction potential rather than grant the employer's request. 
(d)  Extensions. An employer may request additional time to submit a CTR program description and Report, or to implement or modify a program. Such requests shall be via written notice at least 30 days before the due date for which the extension is being requested. Extensions not to exceed 90 days shall be considered for reasonable causes. The city or its contractor shall grant or deny the employer's extension request by written notice within 10 working days of its receipt of the extension request. If there is no response issued to the employer, an extension is automatically granted for 30 days. Extensions shall not exempt an employer from any responsibility in meeting program goals. Extensions granted due to delays or difficulties with any program element(s) shall not be cause for discontinuing or failing to implement other program elements. An employer's regular reporting date shall not be adjusted permanently as a result of these extensions. An employer's annual reporting date may be extended at the discretion of the city or its contractor. 
(e)  Implementation of employer's CTR program. Unless extensions are granted, the employer shall implement its approved CTR program, including approved program modifications, not more than 90 days after receiving written notice from the city or its contractor that the program has been approved or with the expiration of the program review period without receiving notice from the city or its contractor.

(b)  Program modification criteria. The following criteria for achieving goals for VMT per employee and proportion of non drive alone trips shall be applied in determining requirements for employer CTR program modifications: 
(1)  If an employer meets either or both goals, the employer has satisfied the objectives of the CTR plan and will not be required to improve its CTR program; 
(2)  If an employer makes a good faith effort, as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, but has not met the applicable non drive-alone or VMT goal, no additional modifications are required. 
(3)  If an employer fails to make a good faith effort as defined in RCW 70.94.534(2) and this chapter, and fails to meet the applicable non drive alone or VMT reduction goal, the city or its contractor shall direct the employer to revise its program within 30 days to come into compliance with the measures defined by RCW 70.94.534(2), including specific recommended program modifications. In response to the recommended modifications, the employer shall submit a revised CTR program description and report, including the requested modifications or equivalent measures, within 30 days of receiving written notice to revise its program. The city or its contractor shall review the revisions and notify the employer of acceptance or rejection of the revised program. If a revised program is not accepted, the city or its contractor will send written notice to that effect to the employer within 30 days and, if necessary, require the employer to attend a conference with program review staff for the purpose of reaching a consensus on the required program. A final decision on the required program will be issued in writing by the city or its contractor within ten working days of the conference.

12.62.030 - General provisions. 
(a)  When connection permits are required. Every owner of property which abuts a roadway where limited access rights have not been acquired, has a right to reasonable access, but may not have the right to a particular means of access to the roadway system. The right of access to the roadway may be restricted if, pursuant to local regulation, reasonable access to the roadway can be provided by way of another public road which abuts the property. All new connections including alterations and improvements to existing connections to roadways shall require a connection permit. Such permits, if issued, shall be issued only after issuance of development approval where such approval is required, unless other interagency coordination procedures are in effect. The alteration or closure of any existing access connection caused by changes to character, intensity of development, or use of the property served by the connection or the construction of any new access connection shall not be initiated prior to obtaining a connection permit from the city. Use of a new connection at the location specified in the permit is not authorized until the permittee constructs or modifies the connections in accordance with the permit requirements. If a property owner or permittee holding a valid connection permits wishes to change the character, use or intensity of the property or development served by the connection, the city must be contacted to determine whether a new connection permit would be required. 
(b)  Responsibility for other approvals. Connection permits authorize construction improvements to be built by the permittee on city right-of-way. It is the responsibility of the applicant or permittee to obtain any other local permits or other agency approvals that may be required, including satisfaction of all environmental regulations. It is also the responsibility of the applicant to acquire any property rights necessary to provide continuity from the applicant's property to the city right-of-way if the applicant's property does not abut the right-of-way. 
(c)  Cost of construction. 
(1)  Permittee. The cost of construction or modification of a connection shall be the responsibility of the permittee, including the cost of modification of any connection required as a result of changes in property site use. 
(2)  City. Existing permitted connections impacted by the city's work program and which, in the consideration of the city, necessitate modification, relocation or replacement in order to meet current city connection location, quantity, spacing and design standards, shall be modified, relocated or replaced in kind by the city at no cost to the permittee. The cost of further enhancements or modification to the altered, relocated or replaced connections desired by the permittee shall be the responsibility of the permittee. 
(d)  City responsibility. The director has the responsibility to issue permits and authority to approve, disapprove, and revoke such permits, and to close connections, with cause. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.040 - Connection categories. 
    All connections, public or private shall be determined by the city to be in one of the following categories: 
(1)  "Category I-minimum connection" provides connection to the roadway system for up to ten single family residences, a duplex, or a small multifamily complex of up to ten dwelling units, which use a common connection. The category shall also apply to permanent connections to agricultural and forest lands, including field entrances; connections for the operation, maintenance and repair of utilities; and connections serving other low volume traffic generators expected to have an average weekday vehicle trips ends (AWDVTE) of 100 or less. 
(2)  "Category II-minor connection" provides connections to the roadway system for medium volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE of 1,500 or less, but not included in Category I. 
(3)  "Category III-major connection" provides connection to the roadway system for high volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE exceeding 1,500. 
(4)  "Category IV-temporary connection" provides a temporary, time limited, connection to the roadway system for a specific property for a specific use with a specific traffic volume. Such uses include, but are not limited to, logging, forest land clearing, temporary agricultural uses, temporary construction, and temporary emergency access. The city reserves the right to remove any temporary connection at its sole discretion and at the expense of the property owner after the expiration of the permit. Further, a temporary connection permit does not bind the city in any way, to the future issuance of a permanent connection permit at the temporary connection location. 
(5)  "Nonconforming connection" designation may be issued for Category I through IV permits after an analysis and determination by the city that a conforming connection cannot be made and a finding that the denial of a connection would leave the property without a reasonable means of access to the public road system. In such instances, the permit shall be noted as nonconforming and contain specific restrictions provisions, including limits on the maximum vehicular use of the connection, the future availability of alternate means of access for which a conforming connection permit could be obtained, the removal of the nonconforming connection at the time the conforming access is available, and other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of RCW chapter 47.50. 
(6)  "Median opening" includes openings requested for both new connections and for existing connections. New median openings proposed as part of a new driveway connection shall be reviewed as part of the permit application review process. Requests for construction of new median openings to serve existing permitted connections shall require a reevaluation of the location, quantity, design of existing connection, and traffic at the existing connections. The property owner must file a new connection permit application, for the proper connection category, showing the new proposed median opening location and design and its relationship to the existing or modified driveway connections. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the city from closing an existing median opening where operational or safety reasons require the action. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.050 - Conceptual review. 
    Prior to filing a connection permit application and prior to receipt of development approval, all permit applicants, but in particular those applying for Category II and Category III connections, are strongly encouraged to request, in writing, a conceptual review of the site plan and proposed connection locations with the city. The purpose of the conceptual review is to expedite the overall review process by establishing the permit category, number, type and general location of connections to the property early in the planning stages of a proposed development or a proposed significant change in property site use, or to determine that the connection as requested cannot be permitted. The conceptual review does not constitute final city approval of the location and design of the connection. If deemed appropriate, especially on the more complex proposals, the city shall establish the date for a conceptual review meeting to be held within two weeks of the receipt of the written request, unless a later date is requested by the applicant. If a meeting is scheduled, representatives of the local governmental land use planning authority will be invited to attend. Within four weeks following the conceptual review meeting, or receipt of the request if no meeting is scheduled, the city will provide the applicant written notice of the city's conceptual review findings, provided all needed information to complete the review has been received from the applicant. These findings are nonbinding on the city and the developer. Additional detailed information received during the application process, changes in the proposed development, or changes in the existing or planning operational characteristics of the city's roadway system may necessitate modifications of the connections agreed to in the conceptual approval. The conceptual review findings can be used by the developer in the site plan review/approval process with the local government having jurisdiction over the development as indicating coordination of connection location, quantity and design with the city and of preliminary city findings on the proposed connections. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995)

The permit requirements shall be binding on the permittee, the permittee's successors, heirs and assigns, the permit application signators, and all future owners and occupants of the property. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.100 - Construction requirements. 
(a)  Preconstruction conference. The director may require a preconstruction conference prior to any work being performed on the city's right-of-way. When required by provisions in the permit, the director will schedule a preconstruction conference. The preconstruction conference should be attended by the necessary personnel to assure compliance with the terms and provisions of the permit. 
(b)  Time limit. Substantial construction of the connection shall begin within 90 days of the effective date of the permit, unless a longer time is approved by the director or a time extension is requested by the applicant and approved by the director. Construction shall be completed within 120 days of the date of issuance of the permit, unless a time extension is approved by the director. As a condition of the permit, the director may further limit construction time, if the director determines that such limitation is warranted. Failure to comply with the time limits specified in the permit shall result in an automatic expiration of the permit following written notification to the permittee. For any permit which expires for failure to begin construction or to complete construction within the specified time limits, the director may require a new application, including the payment of the required application fee prior to the initiation of any construction. 
(c)  Posting of permit. The approved connection permit shall be displayed in a prominent location, protected from the weather, within the vicinity of the connection construction. 
(d)  Disruption of traffic.

(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.110 - Nonconforming connection permits. 
    The director may issue a permit for a connection not meeting city location and spacing criteria standards if it finds that a conforming connection is not attainable at the time of the permit application submittal and that denial would leave the property without a reasonable means of connection to the city's roadway system. The director may issue a connection permit requiring a legally enforceable joint-use connection when determined to be in the best interest of the city for restoring or maintaining the operational efficiency and safety of the city's roadway system. Nonconforming connection permits shall specify conditions or limits including: 
(1)  Traffic volume. The maximum vehicular usage of the connection shall be specified in the permit. 
(2)  Future alternate access. The permit shall specify that a conforming connection be constructed when future alternate means of access become available, and that the nonconforming connection be removed. 
(3)  Users. The permit shall specify the properties to be served by the connection; and any other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of RCW chapter 47.50 or any applicable city ordinances. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.120 - Changes in property site use. 
    The connection permit is issued to the permittee for a particular type of land use generating specific projected traffic volumes at the final stage of proposed development. Any changes made in the use, intensity of development, type of traffic, or traffic flow of the property requires the permittee, their assignee, or property owner to contact the director to determine if further analysis is needed to determine if the change is significant and would require a new permit and modifications to the connection. An engineering study, signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in accordance with RCW chapter 18.43, may be required to document the extent of the change. If modification of the existing connection is required, based on a significant change as determined by the director, the permittee shall acquire a new permit prior to the initiation of any on-site construction to the connection or to the property. 
(1)  Significant change. A significant change is one that would cause a change in the category of the connection permit or one that causes an operational, safety or maintenance problem on the city's roadway system. 
(2)  Notification. Failure to contact the director to determine the need for connection modifications or to apply for a new permit for such modifications prior to initiation or property improvements, land use changes or traffic flow alteration actions shall result in notification to the property owner of intent to revoke the existing permit and closure of the connection to the property. 
(3)  Costs. The permittee is responsible for all costs associated with connection removal, relocation or modification caused by increased or altered traffic flows necessitated by changes to facilities, use, or to the nature of the business on the property. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.130 - Permit modification, revocation, closure or permitted connections. 
(a)  Revocation criteria. All connection permits issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter remain valid until revoked. The director may initiate action to revoke any permit if significant changes have occurred in the use, design or traffic flow of the property requiring the relocation, alteration or closure of the connection; if the connection was not constructed at the location or to the design specified in the permit; or if the permit provisions were not met; or if the connection causes a safety or operational problem on the city's roadway system. The process to be followed by the director in the revocation of permits shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter. The notification process is as follows: 
(1)  Notification, correction of deficiencies. The director shall serve notice, to the permittee, permittee's successors or assigns, or property owner with a copy to the occupant, for any connection found to be in noncompliance with the conditions of the permit or this chapter. The notice will identify and request that the deficiencies be corrected within 30 days of service of the notice. The notice shall further advise that the director's determination of noncompliance or deficiencies shall become final and conclusive 30 calendar days following service of the notice unless the violations are corrected or the permittee submits a schedule for correcting said violations in a timely manner that is acceptable to the director. 
(b)  Costs. The permittee, assignee or property owner shall be responsible for the costs of closure due to revocation of a connection permit pursuant to this chapter. 
(c)  Emergency action. This chapter shall not restrict the director's right to take immediate remedial action, including the closure of a connection if there is an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety and welfare, pursuant to RCW chapter 47.32. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.140 - Closure of unpermitted connections. 
    Closure criteria, permit requirements. Any unpermitted connections to the city's roadway system which were in existence on July 1, 1990, shall not require the issuance of a permit and may continue to provide connection to the city's roadway system, unless the property owner had received written notification initiating connection closure from the director prior to July 1, 1990, or unless the director determines that the unpermitted connection does not meet minimum acceptable standards of roadway safety. The director may require that a permit be obtained if a significant change occurs in the use, design or traffic flow of the connection or of the city's roadway system to which it provides access. If a permit is not obtained, the director may initiate action to close the unpermitted connection point pursuant to RCW 47.50.040 or any applicable city ordinances. Any unpermitted connection opened subsequent to July 1, 1990, is subject to closure by the director. The process to be followed by the city in the closure of an unpermitted connection shall be consistent with this chapter. The notification process is as follows: 
(1)  Notification. The director shall serve notice, in accordance with rules adopted under this chapter, upon the property owner of a connection to the city's roadway system which is found by the director to be unpermitted. This notice shall clearly describe the roadway connection violation and shall establish a 30-day time limit for either applying for a connection permit or requesting an extension of the 30-day time limit which must be approved by the director. The notice will further advise the property owner that failure to act in either of the prescribed ways will result in city closure of the unpermitted connection. 
(2)  Permit application. If a permit application is filed within the 30 days, and the application is denied, the city shall notify the property owner of the denial. The property owner may then proceed with the permit application revision process set forth in this chapter. Failure to act in this prescribed way within the time period set forth in the rules will result in city closure of the unpermitted connection. If the location and design of the connection in the permit application are acceptable to the director, the existing connection may continue to be used for a specified period of time or until the connection specified in the permit application is constructed. 
(3)  Approval conditions. Modifications, relocation or closure of unpermitted connections may be required by the director as a requirement of permit approval, subject to the adjudicative proceedings provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. Q-52, § 1(part), 1995) 
12.62.150 - Street access closure-Appeal process. 
(a)  Any party aggrieved by a decision of the director of public works ordering the closure of an unpermitted access or any condition imposed in a final order approving an access permit, shall have the right to appeal to the city council. 
(b)  The council may hear the appeal en banc; assign one or more members of the council to hear the appeal; or appoint a hearing examiner to make findings of fact and conclusions of law to be forwarded to the council on a closed record for final action. 
(c)  These appellate rights shall govern all notices of closure already promulgated by the director and any party aggrieved by a notice of closure issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall be accorded these same rights of appellate review. 
(d)  A notice of appeal is timely if it is filed with the city clerk not later than the close of business on Thursday preceding the regularly scheduled meeting of the council; provided that if there is less than seven calendar days between the date of the certified letter ordering closure and the Thursday preceding a council meeting, the petition for review is deemed timely if filed on or before the Thursday preceding the next council meeting.

CHAPTER 14.20 - NET METERING 

14.20.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of net metering of electricity is to: 
(a)  Encourage private investment in renewable energy resources; 
(b)  Stimulate the economic growth of the community; and 
(c)  Enhance the continued diversification of the energy resources of the community. 
(Ord. No. S-74, § 1(part), 2004) 
14.20.020 - Definitions. 
    The definitions in this section apply throughout the chapter unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 
    Customer-generator means a user of a net metering system. 
    Net metering means measuring the difference between the electricity supplied by an electric utility and the electricity generated by a customer-generator that is fed back to the electric utility over the applicable billing period. 
    Net metering system means a fuel cell, a facility that produces electricity and used and useful thermal energy from a common fuel source, or a facility for the production of electrical energy that generates renewable energy, and that: 
(1)  Uses as its fuel either solar, wind or hydropower; 
(2)  Has a generating capacity of not more than 100 kilowatts; 
(3)  Is located on the customer-generator's premises; 
(4)  Operates in parallel with light department's transmission and distribution facilities; and 
(5)  Is intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer-generator's requirements for electricity. 
    Meter aggregation means the administrative combination of readings from and billing for all meters, regardless of the rate class, on premises owned or leased by a customer-generator located within the service territory of a single electric utility. 
(Ord. No. S-74, § 1(part), 2004; Ord. No. V-88, § 1, 3-13-2012) 
14.20.030 - Net metering required. 
    The city shall offer to make net metering available to eligible customer-generators on a first come, first served basis until the cumulative generating capacity of net metering systems equals 135 kilowatts, which represents one- half of one percent of the light department's peak demand during 1996. 
(Ord. No. S-74, § 1(part), 2004; Ord. No. V-88, § 2, 3-13-2012) 
14.20.040 - Metering. 
    The city shall allow net metering systems to be interconnected using a standard kilowatt-hour meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in two directions. The city council may adopt additional metering requirements after it determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity to comment: 
(1)  That the use of additional metering equipment to monitor the flow of electricity in each direction is necessary and appropriate for the interconnection of net metering systems, after taking into account the benefits and costs of purchasing and installing additional metering equipment; and 
(2)  How the cost of purchasing and installing an additional meter is to be allocated between the customer-generator and the utility. 
(Ord. No. S-74, § 1(part), 2004) 
14.20.050 - Fees. 
    The city shall charge the customer-generator a minimum monthly fee that is the same as the other customers of the electric utility in the same rate class, but shall not charge the customer-generator any additional standby, capacity, interconnection or other fee unless the city council determines after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment that: 
(1)  The light department will incur direct costs associated with interconnecting or administering net metering systems that exceed any offsetting benefits associated with these systems; and 
(2)  Public policy is best served by imposing these costs on the customer-generator rather than allocating these costs among the utility's entire customer base. 
(Ord. No. S-74, § 1(part), 2004) 
14.20.060 - Net energy measurement. 
    The net energy measurement shall be calculated in the following manner: 
(1)  The light department shall measure the net electricity produced or consumed during the billing period, in accordance with normal metering practices. 
(2)  If the electricity supplied by the light department exceeds the electricity generated by the customer-generator and fed back to the light department during the billing period, the customer-generator shall be billed for the net electricity supplied by the electric utility, in accordance with normal metering practices. 
(3)  If electricity generated by the customer-generator exceeds the electricity supplied by the light department, the customer-generator: 
(A)  Shall be billed for the appropriate customer charges for that billing period, in accordance with sections 14.20.030 through 14.20.050 of this chapter; and 
(B)  Shall be credited for the excess kilowatt-hours generated during the billing period, with this kilowatt-hour credit appearing on the bill for the following billing period. 
(4)  If a customer-generator requests, an electric utility shall provide meter aggregation. 
(A)  For customer-generators participating in meter aggregation, kilowatt-hours credits earned by a net metering system during the billing period first shall be used to offset electricity supplied by the electric utility. 
(B)  Not more than a total of one hundred kilowatts shall be aggregated among all customer-generators participating in a generating facility under this subsection. 
(C)  Excess kilowatt-hours credits earned by the net metering system, during the same billing period, shall be credited equally by the electric utility to remaining meters located on all premises of a customer-generator at the designated rate of each meter. 
(D)  Meters so aggregated shall not change rate classes due to meter aggregation under this section. 
(5)  At the beginning of each calendar year, any remaining unused kilowatt-hour credit accumulated during the previous year shall be granted to the light department, without any compensation to the customer-generator. 
(Ord. No. S-74, § 1(part), 2004; Ord. No. V-88, § 3, 3-13-2012) 
14.20.070 - Interconnection requirements. 
(a)  The customer-generator is responsible for the safety and power quality associated with the customer-generator's generating equipment. A net metering system used by a customer-generator shall include, at the customer-generator's own expense, all equipment necessary to meet applicable safety, power quality and interconnection requirements established by the National Electrical Code, National Electrical Safety Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Underwriters Laboratories. 
(b)  The city council, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment, may adopt by regulation additional safety, power quality and interconnection requirements for customer-generators that the city council determines are necessary to protect public safety and system reliability. 
(c)  The customer-generator shall be required to install automatic and manual protective devices to isolate the system from the city's system. This equipment must meet the interrupting rating determined by the city. 
(d)  The customer-generator shall submit to the city for review and approval, an application containing a scaled drawing of the applicant's generation facilities and the nearest utility pole by address and pole number, the generator size and type, the fuel type, a one line wiring drawing showing specific types of equipment, wire sizes and wire type and a discussion of the protection scheme. The applicant shall supply equipment electrical ratings including interrupting ratings provided by the equipment manufacturer. All information shall be submitted in triplicate.

15.04.015 - Purpose and policy. 
(a)  This title sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) operated by the city. It enables the city to comply with state and federal laws that apply to POTWs with significant industrial users, but without a discharge permit program. All actions required, or authorities granted under this title are in accordance with the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.), the Federal Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR part 403), and Chapter 90.48 RCW - Water Pollution Control. The objectives of this title are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; 
(3)  To ensure that the quality of POTW sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations: 
(4)  To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public; 
(5)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge (biosolids) from the POTW; and 
(6)  To promote strategies which reduce the amounts of pollution generated by users, thereby reducing the associated hazards to the POTW and receiving waters. 
(b)  This title shall apply to all users of the POTW. The title defines certain prohibited discharges; sets forth local limits for use by state agencies in the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the recovery of liquidated damages and collection of penalties. 
(Ord. No. R-93, § 1(part), 1999)

CHAPTER 17.08 - FORECLOSURE REGISTRATION PROGRAM 

17.08.020 - Purpose. 
    This chapter establishes a registration program to protect the city from the deterioration, crime, and decline in property value caused by properties in the foreclosure process. The city hereby requires the lender or other responsible party(ies) in the foreclosure process to register such properties with the city to protect the neighborhoods from the negative impacts of absentee ownership including lack of adequate maintenance and security. 
(Ord. No. X-37, § 2, 1-22-2019) 
17.08.030 - Definitions.

    Enforcement officer means the code enforcement officer as defined in CMC 2.58. 
    Evidence of foreclosure status means any condition that on its own or combined with other conditions present would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property is a foreclosure property. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, overgrown and/or dead vegetation; accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail; past due utility notices and/or disconnected utilities; accumulation of trash, junk, and/or debris; statements by neighbors, passersby, delivery agents, or government employees that the property is in foreclosure; the presence of boards over doors, windows or other openings in violation of applicable building code; and for residential properties, the absence of window coverings such as curtains, blinds, and/or shutters; the absence of furnishings and/or personal items consistent with residential habitation. 
    Foreclosure means the legal processes described in Title 61, Revised Code of Washington, in which a mortgagee or other lien holder terminates a property owner's equitable right of redemption to obtain legal and equitable title to the real property pledged as security for a debt or the real property subject to the lien. For purposes of this section, the foreclosure process is not concluded until the property obtained by the mortgagee, lien holder, or their designee, by certificate of title or other means, is sold to a non-related, bona fide purchaser in an arms'-length transaction to satisfy the debt or lien. 
    Foreclosure property means a property that is:

The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates. 
(f)  Residential construction. 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

CHAPTER 19.24 - PARK IMPACT FEES 

19.24.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to help achieve the goals and objectives of the land use and parks and recreation elements of the City of Cheney's comprehensive plan. This title provides for an impact fee to insure that the new residential development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditures necessary to support parks that are reasonably related to the new development. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.010), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.020 - Authority. 
    This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Growth Management Act, RCW chapter 36.70A, and RCW 82.02.050 through RCW 82.02.100. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.020), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.030 - Applicability. 
    This chapter applies to the issuance of all new building permits for residential development and subdivisions within the municipal limits of the city. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.030), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.040 - Exemptions. 
    The following development activities shall be exempt from the payment of impact fees: 
(1)  Reconstruction, remodeling or construction of the following facilities: Shelters or dwelling units for temporary placement which provide housing to persons on a temporary basis for periods of not more than four consecutive weeks. 
(2)  Rebuilding or replacement of previously existing dwellings destroyed or damaged by fire, flood, act of God or other accident or catastrophe; provided that such rebuilding takes place within one year after destruction. 
(3)  Alteration or expansion of an existing building where no additional dwellings are created. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.040), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.050 - Service areas. 
    For the provision of parks, implementation of the capital facilities and parks and recreation elements of the comprehensive plan and the administration of this chapter, a single park service area encompassing the entire city is hereby established. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.050), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.060 - Mitigation of park and recreation impacts required. 
    Whenever the city has approval authority over residential development, approval will be contingent upon the developer's mitigation of the development's impacts on the park and recreation system level of service identified in the city's comprehensive plan through payment of an amount calculated pursuant to section 19.24.080 or 19.24.090, a dedication of land pursuant to section 19.24.100, or a partial credit pursuant to section 19.24.110. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.060), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.070 - Relationship to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). 
    This chapter establishes minimum impact fees which are to be applied to all residential development. These fees are presumed to mitigate impacts of residential uses on parks. However, each development shall be reviewed and be subject to the substantive authority of SEPA for potential adverse environmental impacts on parks not mitigated by this fee. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.070), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.080 - Amount of impact fee. 
(a)  The formula below shall be used to develop mitigation fees for public park and recreation facilities. 
(b)  Level of service. The level of service standard for parks established and documented in the comprehensive plan is ten acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. 
(c)  The formula shall be reviewed in conjunction with the annual comprehensive plan amendment process and modified to reflect changes in park development costs and population estimates. 
(d)  Park development costs. The average costs of a typical five-acre public park have been determined to be at least $703,793. 
5 Acre Land Acquisition $195,009.00 $39,001.84 per acre (based on 2006-08 sales) Irrigation & Landscape $278,784.00 $1.60 per sq. foot (4 acres) Playground $65,000.00 Equipment, freight, install, & surfacing material Restroom $90,000.00 CXT Montrose Model Shelter $75,000.00 16' × 24' shelter, freight, installation Total Estimated Park Cost $703,793.00 Typical 5-acre park  
(e)  Household size. In determining the average household size various sources have been consulted including the City of Cheney Comprehensive Plan, the United States Census Bureau and the Washington State Office of Financial Management. For the purpose of implementing this chapter, the average household sizes are as follows. 
(1)  0-1 bedroom apartment or duplex - 1.0 person per dwelling unit 
(2)  2 bedroom apartment or duplex - 2.0 persons per dwelling unit 
(3)  3+ bedroom apartment or duplex - 2.6 persons per dwelling unit 
(4)  Single-family residential - 2.6 persons per dwelling unit 
(f)  Population estimates for the City of Cheney indicate that from 2009-2014 the City of Cheney is expected to increase by 988 residents (20-year projections divided by 3.33 representing the increase in population over a six-year period). 
(g)  The formula for calculating the park impact fee is as follows: 
(1)  The City of Cheney has determined that 80 percent of the park development costs shall be covered by park impact fees. 
(2)  Park impact fee per person: 
    80 percent of the costs of a typical five acre park/estimated six year population increase projections = per person fee 
    $563,034.00/988 = $570.00 per person 
(3)  Cost per person × person per household = park impact fee per household: 
Per Unit Average Occupancy Fee 0-1 bedroom apartment or duplex 1.0 per dwelling unit $570.00 2 bedroom apartment or duplex 2.0 per dwelling unit $1,140.00 3+ bedroom apartment or duplex 2.6 per dwelling unit $1,482.00 Single-family residential 2.6 per dwelling unit $1,482.00  
(h)  Impact fee allocation. The city shall provide a balance between impact and other sources of public funds to meet its capital project needs. Revenues from property taxes, user fees, sales tax, real estate excise taxes, grants, and other revenue sources will be used to pay the proportionate share of the growth generated capital facilities costs. For the purpose of calculating park impact fees, 80 percent of the cost is anticipated to be generated by the collection of impact fees. The remaining 20 percent is expected to originate from city, county or state sources. Thus the mitigation assessment reflects a 20 percent discount from the actual acquisition costs. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.080), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.090 - Independent fee calculations. 
    If a developer elects not to have the impact fee determined pursuant to section 19.24.080, then: 
(1)  The developer shall prepare and submit to the city an independent fee calculation study for determining the development's mitigation obligation. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made. 
(2)  The mayor and/or his designee shall consider the documentation submitted by the developer but is not required to accept such documentation if it is found to be inaccurate or not reliable. If such findings are made, the director may require the developer to submit additional documentation for consideration. 
(3)  If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is presented, the mayor and/or his designee may adjust the fee as may be appropriate to the particular development, in consideration of the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. 
(4)  When a developer requests an independent fee calculation, the developer shall submit a nonrefundable filing fee as set forth by the city council via resolution and be responsible for all city costs above and beyond this fee. 
(5)  Following approval of a fee pursuant to this section, the mayor and/or his designee shall report the facts and decision to the parks board of commissioners for recommendation and final decision of the city council. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.090), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.100 - Credits for dedication of land. 
(a)  Any claim for credit should be made by the developer at least 30 days prior to the submittal of the subdivision application so as to eliminate or minimize any delays. 
(b)  Dedication of park land may be offered by the developer as total or partial payment of the required impact fee. If the city council accepts such an offer, the credit shall be determined and provided in the following manner: The land shall be appraised by the land owner and credit will be valued at 100 percent of the appraised value. The city reserves the right to seek an additional appraisal, at which time the city's appraisal would supersede the land owner's appraisal. Credit for the dedication of park land shall occur when the property has been conveyed at no charge to, and accepted by, the city in a manner satisfactory to the city council. 
(c)  The city council shall consider the following when determining whether to accept an offer for the dedication of land: 
(1)  Any restrictions, covenants or other constraints placed on the title of the property to be transferred to the city. 
(2)  Consistency with, and implementation of, the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  Availability of adequate public access to the site. All lands to be considered for the dedication of park land shall be fronted by a public road on at least 25 percent of the perimeter. 
(4)  The existence of physical constraints affecting the site such as problems with drainage, erosion, or flooding, or the presence of hazardous waste, which would increase demand on public resources for maintenance and operation. 
(5)  The presence of safety hazards. 
(6)  Constraints due to the presence of environmentally sensitive areas. 
(7)  The physical capability of supporting active recreational opportunities. 
(8)  A completed survey with the property boundaries clearly marked in the field. 
(9)  The market value of the land is found to be commensurate with its value as a park. It is the intent of this provision to avoid accepting expensive land (and crediting the developer) for a facility when there are more affordable alternatives available. 
(10)  If the dedication is smaller than the need identified in the park plan, the city may require that the dedication be located on the perimeter of the development at a location that assures the opportunity for future dedication or acquisition by the city of additional park land to meet the need identified in the park plan. 
(11)  The city also must evaluate how much undeveloped land is currently owned by the City of Cheney for the development of a park and if it is in the best interest of the city to accept more undeveloped land. 
(d)  The criteria for acceptance should be evaluated regularly through the annual comprehensive plan review process. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.100), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.110 - Credit for on-site mitigation. 
(a)  If the developer creates a park facility that is accessible and open to the general public, he or she may receive credit for 100 percent of the approved development costs and value of the land towards the park impact fees imposed by this chapter. 
(1)  The developer must have a detailed park development plan approved by the Cheney Park Board of Commissioners and city council. 
(2)  The plan must address current or future park facility needs as identified in the parks and recreation chapter of the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  The developer must dedicate the land and all improvements to the City of Cheney upon full completion of the park facility development. The credit for the land shall be limited to the value of the land where the park facilities will be located and is limited to the square footage of the improvements. The amount of the credit shall be based on an appraisal of the property prepared by an MAI certified appraiser commissioned and paid for by the developer. The city retains the right to secure their own appraisal if they desire, in which case the city's appraisal would supersede the developer's appraisal. 
(4)  The city will determine the actual amount of credit to be granted under the city's impact fees on the basis of a certified copy of the construction/material costs. The city shall not reimburse the developer for any credit in excess of the amount payable under the city's park impact fee or other park mitigation measures; however it may be utilized for mitigation credit for future developments within the next six years. 
(5)  Upon dedication of the land and improvements the city will take full ownership and will be responsible for maintaining the land where the approved park facilities will be located. 
(b)  If the developer creates a park facility that is not open to the general public but is available for the residents within the development, the developer may receive credit for up to 25 percent of the overall park impact fees owed for the development under the following conditions: 
(1)  The developer or property owner is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the park facility. 
(2)  The developer or property owner assumes ownership and control of the property. 
(3)  The developer or property owner submits covenants, conditions and restrictions pursuant to RCW chapter 64.38, evidencing the obligation of the homeowners' association to maintain and operate the park facility. 
(4)  The city will determine the actual amount of credit to be granted under the city's impact fees on the basis of a certified copy of the construction/material costs. The city shall not reimburse the developer for any credits in excess of the minimum amount payable under the city's park mitigation measures. Credit towards future development is not provided for park facilities that are not open to the general public. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.110), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.120 - Credit for dedication in excess of required mitigation. 
    When a developer proposes a dedication of land or park development improvements which are approved by the city, of which the value exceeds the developer's mitigation obligation, the city shall credit the developer by authorizing a park impact fee credit for future development that occurs within the city. This credit shall be valid for six years from the date of issuance and is transferable to another party. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.120), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.130 - Collection of impact fees. 
    Impact fees shall be assessed and collected prior to issuance of a building permit for any residential development. In lieu of payment of impact fees at time of building permit, an applicant may furnish the city with a performance bond or other form of security in a form acceptable to the city ensuring the payment of the park impact fees by the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.130), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.140 - Use of impact fees. 
(a)  All impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to mitigate the direct impacts of residential development through the purchase and development of land, including reasonable transaction and administrative costs, in accordance with the capital facilities and park and recreation elements of the City of Cheney Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Impact fees shall reasonably benefit new or enhanced development and shall not be used for maintenance or operation. 
(c)  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of capital facilities for which park impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments. 
(d)  Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the city within six years of receipt by the city, unless there is an extraordinary or compelling reason for the fees to be held longer. The city council shall make written findings of the extraordinary and compelling reasons for the fees to be held longer than six years. 
(Ord. No. V-07, § 1(19.24.140), 3-24-2009) 
19.24.150 - Refund of fees paid. 
(a)  Park impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account established by the city solely for the purpose of collection of park impact fees.

The developer must submit an application for such a refund to the clerk-treasurer within 30 days prior to the expiration of the permit. By resolution, the city council may adopt fees to offset administrative costs of collecting and refunding park impact fees. 
(c)  Any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of six years from the date the fee was paid to the city shall be returned to such landowner with interest. The city shall notify a party eligible for a refund of its availability. A person eligible for a refund must submit a request for a refund to the city within one year of the expiration of the six-year period or the date of the notice, whichever is later.

CHAPTER 21.10 - MEASUREMENTS[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ordinance No. W-55, § 2, adopted March 10, 2015, renamed chapter 21.10 from "Development Standards" to "Measurements." 

21.10.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to set the standards for calculating measurements required in the development code. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 20, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.020 - Measuring number of items required. 
A.  When any measurement technique for determining the number of items required or allowed, including but not limited to parking or bicycle spaces, dwelling units or required trees or shrubs, results in a fractional number, the number shall be rounded as follows: 
1.  Minimum requirements . When a regulation is expressed in terms of a minimum requirement, any fractional result will be rounded up to the next consecutive whole number. For example, if a minimum requirement of one tree for every 20 feet is applied to a 35-foot strip, the resulting fraction of 1.75 is rounded up to two required trees. 
2.  Maximum limits . When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum limits, any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower whole number. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 21, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.030 - Measuring distances. 
A.  When any measurement technique for determining required minimum or allowed maximum dimensions, including, but not limited to, height, yards, setbacks, lot coverage, opens space, parking stall size or street width, results in a fractional number, the dimension shall be measured to the nearest inch. Any fraction less than one-half of an inch shall be disregarded and fractions of one-half-inch or larger shall be included in the measurement. Note: Where illustrations conflict with the text of this section, the text shall control. 
B.  Distances are measured horizontally . When determining distances for setbacks, structure dimensions, and buffers, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate property line, critical area boundary, edge of building, structure, storage area, parking area or other object. These distances are not measured by following the topography of the land. 

C.  Measurements are shortest distance . Measurements should reflect the shortest applicable distance, perpendicular to the lot line. 

D.  Measurements of vehicle travel areas . Minimum vehicle travel area for garage entrance setbacks is measured along the shortest side of the vehicle travel area. 

E.  Measurements involving a structure . Measurements involving a structure are made to the closest wall of the structure. Chimneys, eaves, and bay windows up to ten feet in length, are not included in the measurement. Other items, such as covered porches, and entrances are included in the measurement. 
F.  Underground structures . Structures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances. However, this shall not be interpreted to mean that underground construction is allowed to encroach under public rights-of-way, easements or other property without a street use permit. 

G.  Landscaping . Measurements of the dimensions of a landscaped area include only the area that is actually landscaped and not any other elements such as protect curbs. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 22, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.040 - Measuring distances on a map. 
A.  Zone boundaries . Zone boundaries that are shown crossing lots are usually based on a topographic feature or a set measurement from a property line or topographic feature, such as the top of slope or stream bank or middle of a stream. When zone boundaries are shown crossing properties with no clear indication of the basis for the line, exact distances are to be determined by scaling the distances from the official zoning map, using the center of the zoning line. 
B.  Calculating slope from a topographic map . 

(Ord. No. W-22, § 23, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.050 - Measuring height. 
    Height of buildings is measured from the vertical distance from the average grade to the average height of the roof peak of the building, in which case the height shall be measured from average existing grade (prior to development) to the highest point of a structure (see also WAC 173-27-030). 

(Ord. No. W-22, § 24, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.060 - Determining the area of the facade of a building. 
    Criteria for determining the area of the façade of a building. The area of a specific facade of a building is determined by adding the square footage of surface area of each section of wall visible from that perspective. For buildings with more than one wall along one façade, for example, rooms jutting out from the main building or a building where each floor is set back from the floor below, all of the walls are included in the total area. The total area does not include any roof area. 

(Ord. No. W-22, § 25, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.070 - Measuring lot widths and depths. 
    Criteria for measuring lot widths and depths . Lot widths and depths are measured from the midpoints of opposite lot lines. 

(Ord. No. W-22, § 26, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.080 - Setback averaging. 
    Specific setback regulations . Certain regulations allow for setbacks to be averaged. In these situations the required setback may be reduced to the average of the existing setbacks of the lots that are on both sides of the site. The following rules apply in calculating the average: 
(1)  Setback type consistency . The setbacks used for the calculations must be the same type of setback that is being averaged. For example, only front yard setbacks can be used to average a front yard setback; 
(2)  Setbacks that abut the site . Only the setbacks on the lots that abut each side of the site and are on the same street may be used. Setbacks across the street or along a different street may not be used; and 
(3)  Setbacks and lot orientation . When one abutting lot is vacant or if the lot is a corner lot, then the average is of the setback of the non-vacant lot and the required setback for the zone. 


(Ord. No. W-22, § 27, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.090 - Calculating density. 
    The following describes how net density is calculated with certain examples: 
1.  Net densities are calculated by averaging lots sizes over an entire development. Individual lots may vary in size provided they do not exceed the maximum lot area. 
2.  Lot calculation if no street is created: Example in the R-1 Zone. 
Square footage of site / Maximum density = Maximum number of lots 
20,000 sf / 7,000 sf = 2.85 lots or 3 lots when rounded up. 
3.  Lot calculation if a street is created: Example in the R-1 Zone. 
Assume a 15 percent loss when a street is created. 
(Square footage of site x 0.85) / Maximum density = Maximum number of lots 
(43,560 sf x 0.85) / 7,000 sf = 5.28 lots or 5 lots when rounded down. 
4.  Lot calculation if there is a critical area: Example in the CALR Zone. 
Assume a three acre site with a 20,000 square foot wetland and buffer. 
(Square feet of the site including wetland) / Max. density = Maximum number of lots 
(130,680 sf) / 10,000 sf = 13.06 lots or 13 lots when rounded down. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 28, 4-22-2014) 
21.10.100 - Measuring tree diameter. 
A.  Existing trees . Existing trees are measured at a height of 4 1/2 feet above the ground. Trees on slopes are measured from the ground level on the lower side of the tree. If the tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, the trunk is measured at its most narrow point below the split. 
B.  New trees . New trees are measured in caliper inch, which is the diameter of the trunk six inches above the ground for up to and including four inches caliper size and 12 inches above the ground for larger trees. 
C.  Tree diameter . Tree diameter is measured by taking the circumference of the tree at the height, described in Items A and B above, and dividing the result by 3.14. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 29, 4-22-2014)

2 Zero feet when it is a zero lot line development. The opposite side yard shall be at least 10'  
C.  Lot setbacks . 
1.  Setbacks . The zoning code requires that certain portions of a lot be set aside for front, rear and side yards. In general, no portion of a house (except covered front porches, chimneys, and bay windows) may extend up to 50 percent into these required yards. Eaves may project 30 inches into the required setback. Accessory structures and ADU's may be placed in the side or rear yards (such as garages, sheds, decks, porches or arbors) as along as adequate space is available, and certain criterion are met per CMC 21.44. 

2.  Calculation . Yards are measured from the property line to the wall of the structure. 
D.  Duplexes . Are allowed in locations where their appearance and impact will be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. In this context, duplexes should be designed similar in nature to single dwelling unit houses and shall feature a visible entry and windows facing the street. 
E.  Garages . The intent is to deemphasize garages and driveways as major visual elements along the street, while ensuring that the living area of the residence is more prominent than the garage. Attached residential garages shall be subordinate to the dwelling. 
F.  Manufactured homes . Manufactured homes are permitted on individual lots in the CALR zone in accordance with the placement standards (including foundations) as set forth in this section and other provisions which apply to conventionally built dwellings (i.e. including appropriate building code requirements). The following development standards apply: 
1.  The home must be at least 24 feet by 36 feet. 
2.  The home must be placed on a permanent foundation. 
3.  The home must have a roof of no less than 3:12 pitch. 
4.  The home must have roof and siding materials that are similar in appearance to a site-built residence. 
5.  The home must be new. 
G.  Zero lot lines . A zero lot line development is where houses in a development on a common street frontage are shifted to one side of their lot. This provides for greater usable yard space on each lot. 
1.  Where allowed . Zero lot line developments are allowed for single-family structures in the CALR zone. Zero lot line developments are allowed by right on a minimum of four lots grouped together. 
2.  Setbacks . The side building setback on one side of the house may be reduced to zero. This reduction does not apply to the side building setback adjacent to a street. All other setback requirements apply. 

3.  Privacy wall . In order to maintain privacy, no doors, windows, air conditioning units, or any other types of openings in the walls along a zero lot line structure are allowed except for windows that do not allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot. 
4.  Restrictions . Restrictions which assure the minimum distance between houses, and any required easements, must be recorded on the deeds of the applicable lots. Proof of such recording must be submitted as part of the building permit application. 
5.  Maintenance . An easement between the two property owners to allow for maintenance or repair of the house is required when the eaves or side wall of the house are closer than three feet to the adjacent property line. 
H.  Fences . 
1.  Fences must be set back four feet from the edge of the roadway. Fences over four feet in height must be set back 15 feet from the back of curb parallel to the front property line and seven and one-half feet from the back of curb parallel to the side property line. 
2.  Fences shall be no higher than eight feet. 
3.  The structural support side of the fence shall face towards the interior of the builder's property only on the front and street side yards. 
4.  Fences and hedges must conform to the clear view triangle standards of chapter 21.46. 
I.  Recreational vehicle parks . 
1.  There shall be no more than one per lot and it shall not be placed on a single site for more than 180 days in any 12-month period. 
J.  Nonresidential . The base zone development standards are designed for residential buildings. Generally, different development standards are needed for nonresidential uses which may be allowed in the CALR. The intent of nonresidential standards is to maintain compatibility, and limit potential negative impacts on surrounding residential areas. 
1.  Uses . As indicated in Table 21.17.030-1, nonresidential uses that locate within the CALR zone shall comply with the following development standards: 
Table 21.17.060-2 
Nonresidential Development Standards Standard Nonresidential Building Coverage Ratio Up to 50% Minimum Lot Size 10,000 sf Minimum Lot Width 100' Minimum Lot Depth 100' Minimum Setbacks - Front 30' - Rear and through 20' - Side 10' - Street Side 20' Maximum Height 36' 1 Landscaping Minimum landscape buffering between an institutional use and a residential development is 15'. 1 Utility infrastructure and wireless communication facilities are exempted from the height requirement.  
2.  Specific standards . 
a.  Mechanical equipment . Mechanical equipment located on the ground, such as heating or cooling equipment, pumps, or generators shall be screened from the street and any abutting residential zones by fences, or vegetation. 
b.  Garbage and recycling collection areas . All exterior garbage cans, garbage collection areas, and recycling collection areas must be screened from the street (not located within the front yard setback area) and any adjacent properties. 
c.  Exterior storage . Exterior storage of materials or equipment shall not be visible from the public right-of-way. 
d.  Temporary structures . Temporary structures are permitted if they are connected to the primary use and function of the site or campus. Temporary structures shall not be located in the front yard or street side yard setbacks.

(Ord. No. W-22, § 46, 4-22-2014) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. W-22, § 45, adopted April 22, 2014, repealed in its entirety § 21.20.040, which pertained to conditional uses and derived from Ord. No. U-97, § 116, adopted Jan. 27, 2009; Ord. No. U-59, § 34, adopted in 2008; Ord. No. P-55, § 4, adopted in 1992; Ord. No. O-28, § 1, adopted in 1987; and Ord. No. N-90, § 1(part), adopted in 1986. Subsequently, said ordinance, § 46, reenacted § 21.20.040, as set out herein. 
21.20.050 - Development standards. 
A.  Purpose . Housing types in the low density residential zones are designed to maintain the overall image and character of the Cheney's low density neighborhoods; however, the regulations allow options to increase housing variety and opportunities, and to promote affordable housing. 
B.  Standards . Development standards in the R-1 and R-2 districts are contained in Table 21.20.050-1. These apply to all primary dwellings and accessory buildings on the site. 
Table 21.20.050-1

The rear setback on a corner lot is 15 feet in R-1 and R-2 zones. 
2 Zero feet when it is a zero lot line development. The opposite side yard shall be at least 10'. 
3 Accessory structures shall not be located in the front yard setback, and not be taller than the primary structure. 
4 This is the average building height from finished grade (plane) to the midpoint of the roof, at all exterior walls.  
C.  Lot setbacks . 
1.  Setbacks . The zoning code requires that certain portions of a lot be set aside for front, rear and side yards. In general, no portion of a house (except covered front porches, chimneys, and bay windows) may extend up to 50 percent into these required yards. Eaves may project 30 inches into the required setback. Accessory structures and ADU's may be placed in the side or rear yards (such as garages, sheds, decks, porches or arbors) as along as adequate space is available, and certain criterion are met per CMC 21.44. 

2.  Calculation . Yards are measured from the property line to the wall of the structure. 
D.  Garages . The intent is to deemphasize garages and driveways as major visual elements along the street, while ensuring that the living area of the residence is more prominent than the garage. Attached residential garages shall be subordinate to the dwelling. 
1.  The principal facade of the dwelling is emphasized through the use of architectural features such as, but not limited to, porches, architectural details, height, or orientation, so that the non-garage portion of the residence is visually dominant; 
2.  Garages should not occupy more than 50 percent of the building facade as seen from the front property line. 
E.  Driveways . 
1.  No more than one driveway per dwelling unit; 
2.  Driveways for individual lots 50 feet or wider may be up to 20 feet in width at the throat of the driveway; and 
3.  Driveways for individual lots less than 50 feet wide would be up to 15 feet in width at the throat of the driveway. 
4.  Tandem parking allowed for 2-car garages for single family and duplexes. 
F.  Single-dwelling structures . 
1.  Orientation . If the single-family residence is situated on a corner lot, the structure shall be addressed off of the street that the main pedestrian entrance faces. 
G.  Duplexes . By definition, duplexes are two units that share a common roof and a common wall for at least 50 percent of the maximum depth of the building, and prohibit the separation of the two units by a breezeway, carport, or other open building element; instead of a shared common wall, the two units can share a common floor and ceiling. 
1.  Design standards . Specifically, duplexes shall emulate the look of a single family structure. Duplexes shall use modulated roof forms to help break up the massing of buildings and distinguish individual units. Duplexes on corner lots may be exceptions, where it is often advantageous for a duplex to appear as one home (but with entries on opposite streets). 

H.  Manufactured homes . Manufactured homes are permitted on individual lots in the R-1 or R-2 zone and shall be in accordance with the placement standards (including foundations) as set forth in this section and other provisions which apply to conventionally built dwellings (i.e. including appropriate building code requirements). The following development standards apply: 
1.  The home must be at least 24 feet by 36 feet. 
2.  The home must be placed on a permanent foundation. 
3.  The home must have a roof of no less than 3:12 pitch. 
4.  The home must have roof and siding materials that are similar in appearance to a site-built residence. 
5.  The home must be new. 
6.  Articulation . Include some building articulation through the incorporation of any of the following: 
a.  Change in vertical wall plane (2-foot minimum); 
b.  Change in horizontal wall plane (2-foot minimum); 
c.  Varying roof lines (by emphasizing dormers, chimneys, stepped roofs, and gables); 
d.  Repeating distinctive window patterns; 
e.  Projecting or recessed architectural elements including windows and doors; 
I.  Zero lot lines . A zero (side yard) lot line development is where houses in a development on a common street frontage are shifted to one side of their lot. This provides for greater usable yard space on each lot. 
1.  Where allowed . Zero lot line developments are allowed for single-family structures in the R-1 and R-2 zones. Zero lot line developments are allowed by right on a minimum of four lots grouped together. 
2.  Setbacks . The side building setback on one side of the house may be reduced to zero. This reduction does not apply to the side building setback adjacent to a street. All other setback requirements apply. 

3.  Privacy wall . In order to maintain privacy, no doors, windows, air conditioning units, or any other types of openings in the walls along a zero lot line structure are allowed except for windows that do not allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot. 
4.  Restrictions . Restrictions which assure the minimum distance between houses, and any required easements, must be recorded on the deeds of the applicable lots. Proof of such recording must be submitted as part of the building permit application. 
5.  Maintenance . An easement between the two property owners to allow for maintenance or repair of the house is required when the eaves or side wall of the house are closer than three feet to the adjacent property line. 
J  Fences . 
1.  Fences must be set back four feet from the edge of the roadway. Fences over four feet in height must be set back 15 feet from the back of curb parallel to the front property line and 7.5 feet from the back of curb parallel to the side property line. 
2.  Fences shall be no higher than eight feet. 
3.  The structural support side of the fence shall face towards the interior of the builder's property only on the front and street side yards. 
4.  Fences and hedges must conform to the clear view triangle standards of chapter 21.46. 
K.  Nonresidential . The base zone development standards are designed for residential buildings. Generally, different development standards are needed for nonresidential uses which may be allowed in the R-1 and R-2 zone. The intent of nonresidential standards is to maintain compatibility, and limit potential negative impacts on surrounding residential areas.

3.  Legal lots of record (lots legally created) that do not meet the minimum lot size requirement may be developed with a single dwelling unit. 
C.  Net densities are calculated by averaging lots sizes over an entire development. Individual lots may vary in size provided they do not exceed either the minimum or maximum lot area as identified in Table 21.24.040-1. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 53, 4-22-2014) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. W-22, § 52, adopted April 22-2014, repealed in its entirety § 21.24.040, which pertained to conditional uses and derived from Ord. No. U-97, § 127, adopted Jan. 27, 2009; Ord. No. U-59, s; 36, adopted in 2008; Ord. No. S-46, § 2, adopted in 2001; Ord. No. R-40, §§ 20, 21, adopted in 1988; Ord. No. P-42, § 4, adopted in 1992; and Ord. No. N-90, § 1(part), adopted in 1986. Subsequently, said ordinance, § 53, reenacted § 21.24.040, as set our herein. 
21.24.050 - Development standards. 
A.  Purpose . A range of higher density housing types are allowed in the in the higher-density dwelling zones to maintain the overall image and character of Cheney's higher-density dwelling neighborhoods; however, the regulations allow options to increase housing variety and opportunities, while promoting affordable housing. 
B.  Compliance required . All developments must comply with: 
1.  All of the applicable development standards contained in the underlying zoning district, except where the applicant has obtained a variance(s), CMC Chapters 21.62. 
2.  All other applicable standards and requirements contained in this title. 
C.  Standards . Development standards in the R-3 and R-3H Districts are contained in Table 21.24.050-2. These apply to all primary dwellings and accessory buildings on the site.

2 Rear setback on corner lot. The rear setback on a corner lot is 15 feet in R-3 and R-3H zones. 
3 Zero feet when it is a zero lot line development. The opposite side yard shall be at least 5'or 10', depending on the zone. 
4 This is the average building height from finished grade (plane) to the midpoint of the roof, at all exterior walls.  
D.  Lot setbacks . 
1.  Setbacks . The zoning code requires that certain portions of a lot be set aside for front, rear and side yards. In general, no portion of a house (except covered front porches, chimneys, and bay windows) may extend up to 50 percent into these required yards. Eaves may project 30 inches into the required setback. Accessory structures and ADU's may be placed in the side or rear yards (such as garages, sheds, decks, porches or arbors) as along as adequate space is available, and certain criterion are met per CMC 21.44. 

2.  Calculation . Yards are measured from the property line to the wall of the structure. 
E.  Through lots . Through lots are lots that have frontage on two streets, but not on a corner. Through lots are allowed only where the primary front lot line is on a local service street. The minimum front lot line and minimum width standards apply to one frontage of the through lot. 

F.  Garages (single-family and duplex) . The intent is to deemphasize garages and driveways as major visual elements along the street, while ensuring that the living area of the residence is more prominent than the garage. Attached residential garages shall be subordinate to the dwelling. 
1.  The principal facade of the dwelling is emphasized through the use of architectural features such as, but not limited to, porches, architectural details, height, or orientation, so that the non-garage portion of the residence is visually dominant; 
2.  Garages should not occupy more than 50 percent of the building facade as seen from the front property line. 
G.  Driveways . 
1.  No more than one driveway per dwelling unit; 
2.  Driveways for individual lots 50 feet or wider may be up to 20 feet in width at the throat of the driveway; 
3.  Driveways for individual lots less than 50 feet wide would be up to 15 feet in width at the throat of the driveway; and 
4.  Lots less than 35' wide shall be accessed off of an alley. 
H.  Single-dwelling structures (detached) . 
1.  Orientation . If the single-family residence is situated on a corner lot, the structure shall be addressed off of the street that the main pedestrian entrance faces. 
I.  Single-dwelling structures (attached or townhouse) . 
1.  Building articulation. Repetition of units can be minimized by using the following standards: 
a.  Reversed elevation of two out of four buildings; 
b.  Different building elevations for external units by changing roof line, articulation, windows or modulation patterns; and 
c.  Adding a different dwelling design or different scales. 
2.  Setback variation . If a townhouse development is proposed, no more than two abutting townhouses or townhouse groupings within the townhouse project site shall have a common front building setback. Variations in the setback of front building faces shall be at least 2', for the run of the units. Height variations shall also be incorporated, if feasible, in the townhouse design. 
J.  Duplexes . By definition, duplexes are two units that share a common roof and a common wall for at least 50 percent of the maximum depth of the building, and prohibit the separation of the two units by a breezeway, carport, or other open building element; instead of a shared common wall, the two units can share a common floor and ceiling. 
1.  Design standards. Specifically, duplexes shall emulate the look of a single family structure. Duplexes shall use modulated roof forms to help break up the massing of buildings and distinguish individual units. Duplexes on corner lots may be exceptions, where it is often advantageous for a duplex to appear as one home (but with entries on opposite streets). 

K.  Manufactured homes . Manufactured homes are permitted on individual lots in the R-3 zone and shall be in accordance with the placement standards (including foundations) as set forth in this section and other provisions which apply to conventionally built dwellings (i.e. including appropriate building code requirements). The following development standards apply: 
1.  The home must be at least 24 feet by 36 feet. 
2.  The home must be placed on a permanent foundation. 
3.  The home must have a roof of no less than 3:12 pitch. 
4.  The home must have roof and siding materials that are similar in appearance to a site-built residence. 
5.  The home must be new. 
6.  Articulation . Include some building articulation through the incorporation of any of the following: 
a.  Change in vertical wall plane (2-foot minimum); 
b.  Change in horizontal wall plane (2-foot minimum); 
c.  Varying roof lines (by emphasizing dormers, , chimneys, stepped roofs, and gables); 
d.  Repeating distinctive window patterns; 
e.  Projecting or recessed architectural elements including windows and doors; 
L.  Zero lot lines . A zero (side yard) lot line development is where houses in a development on a common street frontage are shifted to one side of their lot. This provides for greater usable yard space on each lot. 
1.  Where allowed . Zero lot line developments are allowed for single-family structures in the R-3 and R-3H zones. Zero lot line developments are allowed by right on a minimum of four lots grouped together. 
2.  Setbacks . The side building setback on one side of the house may be reduced to zero. This reduction does not apply to the side building setback adjacent to a street. All other setback requirements apply. 

3.  Privacy wall . In order to maintain privacy, no doors, windows, air conditioning units, or any other types of openings in the walls along a zero lot line structure are allowed except for windows that do not allow for visibility into the side yard of the adjacent lot. 
4.  Restrictions . Restrictions which assure the minimum distance between houses, and any required easements, must be recorded on the deeds of the applicable lots. Proof of such recording must be submitted as part of the building permit application. 
5.  Maintenance . An easement between the two property owners to allow for maintenance or repair of the house is required when the eaves or side wall of the house are closer than three feet to the adjacent property line. 
M.  Multi-family dwelling units . 
1.  Use regulations . The use regulations are intended to create and maintain higher density residential neighborhoods. At the same time, they allow for other nonresidential uses but not to such an extent as to sacrifice the overall residential neighborhood image and character. 
2.  Site design . To soften new, more intensive development projects, the preservation of major existing trees within the interior and perimeter of the site is required. 
3.  Screening surface parking . To provide a transition between higher density residential, and lower density residential development. 
a.  Where surface parking lots are adjacent to single-dwelling districts, there shall be a planting strip an average of 10 feet in width (but no less than 8 feet), containing a full screen landscape. Paths are allowed as part of the landscaping strip. 
4.  Reducing the visual impact of a large development . To regulate multifamily development so that it is compatible with the surrounding context of the community. 
a.  Articulation . The maximum building length without articulation/modulation is 30 feet. Articulation shall be achieved through the incorporation of any three of the following: 
1.  Change in vertical wall plane (2-foot minimum); 
2.  Change in horizontal wall plane (2-foot minimum); 
3.  Varying roof lines (by emphasizing dormers, chimneys, stepped roofs, and gables); 
4.  Repeating distinctive window patterns; 
5.  Projecting or recessed architectural elements including windows and doors. 

5.  Pedestrian connections and open space . To provide residents of the development pedestrian access throughout the site and to common open spaces within the development. 
a.  Development projects over five acres in size shall be divided into smaller sub-areas by alleys, lanes, courtyards, passageways, and landscape areas that separate and organize the configuration of buildings. 

6.  Parking concealed . To minimize the visual impact of garages and driveways. 
a.  Garages shall be arranged so that they do not front upon either the public street or the principal access lane through the development. Garages may be accessed from courtyards, secondary lanes, or alleys. 
N.  Fences . 
1.  Fences must be set back four feet from the edge of the roadway. Fences over four feet in height must be set back 15 feet from the back of curb parallel to the front property line and seven and one-half feet from the back of curb parallel to the side property line. 
2.  Fences shall be no higher than eight feet. 
3.  The structural support side of the fence shall face towards the interior of the builder's property only on the front and street side yards. 
4.  Fences and hedges must conform to the clear view triangle standards of chapter 21.46. 
O.  Nonresidential . The base zone development standards are designed for residential buildings. Generally, different development standards are needed for nonresidential uses which may be allowed in the R-3 and R-3H zone. The intent of nonresidential standards is to maintain compatibility, and limit potential negative impacts on surrounding residential areas. 
1.  Uses . As indicated in Table 21.24.050-3, nonresidential uses that locate within the R-3 and R-3H zone shall comply with the following development standards: 
Table 21.24.050-3

CHAPTER 21.26 - MEMBERSHIP LODGING SPECIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT 

21.26.010 - Established. 
    There is established the Membership Lodging Special Overlay District (MLSOD) and the standards and regulations by which certain land uses may be permitted therein. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994) 
21.26.015 - Purpose. 
    This chapter establishes a Membership Lodging Special Overlay District (MLSOD). The purposes of this chapter are: 
(1)  To define the area where a membership lodging can be established; 
(2)  To establish the boundaries of the MLSOD; and 
(3)  To protect the public interest by setting forth standards and procedures required of all groups in the MLSOD. These are identified and described below. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994) 
21.26.020 - Declaration of purpose. 
    The purpose of the MLSOD is to provide within the city a special/designated area for membership lodging. Although special districts have special zoning requirements, the following MLSOD zoning requirements are in addition to the standard zoning requirements approved by city council. All zone classifications underlying the district apply to the MLSOD. But if/when these differ from the special requirements of the MLSOD, the more restrictive requirement(s) will apply. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994; Ord. No. U-97, § 145, 1-27-2009) 
21.26.030 - Permitted use. 
    The following uses are allowed in the MSLOD if they comply with the development standards of this title: 
(1)  All underlying zone uses in accordance with sections 21.25.030, 21.20.030, 21.24.030, 21.28.030 and 21.32.030; 
(2)  Membership lodging quarters as defined in section 21.08.353. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994; Ord. No. U-97, § 146, 1-27-2009) 
21.26.040 - Special requirements for the MLSOD. 
(a)  Minimum lot size. The lot size in the MLSOD for any membership lodging dwelling unit (MLDU) shall be a minimum of 7,000 square feet. 
(b)  Buffering through landscaping and screening. The purpose of these buffering requirements for the MLSOD are to provide a visual separation and sound buffer between any MLDU and any pre-existing adjoining residential lot. Buffering will maximize compatibility between different intensities of land uses by providing visual and sound buffers to separate the areas of intensive use occupied by MLDU's from less intensive use properties. The following landscaping and screening standards shall apply to the MLSOD: 
(1)  Buffering is to consist of sight obscuring evergreens that are no less than four feet above the ground when planted and which will reach a minimum of eight feet within four years of planting. These evergreens will be planted close enough to each other so that they will create a solid barrier within four years. All replacement plants will be six feet or the height of existing plants. 
(2)  These sight-obscuring evergreen buffers are to be provided and maintained by the MLDU and/or by the property owner(s) of an MLDU. Residents and/or property owners shall keep the required planting areas maintained with an automatic sprinkler system and in a manner to serve the original purpose intended. Lack of maintenance shall constitute a violation of this code. 
(3)  Landscaping in all developments located within the MLSOD for aesthetic purposes, shall consist of a mix of evergreen and deciduous plantings including living trees, shrubs and ground covers. Plantings of shrubs and ground covers shall be chosen and spaced to result in a covering of the planting area within three years. 
(4)  A landscaping plan, using an appropriate engineering scale, and showing the following, shall be submitted to the community development director for review and approval for any new construction, any change of use, or any construction resulting in increased occupancy before the issuance of any building permits. All required landscaping shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(A)  Boundaries and dimensions of the site; 
(B)  Common and scientific names for plant materials and size at planting and maturity; 
(C)  Proposed location and quantity of all plant material; 
(D)  Location and identification of all streets, alleys and easements on or abutting the site; 
(E)  Proposed location and dimensions of all on-site buildings; 
(F)  Topographic contours at one-foot intervals. 
(5)  All landscaping within the "clear view triangle" will meet the requirements of chapter 21.46 of the Cheney Municipal Code. 
(6)  Planting areas shall include liberal landscaping using combinations of such materials as trees, ornamental shrubs, gravel, river rock, driftwood, rockeries or lawn, provided that no gravel will be allowed in any area considered to be the front yard. 
(7)  At least ten percent of the parking area shall be devoted to landscaping provided that: 
(A)  Parking and landscaping shall be contiguous unless otherwise approved by the planning commission; 
(B)  Parking lots containing less than 20 parking spaces need provide only perimeter screening and buffering to satisfy the ten percent area requirement; 
(C)  When a parking area abuts residentially zoned property, along any interior property line, plants shall be chosen and spaced so they grow together within three years in a manner sufficient to minimize sound and obscure sight, through the barrier. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum height of four feet at time of planting. 
(8)  An occupancy permit may be issued and installation of all required landscaping may be delayed by order of the building official for a period not to exceed six months when such installation is impracticable by reason of inclement weather; and, provided further, that no such delay shall be granted unless the landscaping contractor or owner furnished the city with a performance bond or other security satisfactory to the city, on condition that such person or persons shall faithfully install the landscaping requirements in accordance with the ordinances of the city and within the time prescribed by the building official. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994; Ord. No. U-97, § 147, 1-27-2009) 
21.26.045 - Modification of landscaping requirements. 
    The planning commission may waive some of the landscaping requirements in the following instances: 
(1)  When application of requirements of this section would result in more than 15 percent of the site area being landscaped. In such case the planning commission may modify those requirements so that not more than 15 percent of the site must be landscaped, providing that the landscaping and corresponding setbacks required are those most beneficial to the public; 
(2)  When the inclusion of significant vegetation located on the site would result in as good as or better satisfaction of the purposes of this section; and 
(3)  When the landscaping would interfere with adequate flow or stormwater runoff, as determined by the Cheney public works director, along drainage easements and/or when the landscaping would interfere with the adequate treatment of stormwater in grassed percolation areas. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994; Ord. No. R-81, § 1, 1999) 
21.26.050 - Setbacks, height and density. 
    Setbacks, height and density requirements for non-membership lodging uses shall adhere to the underlying zone requirements set forth in the respective chapters of the Cheney Municipal Code. Setbacks, height and density requirements for membership lodging are as follows: 
1.  Front setback: 15 feet. 
2.  Corner setback: 15 feet.

21.26.060 - Off-street parking. 
    The purpose of the off-street parking requirements is not only to provide the public and residents of the building with an adequate number of parking spaces, on-site, but also, to provide for vehicular ingress and egress to and from the property from public streets, and for access to the property by emergency vehicles. The intent is to eliminate congestion on public streets, provide for internal on-site vehicular circulation, and allow for controlled access from private property on to a public street. The standards for off-street parking in the membership lodging district are as follows: 
(1)  Off-street parking requirements shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of chapter 21.40 of the Cheney Municipal Code except where amended by this section of the CMC. 
(2)  Off-street parking facilities required under this chapter shall be as follows: Sixty percent of the required parking shall be located on site. Forty percent of the required parking may be provided for through a contractual agreement or real property purchase off site. This off-site location can be either inside the delineated MLSOD boundary or outside the boundary within a distance of 1,200 feet from any directional boundary line of the MLDU site. 
(3)  The number of off-street parking spaces required is three spaces for every four residents of the MLDU. 
(4)  Parking shall be so designed that automobiles shall not back out into public streets. Single-family and duplex residences are exempt. 
(5)  Parking shall only be permitted on the side or rear of the lot. No parking will be allowed to occur in the front yard area where normally there will be lawn or landscaping. 
(6)  All required parking areas will be paved, within six months of approval or one year with proof of action for paving, with a non-permeable surface acceptable to the city's public works director and will be buffered from adjoining properties. 
(7)  Standard vehicle stalls shall not be less than 30 percent of the total required off-street parking spaces. 
(8)  Compact vehicle stalls shall not exceed 70 percent of the total required off-street parking spaces. 
(9)  Any area gained to accommodate compact vehicle stalls shall not be used to increase the number of required off-street parking spaces. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994; Ord. No. R-4, §§ 3-5, 1997; Ord. No. R-81, §§ 2, 3, 1999) 
21.26.070 - Signs. 
    All signage requirements shall be provided in accordance with chapter 21.54 of the Cheney Municipal Code unless otherwise amended by this section of the CMC. The requirements of this chapter are not applicable to any other residential zone. The following types of signs are permitted within the membership lodging overlay district: 
(1)  One sign, not to exceed 40 square feet in area. Such signs may be illuminated and landscaped but shall not be flashing. Such sign may advertise the name or symbol or the membership lodging and cannot exceed five feet in height from ground level; 
(2)  Letters, signifying the symbol of the organization, not to exceed three feet in height and two feet in width may be placed either on the side or front of the structure but not both. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994) 
21.26.080 - Fences. 
    Fences six feet to eight feet in height are permitted along the property lines. Fences of this height are only permitted in the side and rear yards and shall be constructed of wood or be chain linked fencing with sight obscuring slats. No wire or cyclone fences will be allowed. Fences of this height and nature are permitted, not in lieu of but also in addition to landscaping, between membership lodging and residential uses as described in section 21.26.040(1). All other fences will adhere to the underlying zone requirements in accordance with section 21.44.010(2), (3) of the CMC. 
(Ord. No. Q-22, § 2(part), 1994) 
21.26.090 - Site development plan review and approval. 
    Any person or organization intending to alter or remodel a building intended for membership lodging shall submit to the department of community development a site plan during the earliest possible stages of planning before any building permits are issued. A site development plan will show in detail the following information: 
(1)  The exact boundaries and legal description of the property to be developed; 
(2)  All proposed improvements that are to be constructed on the land and their precise locations; 
(3)  The location and dimensions of all off-street parking facilities;

4.  Building facade. One or more similar design characteristics among separate structures shall be provided, including, but not limited to, similar or complimentary building facades, surface materials, colors, landscaping, or signage. 
H.  Design standards related to all zones. 
1.  Building size, bulk, scale, and mass. In an effort to maintain the predominant community character, new buildings or additions should be of similar in size and height of existing structures in the immediate surrounding area. If structures are larger than the predominant character, the structure may be articulated and subdivided proportionally to the mass and scale of other structures on the same block. 
2.  Building orientation. If an entry is oriented to a parking lot, it minimizes pedestrian activity from the street. Orientation and design of all new building or additions shall be reinforced through the observation of the following standards: 
a.  Entrance. Buildings have their primary entrance oriented to their primary frontage or public transit corridor. A building may have a secondary entrance facing any other yard. 
b.  Corner building entrances. Corner building entrances shall be designed in cases where the building is located on a corner lot. 
3.  Pedestrian standards. Design of pedestrian connection could include textured concrete, pavers, or a dedicated pathway.

b.  The side yard setback provisions shall not apply except that all detached structures shall meet the city's adopted building code requirements for type of construction. 
c.  Front yard and rear yard setback requirements in the base zone setback shall not apply to structures on the interior of the project except that any garage facing a street shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the front or side street property line. 
d.  All other provisions of the base zone shall apply except as modified pursuant to this chapter, except for maximum height for which a variance shall be sought, as governed by CMC Chapter 21.60. 
4.  The planning commission can reduce the minimum lot size requirement for attached single family residential uses in planned developments. 
C.  Common open space . In exchange for the approval of higher residential densities, smaller lots and relaxed development standards, the developer of a planned development is required to provide common open space for the active and passive recreational activities of residents and visitors. Such space will be aggregated wherever feasible and shall consist of a combination of landscaped and paved (hard-scaped) areas. Such common open space shall include some combination of the following: plazas, arbors, sitting areas, picnic areas, playing fields and trails to accommodate a variety of active and passive activities and promote visual interest. 
1.  In planned developments, the following requirements shall apply. 
a.  At least 10 percent of the gross area of the site must be devoted to such open space 
b.  Open space . The quality and quantity of public and common open spaces and landscaping provided are consistent with the higher standards of design and amenity required of a PUD. The size, shape, and location of a substantial portion of total public and common open space provided in residential areas render it useable for recreation purposes. 
c.  Open space between all buildings is adequate to allow for light and air, access by firefighting equipment, and for privacy where walls have windows, terraces, or adjacent patios. Open space along the perimeter of the development is sufficient to protect existing and permitted future uses of adjacent property from adverse effects from the development. 
d.  The developer provides open space/common area in excess of the minimum required 15 percent in order to protect critical areas, environmentally sensitive areas, or other significant natural site features. The additional area must represent at least five percent of the gross acreage in order to be eligible for the density bonus. 
e.  Fenced yards associated with buildings immediately adjacent to designated open space and landscaping in parking lots shall not count toward the total requirement. 
f.  Environmentally-constrained land within the planned development, including critical area buffers; may be used to meet up to 50 percent of the total requirement specified in Subsection (a) above, provided that these areas are not fenced and are either accessible to pedestrians to the extent practical or are visually accessible from adjacent and adjoining common open space. 
2.  The common open space designated to meet this requirement shall be permanently maintained by and conveyed to one of the following: 
a.  A homeowners' or property owners' association as regulated by state law. 
b.  Public agency that agrees to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures or improvements placed within it. 
3.  The open space created under this provision is not subject to the park impact fee credit unless so authorized by the Cheney Parks Department. 
D.  Residential density . 
1.  Net developable area calculation . The net developable area of a PUD shall be the gross area of the subject property less critical areas, public/private right-of-ways for streets, and stormwater treatment facilities/tracts. If an existing public right-of-way is already provided, then it is not counted against the net developable area. The calculation of density is rounded down to the next whole number. 
2.  On-site density transfers . An applicant for a planned development may shift allowed residential densities around the site to protect and preserve critical or sensitive areas while providing the overall maximum density permitted by the underlying zoning district. 
3.  Density bonuses . An applicant of a planned development may be entitled to a residential density bonus of five percent above the maximum density allowed in the underlying base zone on the portions of the site devoted to housing. 
4.  Dimensional standards and setbacks . Dimensional standards and street standards may vary in order to achieve clustering and common area design objectives. Such variations shall be justified based on consistency with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan and the purpose and intent of this chapter. Variations shall be documented and become the applicable standards for the subject subdivision. Dimensional standards include building height, setbacks from lot lines and other structures, reduction in the number of parking spaces, and a reduction in lot dimensions. Dimensional standards shall be reviewed by the city. 
5.  Lot depth and width . The minimum lot depth and lot width standards may be modified, except that no lot shall be less than 85 feet deep and less than 20 feet wide. 
6.  Setbacks . See CMC 21.39.080(B)(3). 
E.  Superior design . The PUD represents a more creative approach to the unified planning of development and incorporates a higher standard of integrated design and amenity than could be achieved under otherwise applicable zoning district and subdivision regulations, and solely on this basis modifications to the use and design standards established by such regulations are warranted. 
1.  Meets PUD requirements . The PUD meets the requirements for planned unit developments set forth herein, and no modifications to the use and design standards otherwise applicable are allowed other than those permitted herein. 
2.  Consistent with comprehensive plan . The PUD is generally consistent with the objectives of the city comprehensive plan as viewed in light of any changed conditions since its adoption. 
F.  Public welfare . The PUD will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. 
G.  Compatible with the environment . Neither the PUD nor any portion thereof will be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other properties in its vicinity, seriously impair property values or environmental quality in the neighborhood, nor impede the orderly development of surrounding property. 
1.  Natural features . The design of the PUD is as consistent as practical with the preservation of natural features of the site such as flood plains, wetlands, wooded areas, natural drainage ways, or other critical areas of sensitive or valuable environmental character. This includes features such as on-site facilities providing regional benefits, including drainage control using natural drainage and landscaped drainage retention facilities; flood control measures; innovative water conservation designs such as xeriscaping, storm water storage and reuse for irrigation and gray-water irrigation; and use of recycled materials and resource-conserving design. 
H.  Circulation . Streets, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, bicycle paths, off-street parking, and off-street loading as appropriate to the planned land uses are provided. They are adequate in location, size, capacity, and design to ensure safe and efficient circulation of vehicles and trucks as appropriate without blocking traffic, creating unnecessary pedestrian-vehicular conflict, creating unnecessary through traffic within the PUD, or unduly interfering with the safety or capacity of adjacent streets. 
1.  Connectivity . Connectivity ensures that the street networks of developments and phases of developments connect to existing communities and allow for future connections to adjacent property. These connections will create a more efficient transportation network. New streets must connect to adjacent properties in multiple directions. 
2.  Walk-ability . Increased walk-ability of the project. Walk-ability could include a neighborhood center (i.e. a main street or a public space), detached sidewalks, street trees, small block sizes, narrower streets, complete streets with multi-modal opportunities, fewer cul-de-sacs, provides multiple access connections between development and arterial streets, and access to parks and open space. 
3.  Transportation infrastructure capacity . A traffic study may be required to determine the PUD's impacts on surrounding streets. As a result of the traffic study, additional on-site and off-site traffic mitigation measures may be required. 
I.  Townhouse development . Townhouse development on small lots (less than 4,000 square feet) can often create conflicts with parking, utilities and vehicular access. The applicant will need to eliminate conflicts between the design and location of driveways with public and private utilities, on-street parking and other common features such as street trees, street lights and signs, fire hydrants, common mailboxes, etc.; provide for adequate guest parking; ensure adequate access for solid waste and recycling collection vehicles; minimize the dominance of garages on narrow lots; and provide incentives for lots which utilize alleys for access. 
J.  Off-site and on-site improvements plan . A development plan that demonstrates that utilities, driveways, street trees, etc., have been located and designed to minimize conflicts with one another shall be submitted with the PUD plan and preliminary land division application. 
K.  Parking/driveways . 
1.  Parking small meet the requirements of the underlying zoning or base zoning density, whichever is less restrictive. 
2.  Parking . Common areas reserved for guest parking shall have no more than six parking stalls in each area unless applicant demonstrates required parking cannot otherwise be provided. 
3.  Driveways . Shared driveways serving two adjacent lots shall be no wider than 30 feet, measured at the driveway throat, unless the applicant can demonstrate on the development plan that a wider driveway will not result in conflicts. 
L.  Alley access . Lots with access from rear or side alleys are effective in addressing conflicts at the front street. When provided, alleys and lots served by alleys shall meet the following standards: 
1.  Alleys shall consist of 12 foot minimum paved width (with a 1' shoulder on both sides) within a 20 feet public right-of-way or private easement, and shall be constructed in accordance with approved city standards. Width of alleys designated as fire apparatus access lanes shall be as approved by the fire marshal. 
2.  All lots adjacent to an alley, existing or proposed, shall provide access to the garage or parking space from the alley, not the adjacent street. Residences with access from alleys shall be oriented to face the public or private street, not the alley. 
3.  Alleys shall connect with a public or private street at both ends. 
4.  Maintenance of private alleys shall be the responsibility of the homeowner's association. An approved maintenance agreement shall be recorded with the plat. 
5.  Subdivisions which provide access from alleys to at least 50 percent of lots shall be eligible for a 10 percent density bonus above the underlying zoning. 
6.  For lots which obtain access from a rear alley, decks constructed above the driveway shall not be counted toward the maximum lot coverage of the underlying zoning district. 
M.  Solid waste collection . An access and circulation plan for the collection of solid waste and recycling shall be submitted with PUD plan and preliminary land division application. Where collection is not feasible on each lot, a designated common collection point to serve up to four lots, located no further than 200 feet from any lot it serves, may be provided. Common collection points shall be identified on the solid waste and recycling plan, and sized to accommodate the carts and bins associated with the city's solid waste collection system. 
N.  Setback variation . No more than four abutting townhouses or townhouse clusters within the townhouse project site shall have a common front or rear building setback. Variations in the setback of front or rear building faces shall be at least four feet. 
O.  Building separation . No single grouping or cluster of townhouse units shall exceed 160 feet in length or include no more than eight abutting townhouse units in each cluster. Each cluster/grouping shall be separated from all other groupings of townhouse units by a minimum of ten feet. All building code requirements shall be met. 
P.  Private yard area . Every lot containing a townhouse must provide a private yard of at least 150 square feet, oriented to either the building front, rear or side yard. Each private yard shall be separated visually by fences or walls at least four feet in height or plantings to screen first level views from adjacent units. 
Q.  Engineering . Preliminary civil engineering plans will be required to determine the feasibility of the project in relation to surrounding properties. Plans that will be required initially include stormwater drainage systems, water/sewer systems, typical building footprints, and a tabulation of the percentage of total building coverage in the development. 
R.  Grading . Conceptual grading plans are required for hillside or sloping sites, or sites where extensive grading is anticipated. 
S.  Landscaping . Landscaping is intended to enhance the overall appearance of planned unit developments. The landscaping should improve the residential character, break up large expanses of paved areas and structures, provide privacy to the residents and reduce stormwater runoff. Landscaping and fencing around the perimeter of the PUD shall be designed to act as a transition between the PUD and adjacent properties. Landscaping shall be provided to screen storage areas, trash enclosures, utility boxes, maintenance facilities and similar features from view from the street and adjoining properties. Landscaped areas shall feature drought tolerant and preferably native plant materials. 
T.  Energy efficiency . The developer is encouraged to provide energy efficiency measures that exceed the city's minimum code requirements. This includes features such as preservation of solar access; south orientation with added glazing for inhabited structures; the use of landscaping and topography for windbreaks and shading; common wall construction; the use of active or passive solar energy systems for primary heating and cooling; energy conserving design of roadways and structures; and use of higher insulation levels than would normally be required. 
U.  Lighting . Lighting contributes to the character of the site and should not disturb adjacent development. Lighting should be in scale with surrounding uses and with appropriate shielding, lighting could add safety and ownership to a site, the street or common open space, thus deterring crime. Lighting should not create off-site glare, often caused by lighting in parking areas, building security and general building lighting. All parking area lighting will be designed to incorporate full cut-off type fixtures. Up lighting shall be limited to accent lighting of architectural and landscaping features.

CHAPTER 21.42 - LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING 

21.42.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to require landscaping and screening that produces the quality of development expected by the community, insures compatibility of development with surrounding properties, preserves land values by creating a quality environment and conserves vital natural resources such as drinking water. 
(Ord. No. T-84, § 6(part), 2005) 
21.42.020 - Landscaping required. 
    The standards of this chapter apply to all new construction or substantial remodels except a single-family residence. 
1.  All required landscaping shall be in place before a final certificate of occupancy is issued for any building on the site. If, due to seasonal weather conditions, it is not feasible to install required landscaping, the building(s) may be occupied only after a performance bond or another surety device acceptable to the city, has been posted in the amount of 125 percent of the value of the required landscaping. The landscaping must be installed within six months. Upon completion of the landscaping, the bond or surety device will be released. 
2.  Landscaping must conform to the clear view triangle standards of chapter 21.46. 
3.  Grass swale percolation areas required for the handling of stormwater drainage may be incorporated into the required landscape plantings so long as neither the drainage requirements nor the landscape requirements are compromised. 
4.  In no case do these provisions require more than 15 percent of the site or the equivalent of one-half of the building main floor area, whichever is greater, to be landscaped. 
5.  Landscaping plans for commercial lots and lots with multi-family uses larger than 10,000 square feet shall be prepared on plans stamped by a licensed landscape architect registered in the State of Washington and be submitted at the time of application for other permits. Plans shall include the location, size, and species of all proposed plants. 
6.  The portions of a site not covered by a structure, hard surfaces, or other prescribed landscaping shall be landscaped. 
7.  Street trees (usually one per lot) shall be provided as a part of any long subdivision. 
8.  Landscaping shall be extended on adjoining public right-of-way from the property line of the subject property to the sidewalk, or curb, if no sidewalk is present, and shall include landscaping in the parking strip between the curb and sidewalk if present. 
9.  Site specific landscaping or landscaping on in-fill lots may deviate up to 10 percent from the required landscaping requirements outlined in this chapter per the approval of the Planning Official.

21.42.025 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. W-55, § 18, adopted March. 10, 2015, repealed § 21.42.025, which pertained to minimum perimeter landscaping and derived from Ord. No. T-84, § 6(part), 2005; Ord. No. U-97, § 211, 1-27-2009. 
21.42.040 - Minimum perimeter landscaping. 
    The type of landscaping required is dependent on the zone of the subject property and of the adjoining property, as indicated in the following table: 
Minimum Landscaping Width and Type Location CALR, R-1, R-2 R-3, R3H C-1/MX C-2 I-1 Lot line abutting street 6 ft. of Type III 6 ft. of Type III 6 ft. of Type III* 6 ft. of Type III 6 ft. of Type III Lot line abutting CALR, R-1, R2 None 5 ft. of Type III 5 ft. of Type II* 5 ft. of Type II 5 ft. of Type I Lot line abutting R3, R3H 5 ft. of Type III 5 ft. of Type III 5 ft. of Type III* 5 ft. of Type II 5 ft. of Type I Lot line abutting C-1/MX 5 ft. of Type II 5 ft. of Type II None 5 ft. of Type III 5 ft. of Type II Lot line abutting C-2 5 ft. of Type II 5 ft. of Type II 5 ft. of Type III* 5 ft. of Type III 5 ft. of Type II Lot line abutting I-1, BP 5 ft. of Type I 5 ft. of Type I 5 ft. of Type II* 5 ft. of Type II 5 ft. of Type III *Where buildings are constructed to the front or corner side property line, deciduous street trees in sidewalk planting wells or between the curbs and sidewalks are required in lieu of the six foot planting strip.  
    Note: The owner of adjacent properties may agree to consolidate their perimeter plantings along shared boundaries. Therefore, instead of each property providing a five-foot wide planting strip, they together could provide one five-foot wide planting strip so long as the required type of planting is provided. 
1.  Type I screen. Type I landscaping shall consist of a mix of predominately evergreen plantings, including living trees, shrubs and ground covers. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum height of four feet at the time of planting and be at least six feet in height at maturity. Plant materials shall be chosen and spaced so as to grow together within three years in a manner that is sufficient to totally obscure sight through the barrier. The entire planting strip shall be landscaped. Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape design, provided it contributes to achieving the intent of this section. 
2.  Type II see-through buffer. Type II landscaping shall consist of a mix of evergreen and deciduous plantings including living trees, shrubs and ground covers. Plantings of shrubs and ground coverings shall be chosen and spaced to result in a covering of the landscape strip within three years. Shrubs shall be of a type that do not exceed a height at maturity of approximately four feet. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of 13/4 inches measured at three feet above finished grade at the time of planting and be spaced to result in touching of branches after ten years of normal growth. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of four feet tall at the time of planting and spaced to result in a space between trees approximately equal to the mature spread of the trees being used. Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscape design, provided it contributes to achieving the intent of this section. 
3.  Type III open area landscaping. Type III landscaping shall consist of canopy type deciduous trees or spreading evergreen trees, planted in landscape strips approximately 30 feet on center, with a mix of living evergreen and deciduous ground covers and low shrubs. Shrubs shall be of a type that does not exceed a height at maturity of approximately three feet. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of 13/4 inches measured at three feet above finished grade at the time of planting. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of four feet tall at the time of planting. Existing vegetation may be incorporated into the landscaping design, provided it contributes to achieving the intent of this section. 
(Ord. No. W-55, § 19, 3-10-2015; Ord. No. W-22, § 89, 4-22-2014) 
21.42.070 - Plant material standards. 
A.  Native and naturalized plant species . New landscaping materials shall include species native to eastern Washington or non-invasive naturalized species that have adapted to the climatic conditions of eastern Washington. The selection of plant species should include consideration of soil type and depth, the amount of maintenance required, spacing, exposure to sun and wind, the slope and contours of the site, compatibility with existing native vegetation preserved on the site, water conservation where needed, and the impact of landscaping on visibility of the site for purposes of public safety and surveillance. 
B.  Where there are overhead power lines, the street tree species selected shall be of a type which, at full maturity, will not interfere with the lines; 
C.  Tree standards and guidelines . Unless otherwise noted herein, required trees shall meet the standards outlined in CMC 21.42.040(B) at time of planting: 
1.  If the reviewing authority decides reducing the minimum size of trees will not detract from the desired effect of the trees, the minimum size of trees (other than street trees) may be reduced if the applicant submits a written statement by a licensed Washington landscape architect or Washington-Certified Professional Horticulturist certifying that the reduction in size at planting will not decrease the likelihood the trees will survive. 
D.  Shrub standard . Shrubs, except for ornamental grasses, shall be a minimum of 1-gallon size at the time of planting. 
(Ord. No. W-22, § 90, 4-22-2014; Ord. No. U-97, § 215, 1-27-2009; Ord. No. T-84, § 6(part), 2005) 
21.42.080 - Maintenance. 
    All landscape areas shall be maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
1.  All landscaping shall be maintained with respect to pruning, trimming, mowing, watering, insect control, fertilizing, or other requirements to create a healthy growing condition and attractive appearance and to maintain the purpose of the landscape type. 
2.  Vegetation shall be controlled by pruning, trimming or otherwise so that it will not interfere with the maintenance or repair of any public utility, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or obstruct sight distance at intersections; 
3.  Dead, diseased, stolen, vandalized, or damaged plants shall be replaced within three months with the plants indicated on the approved landscape plan; 
4.  All landscaped areas shall be maintained reasonably free of weeds and trash; and 
5.  All required landscaping that is located within public rights-of-way shall be maintained by the abutting property owner.

CHAPTER 21.67 - ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS 

21.67.010 - Established. 
    There is established the accessory dwelling unit (ADU) and the standards and regulations by which ADUs may be permitted therein. 
(Ord. No. U-59, § 3, 2008) 
21.67.015 - Purpose. 
    An accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is a smaller, subordinate dwelling unit on a lot with, or in, an existing or new single-family residence. These units are intended to provide for a greater range of choices of housing types in single-family and multi-family residential districts. Accessory dwelling units are intended to: 
(1)  Provide for a range of choices of housing in the city; 
(2)  Provide additional dwelling units, thereby increasing densities with minimal cost and disruption to existing neighborhoods; 
(3)  Allow individuals and smaller households to retain large houses as residences; and 
(4)  Enhance options for families by providing opportunities for older or younger relatives to live in proximity while maintaining a degree of privacy. 
(Ord. No. U-59, § 4, 2008; Ord. No. U-97, § 280, 1-27-2009) 
21.67.020 - Applicability. 
    Accessory dwelling units on residential lots. A single-family residence with an accessory dwelling unit is different from a duplex because the intensity of use is less due to the limitations of size and number of bedrooms, and it has the appearance of a single-family structure. An accessory dwelling unit that meets the requirements of this section may be allowed in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3H, SR-2 or CALR zones or on any commercial lot developed with an existing single-family dwelling, except as noted herein. 
(Ord. No. U-59, § 5, 2008; Ord. No. U-97, § 281, 1-27-2009) 
21.67.030 - Development standards. 
(a)  No more than one accessory dwelling unit per legal lot is permitted and it must be accessory to a single-family residence. A lot of record lawfully occupied by two or more single-family residences shall not be permitted to have an accessory dwelling unit. 
(b)  No accessory dwelling unit shall be permitted on a lot of less than 5,000 square feet. 
(c)  Reserved. 
(d)  An accessory dwelling unit may be created through: 
(1)  Internal conversion within an existing dwelling; 
(2)  The addition of new square footage to the existing house or to a garage and any addition thereto is located at least 40 feet back from the front property line; 
(3)  Conversion of an existing garage if the garage is set back at least 40 feet from the front property line; 
(4)  Inclusion in the development plans for, or as part of, the construction of a new single-family detached dwelling unit; or 
(5)  A separate detached dwelling unit on the same lot as the primary dwelling unit when the accessory unit is located at least ten feet behind the most distant back or side wall or other structural element of the primary dwelling unit structure. 
(6)  Mobile homes are not considered an accessory dwelling unit for the purposes of this section. 
(e)  An accessory dwelling unit shall conform to existing zoning requirements for the primary residence, including, but not limited to lot coverage, front, side and rear setbacks, and occupation. 
(f)  Building height is limited to 25 feet for a detached accessory dwelling unit. Building height requirements of the underlying zone do apply to the accessory dwelling unit for internal conversion or structural addition to the existing primary dwelling. 
(g)  Reserved. 
(h)  For purposes of this section, an accessory structure which contains an accessory dwelling unit may not cover more than ten percent of the total site area. 
(i)  The total gross floor area of an accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed 40 percent of the area of the primary dwelling's living area. The living area of the primary unit excludes uninhabitable floor area and garage or other outbuilding square footage whether attached or detached. 
(j)  An accessory dwelling unit shall not contain more than one bedroom. 
(k)  Parking. No minimum on-site parking spaces are required for an accessory dwelling unit in areas with on-street parking available. One parking space is required for the ADU if on-street parking is not available. On-street parking is defined as parking spaces legally available for parking of vehicles. Posted time- or day-restricted parking spaces are not considered as available for purposes of this section. 
(l)  Reserved. 
(m)  The exterior appearance of an addition or detached accessory dwelling unit shall be architecturally compatible with the primary residence. Compatibility includes coordination of architectural style, exterior building materials and colors, roof form and pitch, window style and placement, other architectural features and landscaping. 
(n)  For an accessory dwelling unit created by internal conversion or by an addition to an existing primary dwelling, only one entrance may be located on the front of the house, unless the house contained additional front doors before the conversion. Secondary entrances should be located on the side or rear of the primary residence to the extent possible. 
(o)  An accessory dwelling unit shall not be located in a dwelling or on a lot where a home occupation is operating. 
(p)  An accessory dwelling unit shall connect to public sewer and water. 
(q)  Reserved. 
(r)  Accessory dwelling units shall be subject to impact fees at the same rate as those imposed for multifamily dwelling units. 
(s)  Owner occupancy. Prior to issuance of a building permit establishing an ADU, the applicant shall record as a deed restriction in the county auditor's office a certification by the owner under oath in a form prescribed by the responsible official that one of the dwelling units is and will continue to be occupied by the owner of the property as the owner's principal and permanent residence for as long as the other unit is being rented or otherwise occupied. The owner shall maintain residency for at least six months out of the year, and at no time receive rent for, or otherwise allow to be occupied, the owner-occupied unit if absent for the remainder of the year. Falsely certifying owner occupancy shall be considered a violation of the zoning ordinance and is subject to the enforcement actions described in Title 21. 
(Ord. No. U-59, § 6, 2008; Ord. No. U-97, § 282, 1-27-2009) 
21.67.040 - Design standards. 
(a)  Exterior finish materials. Plain concrete, concrete block, corrugated metal or plywood are prohibited if they are not the predominant exterior finish material on the primary dwelling, unless these materials duplicate or reflect the predominant finish. 
(b)  Roof slopes. For buildings over 15 feet in height, the slope of the accessory dwelling unit roof must be the same as that of the predominant slope of the primary dwelling structure. 
(c)  Historic structures. If an accessory dwelling unit is on the same lot as or within a historic structure which has been designated on the national, state or local historic register, the following design guidelines are applicable: 
(1)  Exterior materials should be of the same type, size and placement as those of the primary dwelling structure. 
(2)  Trim on edges of elements of accessory structures and additions should be the same as those of the primary structure in type, size and placement. 
(3)  Windows in any elevation which faces a street should match those in the primary structure in proportion, i.e., same height, width and orientation (horizontal or vertical). 
(4)  Pediments and dormers. Each accessory dwelling unit over 20 feet in height should have either a roof pediment or dormer if one or the other of these architectural features are present on the primary dwelling.

a.  Allowed activity. An "allowed activity" is a use that due to other regulations or previous reviews is unlikely to result in a critical areas impact. These activities are subject to review by the city, but do not require a separate critical areas review or report. Since these activities are not "exempt," the critical areas standards continue to apply and the underlying permit could be conditioned to ensure that the activity complies with critical areas protection. 
(2)  "Buffer zone" means an area required by this chapter that provides a natural vegetated zone surrounding a natural, restored or newly created critical area which serves as a buffer between the critical area and its associated upland areas and as an integral part of the habitat ecosystem. 
(3)  "Compensation" means replacement by creation, enhancement or restoration of a wetland equivalent in size, function and value to the one being altered or lost due to development. Compensation may also include the use of monetary contributions to a mitigation fund. 
(4)  "Creation" means bringing a wetland or stream corridor into existence at a site in which a wetland or stream corridor did not formerly exist. 
(5)  "Critical areas" means and includes the following ecosystems: areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for drinking water, fish and wildlife habitat, frequently flooded areas, geological hazardous areas and wetlands and streams. 
(6)  "Critical habitat" means habitat necessary for the survival of endangered, threatened, rare, sensitive or monitor species. 
(7)  "Enhancement" means actions performed to improve the condition of existing wetlands or other critical areas so that the functions they provide are of a higher quality.

(28)  "Water typing system" (per WAC 222-16-030/031 or as amended): 
a.  "Type S Water" means all waters, within their bankfull width, as inventoried as "shorelines of the state" under chapter 90.58 RCW and the rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 90.58 RCW including periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands. 
b.  "Type F Water" means segments of natural waters other than Type S Waters, which are within the bankfull widths of defined channels and periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands, or within lakes, ponds, or impoundments having a surface area of 0.5 acre or greater at seasonal low water and which in any case contain fish habitat or are described by one of the following four categories: 
1.  Waters, which are diverted for domestic use by more than ten residential or camping units or by a public accommodation facility licensed to serve more than ten persons, where such diversion is determined by the department to be a valid appropriation of water and the only practical water source for such users. Such waters shall be considered to be Type F water upstream from the point of such diversion for 1,500 feet or until the drainage area is reduced by 50 percent, whichever is less; 
2.  Waters, which are diverted for use by federal, state, tribal or private fish hatcheries. Such waters shall be considered Type F Water upstream from the point of diversion for 1,500 feet, including tributaries if highly significant for protection of downstream water quality. The department may allow additional harvest beyond the requirements of Type F Water designation provided the department determines after a landowner-requested on-site assessment by the department of fish and wildlife, department of ecology, the affected tribes and interested parties that: 
(i)  The management practices proposed by the landowner will adequately protect water quality for the fish hatchery; and 
(ii)  Such additional harvest meets the requirements of the water type designation that would apply in the absence of the hatchery; 
3.  Waters, which are within a federal, state, local, or private campground having more than ten camping units: Provided, that the water shall not be considered to enter a campground until it reaches the boundary of the park lands available for public use and comes within 100 feet of a camping unit, trail or other park improvement; 
4.  Riverine ponds, wall-based channels, and other channel features that are used by fish for off-channel habitat. These areas are critical to the maintenance of optimum survival of fish. This habitat shall be identified based on the following criteria: 
(i)  The site must be connected to a fish habitat stream and accessible during some period of the year; and 
(ii)  The off-channel water must be accessible to fish. 
c.  "Type Np Water" means all segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of defined channels that are perennial nonfish habitat streams. Perennial streams are flowing waters that do not go dry any time of a year of normal rainfall and include the intermittent dry portions of the perennial channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow. 
d.  "Type Ns Water" means all segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of the defined channels that are not Type S, F, or Np Waters. These are seasonal, nonfish habitat streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall and are not located downstream from any stream reach that is a Type Np Water. Ns Waters must be physically connected by an above-ground channel system to Type S, F, or Np Waters. 
(29)  "Wetlands, regulatory," means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency or duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, bogs, marshes and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from non-wetland sites, including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage ditches, grass-lined swales, canals, detention facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds and landscape amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created from non-wetland areas to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

(Ord. No. X-30, § 5, 7-10-2018) 
21.70.065 - Categories of wetlands. 
    The following wetland classification system is adopted for categorizing wetlands for the City of Cheney. Wetlands shall be defined according to the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Eastern Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication # 14-06-030) or as amended. The criteria for the wetland categories are given below: 
(1)  Wetland rating categories. 
(A)  Category I. Category I wetlands are: 1) represent a unique or rare wetland type; or 2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; or 3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or 4) provide a high level of functions. 
We cannot afford the risk of any degradation to these wetlands because their functions and values are too difficult to replace. Generally, these wetlands are not common and make up a small percentage of the wetlands in the region (scores 22-27). 
(B)  Category II. Category II wetlands are difficult, though not impossible, to replace, and provide high levels of some functions. These wetlands occur more commonly than Category I wetlands, but still need a relatively high level of protection (scores 19-21). 
(C)  Category III. Category III wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions and can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project. Wetlands scoring between 16-18 points generally have been disturbed in some ways, and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands. 
(D)  Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest level of functions (scores less than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that we should be able to replace, and in some cases be able to improve. However, experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case. These wetlands may provide some important functions and also need to be protected. 
(2)  Date of wetland rating. Wetland rating categories shall be applied to projects which are submitted on or after the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this section. The wetlands shall be rated as they exist on the date of project application submission, as the wetland naturally changes thereafter, or as the wetland changes in accordance with permitted activities. Wetland rating categories shall not be altered to recognize illegal modifications. 
(Ord. No. X-30, § 6, 7-10-2018; Ord. No. U-59, § 21, 2008; Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.066 - Wetland mapping. 
    The approximate location and extent of wetlands are shown on the adopted critical area maps. The following are additional resources available to indicate the probable location of wetlands and associated soil series: 
(1)  National wetlands inventory maps (NWI); 
(2)  USDA soil conservation county soil survey; and 
(3)  USDA, county hydric soil list. 
(Ord. No. X-30, § 7, 7-10-2018) 
21.70.067 - Wetland boundaries. 
    The exact location of a wetland's boundary shall be determined through the performance of a field investigation by a wetland qualified professional applying the federal wetland delineation manual and regional supplement. This includes the use of professional surveying methods to record delineated wetland boundaries. The presence of wetland area and jurisdictional shoreline areas or associated buffers on a parcel triggers the requirements of this chapter, regardless of whether or not a wetland or buffer is depicted on an official map. 
(Ord. No. X-30, § 8, 7-10-2018) 
21.70.070 - Classes of wildlife conservation areas. 
    The following rating system is hereby adopted as the rating system for classifying wildlife conservation areas for the City of Cheney. 
(1)  Class 1 wildlife conservation area. Class 1 wildlife conservation areas are lands including the following: 
(A)  All seasonal ranges and habitat elements with which federal and state listed endangered, threatened and sensitive species have primary association and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term. 
(B)  Areas targeted for preservation by federal, state and/or local governments which provide fish and wildlife benefits, such as important waterfowl areas identified by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state conservation areas identified by Washington State. 
(2)  Class 2 wildlife conservation areas. Class 2 wildlife conservation areas are all season ranges and habitat elements with which state listed candidate and monitored species or priority game species have a primary association and which, if altered, may produce a likelihood that the species will maintain and reproduce over the long term. 
(3)  Class 3 wildlife conservation areas. Class 3 wildlife conservation areas are habitats which include attributes such as comparatively high wildlife density, high wildlife species richness, significant wildlife breeding habitat, seasonal ranges or movement corridors of limited availability and/or high vulnerability. These habitats may include caves, islands, meadows, mature forests, snag-rich areas, talus slopes and urban natural open space. 
(Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.075 - Additional report requirements-Habitat conservation areas. 
    In addition to the general critical area report requirements, critical area reports for habitat conservation areas must meet the requirements for this section. 
(1)  Prepared by a qualified professional. A critical areas report for a habitat conservation area shall be prepared by a qualified professional who has professional course work and training and has prepared reports for the relevant type of habitat. 
(2)  Area addressed in the critical area report. 
a.  The project area of the proposed activity. 
b.  All habitat conservation area within 200 feet of the project area. 
c.  All shorelines, flood plains, and other critical areas and related buffers within 200 feet of the project area. 
(3)  Habitat assessment. A habitat assessment is an investigation of the project area to evaluate the presence or absence of potential critical wildlife species habitat. A critical area habitat report shall contain the following: 
a.  Detailed description of vegetation on and adjacent to the project area. 
b.  Identification of any species of local importance, priority species, or endangered, threatened, or sensitive species that have primary association with the habitat on or adjacent to the project area, and assessment of potential impacts to the use of the site by the species. 
c.  A discussion of any federal, state, or local special management recommendations. 
d.  A detailed discussion of potential impacts on habitat by the project, including impacts to water quality. 
e.  A discussion of measures including avoidance, minimization and mitigation, proposed to preserve existing habitats in accordance with the following: 
1.  The applicant shall avoid all impacts that degrade the functions and values of a critical area or areas. Unless otherwise provided in this title, if alteration to the critical area is unavoidable, all adverse impacts to or from critical areas and buffers resulting from a developing proposal or alteration shall be mitigated in accordance with an approved critical area report and SEPA documents. 
2.  Mitigation shall be in-kind and on-site, when possible, and sufficient to maintain the functions and values of the critical area, and to prevent risk from a hazard posed by a critical area. 
3.  Mitigation shall not be implemented until after city approval of a critical area report that includes a mitigation plan, and mitigation shall be in accordance with the provisions of the approved critical area report. 
f.  A discussion of ongoing management practices that will protect the habitat after the project site has been developed, including monitoring and maintenance. 
(4)  When appropriate the community development director may request additional information relevant to the habitat characteristics and management of the site. 
(Ord. No. U-97, § 297, 1-27-2009; Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.080 - Habitat performance standards-General requirements. 
(1)  Alterations shall not degrade the functions and values of the habitat. A habitat conservation area may be altered only if the proposed alterations of the habitat or the mitigation proposed do not degrade the functions and values of the habitat. 
(2)  Non-indigenous species shall not be introduced. No non-indigenous plant, wildlife, or fish species shall be introduced into a habitat conservation area unless authorized by a federal or state permit or approval. 
(3)  Mitigation shall attempt to preserve contiguous corridors. Where wildlife corridors exist such as along stream corridors mitigation shall preserve those corridors by appropriate buffer widths. 
(4)  Approvals of activities may be conditioned. The planning commission may condition approval of activities allowed within or adjacent to a habitat conservation area or its buffers, as necessary to minimize or mitigate adverse impacts. 
(5)  Mitigation shall achieve equivalent or greater biological function. Mitigation alterations to habitat conservation areas shall achieve equivalent or greater biological function. Mitigation shall address each function affected by alteration to the habitat. 
(6)  Buffers, establishment of buffers. 
a.  Buffers are required for activities in or adjacent to habitat conservation areas when needed to protect habitat functions and values. Wildlife habitat buffer widths shall reflect the sensitivity of the habitat type and intensity of human activity proposed to be conducted nearby and shall be consistent with recommendations issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Riparian buffer widths shall be established as specified in section 21.70.90 of this chapter. 
b.  The planning commission may allow the recommended habitat area buffer width to be reduced in accordance with a critical areas report, the best available science, and the management recommendations issued by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, only if: 
1.  It will not reduce habitat functions and values. 
2.  It will provide additional resource protection, such as buffer enhancement. 
3.  The total area contained in a buffer area after averaging is no less than the area that would have been contained in the standard buffer. 
4.  Maximum buffer width is not reduced by more than 50 percent in any location. 
(7)  Signs and fencing of habitat conservation areas. The outer perimeter of the habitat conservation area or buffer shall be marked in the field by appropriate temporary markers during construction and if necessary shall be delineated by a permanent marker after completion of the activity at the discretion of the community development director. Fencing may be required at the discretion of the community development director to exclude harmful disturbances such as grazing animals.

21.70.085 - Specific habitats-Performance standards. 
    Wetland habitats. All proposed activities within or adjacent to habitat conservation areas containing wetlands, conform to wetland development performance standards set forth in this chapter. Whichever critical area has the greater protection shall apply. 
(Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.090 - Riparian habitat areas. 
    Riparian habitat areas. Unless otherwise allowed in this title, all structures and activities shall be located outside the riparian habitat area. 
(1)  Riparian habitat areas shall be established for habitats that include aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that mutually benefit each other, and are located adjacent to rivers, perennial, and some intermittent streams. 
(2)  Riparian habitat widths are indicated in the table below. The width shall be measured outward from both sides of the stream from the ordinary high water mark or from the top of the stream bank. 
Stream type Recommended 
RHA Width Type S 250 feet Type F 200 feet Type Np 150 feet Type Ns 50 feet  
(3)  Increased riparian habitat area widths. The recommended riparian habitat area widths shall be increased at the discretion of the planning commission if the recommended width is insufficient to prevent habitat degradation and/or deterioration of riparian functions and values. 
(4)  Riparian habitat mitigation. Mitigation of adverse impacts to riparian habit areas shall result in equivalent functions and values, be located as near the alteration as feasible, and be located in the same sub drainage basin as the habitat impacted. Mitigation requirements shall be the same as outlined in subsection 21.70.075(3)e. Mitigation requirements may be modified at the discretion of the planning commission if it is demonstrated that alternative mitigation measure will result in no net loss of habitat functions and values.

(2)  Measurement of wetland buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the wetland boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the buffer shall be determined according to the wetland category and land use. 
(A)  The planning commission shall require increased buffer widths in accordance of the recommendation of a wetland professional and the best available science on a case-by-case basis when a larger buffer is necessary to protect the wetland function and values. The determination shall be based on one or more of the following criteria: 
(i)  A larger buffer is needed to protect other critical areas; 
(ii)  The buffer or slope of adjacent uplands is greater than 15 percent or is susceptible to erosion that will adversely impact the wetland, or 
(iii)  The buffer has minimal vegetation cover for its habitat class (forested, scrub-shrub, emergent) to ensure the protection of its functions and values. A vegetation planting and enhancement plan may substitute for the increased buffer width if the plan is monitored to ensure success. 
(3)  Increased standard buffer zone width. The planning commission shall require increased standard buffer zone widths on a case-by-case basis when a large buffer is necessary to protect critical area functions and values based on local conditions. Such determination shall be attached as a permit condition and shall demonstrate: 
(A)  A larger buffer is necessary to maintain viable populations of existing species; 
(B)  The wetlands are used by species proposed or listed by the federal government or the state as endangered, threatened, rare, sensitive or being monitored as being critical or having outstanding potential as habitat for those species or has unusual nesting or resting sites; 
(C)  The adjacent land is susceptible to severe erosion and erosion control measures will not effectively prevent adverse wetland impacts; or 
(D)  The adjacent land has minimal vegetative cover or slopes greater than 25 percent. 
(4)  Wetland buffer width averaging. The planning commission may allow modification of the standard wetland buffer width in accordance with an approved critical area report on a case-by-case basis by averaging buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified wetlands professional demonstrates that: 
(A)  It will not reduce wetland functions or values. 
(B)  The wetland has variations in sensitivity due to existing characteristics of slope, soils, and vegetation and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places. 
(C)  The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no less than the area contained in the standard buffer. 
(D)  In no case shall the standard buffer width be reduced by more than 25 percent. 
(E)  Except as otherwise specified in this title, buffers shall be maintained in a natural vegetation cover. 
(5)  Maintenance of buffer zones. Except where otherwise specified, critical area buffer zones shall be retained in their natural condition. Where buffer disturbance has occurred during construction, re-vegetation with approved vegetation shall be required. 
(6)  Permitted uses in a critical area buffer zone. Regulated activities shall not be allowed in a buffer zone except for the following: 
(A)  Activities having minimal adverse impacts on regulated critical areas. These will include low intensity, passive recreational activities, short-term scientific educational activities, trails, conservation, and restoration activities. 
(B)  Stormwater management facilities may only be allowed in the outer 25 percent of Category III and IV wetland buffers, if no other location is feasible and the location of such facilities will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland. 
(7)  A minimum building setback line of 15 feet is required from the edge of any wetland buffer or the setback of the appropriate zone in which the building is located, whichever is greater. The setback shall be identified on the site plan that is filed as part of the application. 
(8)  Signs and demarcation of wetlands. 
(A)  Temporary markers. The outer perimeter of a wetland and buffer shall be marked in the field pursuant to an approved permit so that no unauthorized intrusion into the buffer or wetland occurs prior to and during construction. The marker (stakes, flagging, tape, etc.) shall be at the discretion of the community development director and the director shall inspect the site before construction begins. 
(B)  Permanent signs. As a condition of any permit or authorization issued pursuant to this chapter, the community development director may require the applicant to install permanent signs along the boundary of the wetland or buffer. The design, spacing, and wording of the signs are left to the discretion of the community development director. 
(9)  Buffers on mitigation sites. All mitigation sites shall have buffers consistent with the buffer requirements of this chapter. Wetland buffers shall be based on the expected or target category of the proposed wetland mitigation site. 
(10)  Mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the wetland impacted except: 
(A)  There are no reasonable on-site or sub-basin opportunities or the opportunities have a poor chance of success. 
(B)  Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions and values (including mitigation banking).

21.70.115 - Preservation and protection goals. 
    It is the short-term goal of the ordinance codified in this chapter that there be no "net loss" of the acreage or functional values of all wetlands regulated by this chapter. The long term goal is a "net gain" in functional values. 
(Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.120 - Mitigation. 
    All critical areas restoration, creation and/or enhancement projects required pursuant to this chapter either as a permit condition or as a result of an enforcement action shall follow a mitigation plan prepared by a qualified professional. Wetland mitigation plans shall follow the following Washington Department of Ecology accepted guidance: Wetland Mitigation in Washington State - Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans (Ecology, 2006); and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach (Ecology, 2009) as amended. Riparian and wildlife habitat mitigation plans shall be prepared by a qualified professional using accepted methodologies. The applicant, or violator in the case of an enforcement action, shall receive written approval of the mitigation plan by the planning commission prior to commencement of any critical area mitigation activity. The city will use the following methods of critical areas mitigation in order of preference: 
(1)  The applicant shall avoid all impacts that degrade the functions and values of a critical area. Unless otherwise provided in this title, if alteration to the critical area is unavoidable, all adverse impacts to a critical area and associated buffer resulting from a development proposal shall be mitigated in accordance with an approved critical area report, an approved mitigation plan, and SEPA documents. 
(2)  Mitigation shall be in-kind and on-site, when possible, and sufficient to maintain the functions and values of the critical area. 
(3)  Mitigation shall not be implemented until after the planning commission or designated authority has approved the appropriate critical area report and mitigation plan. 
(4)  Mitigation measures. Mitigation shall achieve equivalent or greater biological and habitat functions as existed in the wetland prior to mitigation. Applicants shall demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been examined with the intent to avoid and minimize impacts to the critical areas. When an alteration to a critical area is proposed, such alteration shall be avoided, minimized, or compensated for in the following order of preference: 
(A)  Avoid impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; 
(B)  Minimize impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action by project redesign, relocation, timing changes, or technological applications; 
(C)  Rectifying the impacts to wetlands, frequently flooded areas, and habitat conservation areas by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment to conditions equal to or higher quality than at the time of initiation of the project; 
(D)  Restoring, replacing, or enhancing the wetland on the site of the project; 
(E)  Restoring, replacing, or enhancing degraded wetlands in the same sub-basin; 
(F)  Creating wetlands on upland sites that were former wetlands, or are disturbed upland sites; 
(G)  Preserving high quality wetlands that are under eminent threat; 
(H)  Reduce or eliminate the impact over time by prevention and maintenance operations during the life of the actions; 
(I)  Compensate for the impact by replacing, enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments; 
(J)  All mitigation efforts will be monitored and remedial action taken if necessary. Mitigation can include a combination of the above measures. 
(5)  Impacts to buffers shall be mitigated at a minimum 1:1 ratio. Compensatory buffer mitigation shall replace those buffer functions lost from development.

(A)  The project area of the proposed activity. 
(B)  All wetlands and buffers within 300 feet (if necessary) of the proposed project area. 
(C)  All shorelines, water features, floodplains, and other critical areas and buffers within 300 feet (if necessary) of the project area. 
(3)  Additional wetland analysis. In addition to the minimum required contents of a critical area report, the wetland report shall address the following site and proposal related information. 
(A)  A written assessment and accompanying maps of the wetlands and buffers adjoining the project area, including the following: 
(i)  Wetland delineation and required buffers; 
(ii)  Existing wetland acreage; 
(iii)  Wetland category, vegetative, faunal, and hydrologic characteristics; 
(iv)  Hydric soil characteristics; and 
(v)  Topographic elevations (as available). 
(Ord. No. X-30, § 15, 7-10-2018; Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.140 - Monitoring program. 
    The mitigation plan shall include a program for monitoring construction, and for assessing a completed project by a critical area specialist. A protocol for the schedule of monitoring and reporting shall be implemented that verify the performance standards are being met. The period of monitoring shall be adequate to verify that the performance goals and objectives are being met and will vary at the discretion of the planning commission. Monitoring would never be less than three years. 
(Ord. No. T-84, § 20, 2005; Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.145 - Contingency plan. 
    The mitigation plan should identify courses of action and remedial measures if the performance standards are not being met. 
(Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.150 - Financial guarantees. 
    The mitigation plan shall include financial guarantees, if necessary, to ensure that the mitigation plan is fully implemented. The requirement of financial guarantees is at the discretion of the planning commission based on the size, complexity, and cost of the mitigation project. If financial guarantees are required they shall be of sufficient funding to ensure mitigation, maintenance, and monitoring. 
(Ord. No. T-84, § 21, 2005; Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.155 - Critical areas markers and signs. 
(a)  The boundary of a critical area will be delineated by survey stakes and tape at the time of the completion of the critical area report. The boundary will be maintained until completion of the project. The required buffer edge will be delineated by plastic tape, or bales, or any other effective marker to prohibit construction activities from encroaching into the critical area or the buffer. 
(b)  Upon completion of the project the boundary of the critical area will be delineated at appropriate intervals by a permanent sign or marker the design of which will be left to the discretion of the planning commission. 
(Ord. No. T-84, § 22, 2005; Ord. No. T-03, § 1(part), 2002) 
21.70.160 - Critical area restoration, creation and enhancement. 
    Under certain circumstances, property owners may be permitted to fill or otherwise alter a wetland if they agree to mitigate or compensate for impacts that occur as a result of a project. Wetland creation and restoration projects are designed to create new wetlands or to restore historical wetlands, while enhancement projects aim to improve existing wetlands or add functions and values. 
(1)  Compensating for wetland impacts. As a condition of any permit allowing alteration of wetlands and/or wetland buffers, or as an enforcement action pursuant to section 21.70.140, the city shall require that the applicant engage in the restoration, creation or enhancement of wetlands and their buffers in order to offset the impacts resulting from the applicant's or violator's actions. The applicant shall develop a plan that provides for land acquisition, construction, maintenance and monitoring of replacement wetlands in terms of acreage, function, geographic location and settings, and that are larger than the original wetlands. The overall goal of any compensatory project shall be no net loss of wetland function and acreage and to strive for a net resource gain in wetlands over present conditions. Compensation shall be completed or approved prior to wetland alteration. 
Compensatory mitigation shall follow an approved mitigation plan pursuant to section 21.70.120 and shall meet minimum performance standards. Given the uncertainties in scientific knowledge and the need for expertise and monitoring, wetland compensatory projects may be permitted only when the city finds that the compensation project is associated with an activity or development otherwise permitted and that the restored, created or enhanced wetland will be as persistent as the wetland it replaces. In addition, applicants shall: 
(A)  Demonstrate sufficient scientific expertise, supervisory capability and financial resources to carry out the project. 
(B)  Demonstrate the capability of monitoring the site and to make corrections during this period if the project fails to meet projected goals. 
(C)  Protect and manage or provide for the protection and management of the compensation area to avoid further development or degradation and to provide for long-term persistence of the compensation area. 
(2)  Wetland restoration and creation. 
(A)  Any person who alters regulated wetlands shall restore or create equivalent areas or greater areas of wetlands than those altered in order to compensate for wetland losses. 
(B)  Compensation areas shall be determined according to function, acreage, type, location, time factors, ability to be self-sustaining and projected success. Wetland functions and values shall be calculated using the best professional judgment of a qualified wetland ecologist using the best available techniques. Multiple compensation projects may be proposed for one project in order to best achieve the goal of no net loss. 
(3)  Acreage replacement ratio. The following ratios shall apply to mitigation that is in kind, on-site, or in the same sub-basin, and has a high probability of success. These ratios do not apply to remedial actions as a result of unauthorized actions. Greater ratios will apply in those cases. These ratios do not apply to the use of credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program, in which the ratios would be consistent with the requirements of the banks certification. Wetland Category definitions are outlined in CMC 21.70.065. 
Category and Type of Wetland Creation or Re-establishment Rehabilitation Enhancement Category I:

(A)  Increased ratio replacement. The city may increase the ratios under the following circumstances: 
(i)  Uncertainty as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation; 
(ii)  A significant period of time will elapse between impact and replication of wetland functions; 
(iii)  Wetland functions; 
(iv)  Projected loss of wetland functional values; 
(v)  The mitigation is outside the sub-basin; 
(vi)  The mitigation is the result of unauthorized or illegal activities; 
(vii)  Off-site compensation. 
(B)  Alternatives mitigation ratios. The planning commission may decrease these ratios under the following circumstances: 
(i)  Findings of special studies coordinated with agencies with expertise which demonstrate that no net loss of wetland function or value is attained under the decreased ratio; 
(ii)  Documented by a qualified wetland specialist demonstrates that the proposed mitigation action will result in a wetland with significantly greater functions and values than the one being impacted; 
(iii)  The proposed mitigation actions have been completed prior to the project and have demonstrated at equivalent functions and values; 
(iv)  In all cases, a minimum acreage replacement ratio of 1:1 is required. 
(v)  There is clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the proposed mitigation site; 
(vi)  A wetland of a different type may be justified based on regional needs or functions and values; the replacement ratios may not be reduced or eliminated unless the reduction results in a preferred environmental alternative; and 
(vii)  The city will consult with agencies with expertise and jurisdiction over the critical areas during the review to assist with analysis and identification of appropriate performance measures that adequately safeguard critical areas. 
(vii)  To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance "Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II" (Ecology Publication #06-06-011a-b, Olympia, WA, March, 2006), the administrator may allow mitigation based on the "credit/debit" method developed by the Department of Ecology in "Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Eastern Washington: Final Report" (Ecology Publication #11-06-015, August 2012, or as revised). 
(4)  Reserved. 
(5)  Location of mitigation. Mitigation actions shall generally be conducted within the same sub-drainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when the applicant can demonstrate that off-site mitigation is ecologically preferable. The following criteria shall be evaluated when determining whether the mitigation proposal is ecologically preferable. When considering off-site mitigation, preference should be given to using alternative mitigation, such as a mitigation bank, an in-lieu-fee program, or advance mitigation. 
(A)  There are no reasonable opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin (e.g., on-site options would require elimination of high-functioning upland habitat), or opportunities on site or within the sub-drainage basin do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts. Considerations should include: anticipated replacement ratios for wetland mitigation, buffer conditions and proposed widths, available water to maintain anticipated hydrogeomorphic classes of wetlands when restored, proposed flood storage capacity, and potential to mitigate riparian fish and wildlife impacts (such as connectivity); 
(B)  On-site mitigation would require elimination of high-quality upland habitat. 
(C)  Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the altered wetland. 
(D)  Off-site locations shall be in the same sub-drainage basin unless: 
(i)  Established watershed goals for water quality, flood storage or conveyance, habitat, or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site; or 
(ii)  Credits from a state-certified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation, and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the certified bank instrument; 
(iii)  Fees are paid to an approved in-lieu fee program to compensate for the impacts. 
(E)  The design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location (i.e., position in the landscape). Therefore, compensatory mitigation should not result in the creation, restoration, or enhancement of an atypical wetland. 
(6)  Credits. Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when: 
(A)  The bank is certified under WAC chapter 173-700; 
(B)  The planning commission determines that the wetland mitigation bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and 
(C)  The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the bank's certification. 
(7)  Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be consistent with replacement ratios specified in the bank's certification. 
(8)  Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the bank's certification. In some cases, the service area of the bank may include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland functions. 
(9)  In-lieu fee mitigation. Credits from an approved in-lieu fee program may be approved for use as compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when: 
(A)  The planning commissions determines that it would provide environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts. 
(B)  The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the approved in-lieu-fee program instrument. 
(C)  Projects using in-lieu-fee credits shall have debits associated with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant's qualified wetland professional using the credit assessment method specified in the approved instrument for the in-lieu-fee program. 
(D)  The impacts are located within the service area specified in the approved in-lieu-fee instrument.

21.70.165 - Enforcement actions. 
    The City of Cheney may bring appropriate actions at law or equity including actions of injunctive relief, to insure that no uses are made of a regulated critical area or their buffers that are inconsistent with this chapter. The City of Cheney may serve upon a person a cease and desist order if the activity being undertaken on regulated critical areas or their buffer is in violation of these rules as described in chapter 21.70.

21.70.175 - Appeals. 
(1)  All decisions rendered by the planning official or designee, regarding this chapter shall be final unless, within 14 days of the written decision, the original applicant or another party of record to the proceedings appeals the decision in writing to the planning commission. 
(2)  All decisions rendered by the hearings examiner regarding this chapter shall be final unless, within 14 days of the written decision, the original applicant or another party of record to the proceedings appeals the decision in writing to the city council. 
(3)  For any appeal under this section, the city shall provide for the record that shall consist of the following:

21.70.185 - Removal of noxious weeds. 
    Many current regulations that protect critical areas do not require a permit for the control and removal of noxious weeds in wetlands and buffers (as well as other critical areas), provided that the control is done by hand or with light equipment and does not involve the use of hazardous substances. Local governments should retain some oversight authority when more extensive control methods are proposed to make sure that wetland functions are adequately protected.

CHAPTER 23.110 - CONCURRENCY DETERMINATION 

23.110.010 - Purpose. 
    To ensure that the proposal does not cause the level of service on a transportation facility to decline below levels of service standards adopted in the City of Cheney's Comprehensive Plan, unless the transportation improvements or strategies to accommodate the new development are made concurrent with the development. "Concurrent" is defined at RCW 36.70A.070(6)(b). 
(Ord. No. W-50, § 26, 10-28-2014; Ord. No. U-99, § 1(23.110.010), 1-27-2009) 
23.110.020 - Approval criteria. 
    The public works director will provide in writing to the planning official, a determination as follows: 
(a)  The streets and local transportation facilities that are subject to concurrency, including the established level of service. 
(b)  Whether the proposal causes the level of service on a transportation facility to decline below adopted levels of service. 
(c)  What transportation improvements or strategies are required of the applicant in order to maintain the level of service on the transportation facility. 
(d)  To implement this section, the public works director may, subject to written approval by the mayor, adopt policies which provide measurement methodologies for level of service standards and concurrency regulations to govern the city's concurrency management system. The policies should set forth the procedures and process to determine whether the transportation facilities have adequate capacity to accommodate the proposed development, the response when capacity is not adequate to accommodate the proposal and capacity allocation procedures. If there is a decrease below the accepted level of service, improvements or strategies should be in place to accommodate the impacts of the development. Strategies may include increased public transportation service, ride sharing programs, and other transportation management strategies. The concurrency management system shall include provisions that demonstrate a project has met the concurrency requirement through the land use approval process or through a separate certificate of concurrency 
(e)  If the established level of service (LOS) cannot be met or appropriately mitigated, then the proposed development shall not be constructed unless RCW 36.70A.070(6)(b) is satisfied. 
(Ord. No. X-31, § 10, 7-10-2018; Ord. No. W-50, § 27, 10-28-2014; Ord. No. U-99, § 1(23.110.020), 1-27-2009) 
23.110.030 - Traffic analysis. 
    The applicant is responsible for the cost of any traffic impact analysis necessary to determine that the traffic forecast to be generated by the development will not cause the level of service on affected transportation facilities to decline below adopted level of service standards. 
(Ord. No. U-99, § 1(23.110.030), 1-27-2009) 
23.110.035 - Appeal. 
    An applicant may appeal a concurrency determination by filing written notice of appeal to the city clerk. Notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of issuance of the concurrency determination. For the purpose of this section, the date on which a concurrency determination is issued is when the applicant is given a copy of the determination or three days after the written determination is mailed to the applicant by regular U.S. Mail to the applicant's last known address, whichever is first. The notice of appeal must specify the grounds of the appeal. The hearing examiner shall hear the evidence and forward a recommendation to the city council for its final decision.
