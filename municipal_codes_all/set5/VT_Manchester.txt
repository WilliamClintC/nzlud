This ordinance establishes the following overlay zoning districts as described herein:

(1)	Design Review Overlay (DRO)
(2)	Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO)
(3)	Aquifer Protection Overlay (APO)

1.1.2	Official Zoning Map

Manchesterโs Official Zoning Map delineates the boundaries of the twelve basic zoning districts. Boundaries of the Flood Hazard Overlay (FHO) are based on FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer map data. Boundaries of the Aquifer Protection Overlay (APO) are based on map data available from the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) online Natural Resource Atlas depicting active source protection areas. Maps delineating the boundaries of the various base and overlay zoning districts established in this section are incorporated by reference into this ordinance and adopted as part of this ordinance.

The Official Zoning Map is on file in the town clerkโs office. Unofficial versions of the maps included in this ordinance and available from the town website are for convenience only. The Official Zoning Map must be used for all measurements and interpretations of the basic district boundaries. FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer map data must be used for all measurements and interpretations of the FHO boundaries. Measurements and interpretations of the APO boundaries must use active source protection area data as provided on the ANR Natural Resources Atlas.

If a specific distance or measurement is not shown on the map, the Zoning Administrator will interpret any Official Zoning Map boundaries indicated as approximately following:

(1)	Streets, railroad lines, power lines or rights-of-way to follow the centerlines of such streets, railroad lines, power lines or rights-of-way.
(2)	Lot lines or municipal boundaries to follow such lines or boundaries.
(3)	Rivers, streams or water bodies to follow the centerlines of such rivers, streams or water bodies. The Zoning Administrator will interpret any of the features listed above to be located where they exist on
 


the ground or as shown on a survey at the time of the interpretation if they vary from their depiction on the Official Zoning Map except that a boundary line adjustment or subdivision that changes the location of a lot line will not change the location of any zoning district boundary indicated as following that lot line.

Section 2	Overlay Districts

2.1	Design Review Overlay District (DRO)

2.1.1	Purpose. The purpose of the Design Review Overlay District is to:

(1)	Preserve, maintain, and enhance the architectural integrity, historic character, quality of design and construction, aesthetics of streetscapes and buildings, and walkability that support Manchesterโs visitor-based economy and the vitality of the town core.
(2)	Preserve, maintain, and enhance the physical qualities of Manchesterโs historic districts by regulating exterior modifications to contributing historic structures and by requiring new structures to be compatible with and respond to their historic setting and context in accordance with the principles summarized below:
(a)	Buildings should function to meet todayโs needs just as they met certain needs at the time they were built. The changes required to meet new demands should be a compromise between the existing integrity of the structure and new functions. Good preservation seeks both of these goals.
(b)	Every attempt should be made to preserve as much of a historic buildingโs original design, architectural details and building materials as is feasible. When it is necessary to introduce modern elements to a historic building exterior, every effort should be made to maintain the buildingโs overall architectural character.
(c)	New construction should be a product of its own time and not be a copy of an older architectural style with associated details no longer practical. The unity of an existing street or block should be a major consideration in the design of any new construction. Rather than copying a particular style, the new building should relate in materials, form, massing, proportion and rhythm of common elements to those present on the street or block.

2.1.2	Applicability. The Design Review Overlay District includes lands in the Downtown (DN), Town Center (TC), Mixed Use 1 (MU1), Mixed Use 2 (MU2), and Mixed Use 3 (MU3) zoning districts, as well as all lands falling in the townโs four historic districts as defined in the Manchester Town Plan.

2.1.3	Allowed Uses. Within this Design Review Overlay District, all land uses and development allowed (permitted or conditional use) in the base zoning district are allowed and require design approval from the Development Review Board or Zoning Administrator, after review and comment by the Design Advisory Committee, and must conform to the standards of this section except for the following:

(1)	Subdivision of land.
(2)	Interior alteration or a change in use that will not result in any exterior modifications.
(3)	Normal repair and maintenance with materials of similar composition, type and appearance.
(a)	This includes any repainting of previously painted surfaces, irrespective of color, but does not include painting of existing, unpainted surfaces.
(b)	For contributing historic structures, normal repair and maintenance must be undertaken
in accordance with the practices recommended in the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings developed by the U.S. Department of Interiorโs Technical Preservation Services.
(4)	Exterior modifications to a noncontributing structure that will not be visible from the street.
(5)	Demolition of a noncontributing structure within a historic district.
(6)	The removal of a sign provided that no evidence of the signโs installation remains.
 


(7)	The replacement of a lawful sign provided that the replacement sign is no larger than the previously approved sign.
(8)	Construction of a freestanding accessory structure with a footprint of no more than 200 square feet in area and a height of no more than 15 feet.
(9)	Non-substantial alterations as determined by the Zoning Administrator.

2.1.4	Dimensional Standards. The dimensional standards within this overlay district will be as specified for the base zoning district.

2.1.5	Design Review Standards. Design review criteria that must be met by land development in this overlay district are found in Section 5.4. All proposed land development within this overlay district must incorporate frontage and facade elements that will contribute to a pedestrian-oriented streetscape, and must be compatible in form, massing, proportion and rhythm with its historic context. More specific, detailed guidance may be found in the Design Guidelines for Manchesterโs Commercial and Historic Districts (as most recently amended and incorporated into this ordinance by reference).

2.3.11  Flood Hazard Area Definitions

The definitions provided in Section 12 apply throughout this ordinance, including to these flood hazard regulations. The definitions provided in this section are specific to these flood hazard regulations and are indicated in italics above.

Development means any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.

Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the initial floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.

Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.

New construction under the flood hazard regulations means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the floodplain management regulation adopted by the community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

Structure means, for regulatory purposes under this bylaw, a walled and roofed building, as well as a manufactured home, and any related built systems, including gas or liquid storage tanks.
 


Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these flood hazard regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3 is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. Agriculture within flood hazard areas not conducted according to required agricultural practices shall constitute a violation of these flood hazard regulations.

4.2	Zoning Permits

4.2.1	Permit Required

Before any land use or development -- including the division of a parcel into two or more parcels or a boundary line adjustment between parcels; the construction, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any building or other structure; or of any mining, excavation or landfill; or any change of use of any building or other structure or land, or any extension of the use of the land -- it is the responsibility of the landowner or person performing such land use or development to obtain a zoning permit from the Zoning Administrator. Exemptions from this requirement are listed in Section 3.3.

4.2.2	Application

An application for a zoning permit may be obtained from the town offices or the town website, and shall  be submitted to the Zoning Administrator along with any fees, maps, plans, or other documents needed to demonstrate conformance with this ordinance.

4.2.3	Pre Application Conference.

A prospective applicant may request a pre-application conference with the Zoning Administrator or  Design Advisory Committee prior to submitting a complete application. A pre-application conference is an informal meeting that provides the prospective applicant with an opportunity to consult with and receive advice in order to save time and expense in the preparation of the application. Any comments or recommendations made are intended to provide general direction to the prospective applicant, but will not be deemed binding in the preparation or review of any subsequent application for development approval.

4.2.4	Assistance.

The Zoning Administrator will assist prospective applicants by:

(1)	Determining whether a project will require one or more types of review under this ordinance.
(2)	Providing applicants with any necessary form to apply for the required types of review.
(3)	Notifying applicants of the applicable fees or other charges that the town may charge in relation to the application or proposed development.
(4)	Providing applicants information about state energy standards for residential or commercial buildings, as applicable.

(2)	If the application is incomplete, inform the applicant in writing of what additional information is required.
(3)	Take no action until all relevant permit fees are paid to the Town of Manchester and until the
application is deemed complete.

4.2.6	Application Requirements.

(1)	The Zoning Administrator may waive an application requirement upon concluding the information is not necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. The Design Advisory Committee or Development Review Board may determine that a waived application requirement is necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance during the development review process and require an applicant to provide the information.
 


(2)	The Zoning Administrator, Design Advisory Committee, or Development Review Board may determine that additional information is necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance during the development review process and require an applicant to provide it.
(3)	The Zoning Administrator must keep written documentation of any application requirement waived or additional material requested and submit that information to the Design Advisory Committee or Development Review Board with the application as applicable.

4.2.7	Time to Act.

Once the Zoning Administrator determines that an application for a zoning permit is complete, the Zoning Administrator must act within 30 days to approve, deny, or refer it to the Development Review Board, except that the time period within which the Zoning Administrator must act will not commence for a zoning permit application that requires:

(1)	One or more types of review under this ordinance until the reviews are complete for the proposed land use or development.
(2)	Notification to a state agency until the agency comments or the comment period elapses,
whichever occurs first.

4.2.8	Deemed Approval

If the Zoning Administrator fails to act with regard to a complete application for a permit within 30 days, whether by issuing a decision or by making a referral to the Development Review Board, a permit shall be deemed issued on the 31st day.

4.2.9	Referral to State

The Zoning Administrator will inform any person applying for a zoning permit that the person should contact the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources Permit Assistance Specialist in order to assure timely action on any related state permits. It remains the applicantโs obligation to identify, apply for, and obtain any relevant state permits.

4.2.10	Permit Takes Effect

A zoning permit takes effect on the 16th day after the Zoning Administrator issues it, provided that no appeal is filed during the previous 15 days or that the applicant has not requested a delay. If an interested person files an appeal, the zoning permit will not take effect until the appeal is decided.

4.2.11	Delay in Effect

Upon request in writing by the applicant, the Zoning Administrator may delay the effective date of a permit and any associated development approvals for no more than 18 months unless the Development Review Board approves a longer delay due to factors beyond the applicantโs control.

For projects that also require Act 250 review, and where an applicant either demonstrates good faith efforts to acquire that permit in a timely manner, or, where an applicant ends up in extended or contested proceedings through no cause or fault of their own, then the timeframe for the local permit will be deemed to commence with the issuance of the Act 250 permit, or in the case of contested proceedings, the timeframe shall commence at the conclusion of such proceedings.

It is not the intent of this section to allow a permittee to have an indefinite or infinite amount of time to proceed with the approved land use or development.
 


4.2.12	Permit Expiration

A zoning permit shall expire after two years, except:

(1)	A permit issued only for installation of signage or change of use shall expire after one year of the date of issuance.
(2)	A permit issued for a boundary line adjustment or subdivision shall expire after 180 days from the date of issuance unless a final plat is recorded in the land records of the town within 180 days. If an applicant lawfully recorded an approved subdivision plat in the Town of Manchesterโs land records, that plat will remain valid and will not expire irrespective of any change in this ordinance.
(3)	The Development Review Board or Zoning Administrator may set a permit expiration date that may differ from the two year timeframe for site- or project-specific reasons.

If the land development permitted by any zoning permit has not been completed, or if the land use permitted has not been commenced by the permit expiration date, then the permit shall expire without further action by the town. If a zoning permit expires before the applicant substantially completes the construction or commences the use authorized by the permit, the applicant must apply for a new zoning permit and any other associated development approvals under this ordinance.

4.2.13	Extensions of Permits

Upon request by a permittee and payment of any required fees, the Zoning Administrator may grant only one extension of up to two years for any permit where neither this ordinance nor external circumstances have changed in ways that would have caused a material change in the outcome of the original application. For administrative permits, any further extensions will require reapplication with payment of the basic administrative permit fee. For permits issued in conformance with Development Review Board approvals, any further extensions shall require application to the Development Review Board with payment of the required basic hearing fee for review of the project for conformance with the regulations in effect at that time. Unless otherwise limited by the Development Review Board for good cause, any extensions granted by the Development Review Board will then start the extension process anew.

4.2.14	Zoning Permits Issued Prior to Amendment or Adoption of these Regulations.

If the Zoning Administrator lawfully issued a zoning permit before the Town of Manchester adopted or amended this ordinance, an applicant will not need a new or amended permit for the project. If such an applicant does not substantially complete the land development or receive an extension before that permit expires, the applicant will need to apply for a new zoning permit, including any development approvals as applicable, under the ordinance as in effect at the time of the new application.

4.2.15	Amending Permits or Approvals

(1)	An applicant may submit a written request for the Zoning Administrator to amend a zoning permit, and any associated development approval, prior to the permitโs expiration. The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed changes to the land development:
(a)	Are minor modifications that conform to all applicable provisions of this ordinance, including the special flood hazard area provisions in Section 2.3;
(b)	Are not material or substantial changes that would have affected the decision on the original
application;
(c)	Do not change the type, character or intensity of the approved land development or use to a greater extent than specified below:
(i)	Any proposed modification must not result in an increased requirement for parking or loading spaces.
(ii)	Any proposed increase in building footprint must not exceed 10% or 500 square feet, whichever is less.
 


(iii)	Any proposed substitution of plant materials must not change the overall landscape design concept.
(2)	The scope of the review will be limited to those aspects of the land development affected by the proposed changes.
(3)	The Zoning Administrator may decline to amend a permit, and any associated development
approval, and refer the request to the Development Review Board.
(4)	The approval of an amendment will not affect the expiration date of the original permit and any associated development approvals.
(5)	The Development Review Board may determine that the proposed amendment would change the approved development to such an extent that it needs to be reviewed as a new application, and may deny the amendment request and require the applicant to apply for a new zoning permit and any associated requirements.

4.2.16	Revoking Permits or Approvals

The Zoning Administrator may take appropriate action to revoke a zoning permit, and any associated development approvals, in accordance with state law if an applicant omitted or misrepresented a material fact on an application or at a hearing.

4.2.17	Transfer of Permit.

Zoning permits and any associated development approvals remain in effect as specified in this ordinance irrespective of any change in ownership of the subject property. All subsequent landowners are subject to the requirements and conditions of any zoning permit and associated development approvals.

Section 6	General Regulations

6.0	Applicability

All land use and development within the Town of Manchester must conform to the standards of this section.

6.1	Access

6.1.1	Applicability. All land being developed must have access from a maintained public or private road in accordance with the provisions of this section. For lots without frontage on a maintained road, also see Section 3.9.3(3). See also Section 6.8 for driveway specifications.

6.1.2	Access Permit. An applicant for development to be served by a new curb cut on a town road or state highway must provide the Zoning Administrator with a copy of an access permit or letter of intent from the town or state for the curb cut as applicable, before the Zoning Administrator may issue a zoning permit.

6.1.3	Public Works Specifications. If there is a conflict between a provision of this section and a provision of the townโs Public Works Specifications, the Public Works Specifications will take precedence.

6.1.4	Curb Cuts. New and modified curb cuts must conform to the following:

(1)	Number. A lot must not be served by more than one curb cut except that:
(a)	The Development Review Board may approve a waiver allowing more than once access on a lot if the applicant can demonstrate that it is necessary to accommodate unique physical conditions on the property, to meet minimum standards for emergency access, or to provide improved traffic circulation within the site.
(b)	The Development Review Board may require a secondary or emergency access for subdivisions or developments when deemed necessary to protect public safety.
(2)	Width. The width of a curb cut as measured at the edge of the street or highway right-of-way
must not exceed the distance specified below, unless otherwise recommended by the Public Works Director (this will include reducing the width of existing nonconforming curb cuts if they are modified):
(a)	12 feet for curb cuts serving single- and two-family dwellings.
(b)	16 feet for curb cuts serving multi-family dwellings.
(c)	20 feet for curb cuts serving non-residential uses not frequently accessed by large trucks.
(d)	24 feet for curb cuts serving non-residential uses frequently accessed by large trucks.
(3)	Sidewalks. Where a sidewalk exists or will be constructed along the frontage, it must continue across the curb cut (this will include replacement of missing sidewalks across existing nonconforming curb curb cuts if they are modified).
(4)	Spacing. New curb cuts must conform to the standards below unless otherwise recommended by
the Public Works Director:
(a)	A new curb cut must be aligned with any existing curb cut on the opposite side of the street whenever feasible, and if not feasible, the centerlines of must be offset by at least 30 feet.
(b)	A new curb cut must be separated from existing curb cuts on the same side of the street by at least 45 feet (as measured from centerline to centerline).
(5)	Cross Access. Applicants proposing to subdivide or develop commercial or industrial lots must
provide a two-way access connection to abutting undeveloped, commercial or industrial lots whenever physically feasible (this will not be interpreted to include abutting lots that are in a residential zoning district). As a condition of site plan approval, the applicant may be required to:
(a)	Fully construct the cross access to the edge of the property;
(b)	Partially construct the cross access to the edge of the property (install the base but not
 


the final surface); or provide an easement and legally binding agreement for construction of the access at a later time (when the access would also be constructed on the abutting property).
(6)	Class 4 Roads and Other Unimproved Rights-of-Way. A Class 4 road or other unimproved
right- of-way is not a maintained road and cannot be used to meet the access requirements of this ordinance. No provision of this ordinance will be interpreted to require the town to maintain a Class 4 road or other unimproved right-of way, or to upgrade a Class 4 road or other unimproved right-of-way to a Class 3 road so that it may serve to provide access to adjoining property. Applicants may propose to upgrade a Class 4 road or other unimproved right-of-way to a Class 3 road at their expense and in accordance with town policies and standards so that it may serve to provide access to proposed land development.

(2)	The applicant must demonstrate that the camping unit conforms to applicable water supply and wastewater disposal standards.
(3)	The camping unit may remain on the lot year-round, but it may only be occupied for a maximum of 180 days total in any calendar year.

6.5	Child Care Facilities

6.5.1	Purpose

This section recognizes community needs for appropriate child care facilities in a variety of settings, by making provision for such facilities throughout the town, pursuant to 24 VSA ยง4412. These regulations are not intended to replace or supersede any applicable state regulations or licensing requirements.

6.5.2	Small Home Child Care

A small home child care refers to a state registered small home-based daycare as defined by the State of Vermont. A small home child care shall be considered by right to constitute a single-family residential use of property. Unregistered or unlicensed child care facilities as defined by the State of Vermont shall also be considered by right as a single-family residential use of property. Therefore, these facilities shall not require a permit and may be located in any zoning district in which single-family residential use is allowed.
 


6.5.3	Family Child Care Home

A family child care home refers to a state licensed home-based daycare for up to 12 children in the residence of the licensee where the licensee is one of the primary caregivers. A family child care home serving up to 12 children shall require a permit issued by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator may require a site plan for a family childcare home. These facilities may be located in any zoning district in which single-family residential use is allowed.

6.5.4	Child Day Care Facility

An early childhood or child day care facility refers to a state licensed daycare not based in a home and is allowed indicated in Section 1.14 (Use Table).

6.5.5	Child Care Facility on an Existing Small Lot

A child care facility may be established as an accessory use to a residential use on an existing small lot, provided the structure in which the facility will operate meets the setback requirements for the district and all applicable provisions of Section 3.9.

6.6	Customary Home Occupation

6.6.1	Constitutes Residential Use.

Pursuant to 24 VSA ยง4412(4), a customary home occupation shall be considered by right to constitute a permitted residential use of property. To qualify as a customary home occupation the business activity must meet the following criteria:

6.8.1	Applicability. New, extended or modified driveways serving proposed development must conform to the standards of this section. A driveway may serve not more than 2 lots.

6.8.2	Public Works Specifications. If there is a conflict between a provision of this section and a provision of the townโs Public Works Specifications, the Public Works Specifications will take precedence.

6.8.2	Technical Review. The Zoning Administrator will forward all applications for new, extended or modified driveways to the Administrative Advisory Group for review and comment. The Development Review Board or Zoning Administrator may condition or deny any approval or permit based on those comments.

6.8.3	Design Standards. Driveways must conform to the standards of Figure 6-1 and the following:

(1)	Angle. Driveways must intersect the road at an angle as close to 90 degrees as feasible given site-specific conditions. Driveways must not intersect the road at an angle of less than 75 degrees if designed for two-way traffic or 60 degrees if designed for one-way traffic.
(2)	Drainage. Driveways must:
(a)	Not block the flow of drainage in gutters or drainage ditches or pipes.
(b)	Not discharge run-off onto the traveled portion of a road.
(c)	Not generate run-off that would unreasonably contribute to an accumulation of stormwater or that would exceed the capacity of downstream facilities or infrastructure.
(d)	Be installed with culverts, where necessary, designed to carry run-off under the driveway.
Such culverts must be sized to convey anticipated peak stormwater flows and be at least 18 inches in diameter, extend at least 2 feet beyond the driveway edges, and installed to minimize erosion damage at the inlet and outlet. It will be the applicantโs responsibility to install and maintain such culverts.

(6)	Stacking lanes and service areas must not be located within minimum required setbacks.
(7)	The message face of any drive-through menu board shall be fully screened from view from any public right-of-way. Drive thru menu boards may be externally illuminated if it is demonstrated that the illuminated features do not cause glare onto adjoining properties or rights-of-way.
(8)	Drive-through facilities must be located a sufficient distance from property lines and screened to prevent adverse impacts, including but not limited to noise and light trespass, on adjacent properties.

6.10	Erosion Control

6.10.1	Purpose. This section is intended to promote construction practices on development and redevelopment sites that limit soil disturbance and compaction, and minimize erosion and sedimentation of downstream surface waters.

6.10.2	Applicability. All construction activities that will disturb soil must implement appropriate measures to prevent erosion and sedimentation from adversely impacting nearby properties, public infrastructure, or downstream surface waters as set forth in the general standards below. Land development that obtains a state construction general or individual permit will be assumed to have met the requirements of this section. Any zoning permit or approval will be conditional upon the applicant submitting a copy of the state permit to the Zoning Administrator prior to the start of construction.
 


6.10.3	Erosion Control Plan Required. Applicants must submit and implement a professionally prepared erosion control plan for construction activities that will disturb more than 10,000 square feet of soil in accordance with the Vermont Standards and Specifications for Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control.

6.10.4	General Standards. All construction activities that will disturb soil must be undertaken in accordance with the following practices (for further guidance see the Vermont Agency of Natural Resourceโs Low Risk Site Handbook for Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control):

(1)	Limit the size of the construction area to the minimum necessary to accommodate the proposed development.
(2)	Preserve significant existing trees within the construction area where feasible. Trees to be preserved within the construction area should be protected by fencing that at a minimum encloses the area around their drip line.
(3)	Mark site boundaries to identify the limits of construction (including storage and access areas) with flags or fencing. No soil disturbance or compaction should occur outside the delineated construction area.
(4)	Limit the amount of soil exposed at one time to reduce the potential for erosion by phasing construction.
(5)	Stabilize and maintain the construction entrance to prevent mud from being tracked onto streets.
(6)	Install silt fences to intercept runoff and allow suspended sediment to settle out on the downslope side of construction activities and between disturbed soil and any drainage feature, stormwater inlet or water body.
(7)	Divert any stormwater from upslope areas around the disturbed area with appropriately stabilized berms or ditches to prevent the runoff from picking up sediment. Untreated stormwater and sediment must not be diverted to neighboring properties, public rights-of-way or water bodies.
(8)	Treat and filter any water pumped out of the construction area before allowing it to flow off the site or to be discharged to a storm drain or water body.
(9)	Slow any concentrated flows of runoff by installing stone check dams in drainage channels.
(10)	Stabilize exposed soil with seed and mulch or erosion control matting promptly when work in an area is complete.
(11)	Monitor the site to ensure that all sediment and erosion control measures are functioning properly. It is particularly important to check erosion control measures just before and after any significant rainfall.
(12)	Periodically clean, replace and maintain all sediment and erosion control measures until vegetation is permanently established on all disturbed areas.
(13)	Till any compacted soil prior to the final seeding and mulching; and
(14)	Stockpile the topsoil removed during construction and spread it back onto disturbed areas prior to the final seeding and mulching. If the quality of the siteโs topsoil is inadequate to support appropriate vegetative cover, it does not need to be stockpiled and it may be replaced with better quality soil or, if it is retained, it should be amended as needed.

6.11	Extraction Operations

6.11.1	New Operations

No topsoil, rock, sand, gravel, or other earth product materials may be removed from any parcel for commercial purposes without site plan and conditional use approval from the Development Review  Board. The Development Review Board may approve such earth products removal, provided it concludes that the following requirements are met:
 


(1)	A site plan must be submitted showing existing grades in the area from which the material is to be removed, together with finished grades at the conclusion of the operation.
(2)	The applicant shall provide for proper drainage of the area during and after completion of the operation.
(3)	Finished grade must not result in a slope steeper than a 2:1 (horizontal-to-vertical) ratio.
(4)	No removal shall take place within 20 feet of a property line, except that where the grade from a property line rises toward the lot where removal is to take place, material lying above the grade at the property line may be removed.
(5)	At the conclusion of the operation, or any substantial portion thereof, the whole area where removal has taken place shall be covered with not less than four inches of topsoil, and seeded with a suitable cover crop.

6.11.2	Existing Operations

Existing sand and gravel, or other extractive operations, must conform to this subsection with respect to any enlargement of the area on which such operations are conducted.

6.11.3	Surety Bond

In accordance with the provisions of 24 VSA ยง4407(8), and before a permit is granted under this section for the removal of soil, sand, or gravel, the applicant shall post a surety bond with the town in an amount and form to guarantee conformity with the provisions of the permit issued hereunder.

6.11.4	Streambed Restrictions

6.12.3	Height. The maximum height of fences and non-retaining walls will be as follows unless otherwise approved by the Development Review Board in order to provide adequate screening or security:

(1)	4 feet if located between the street and the principal building frontline.
(2)	8 feet if located to the rear or side of the principal building.
(3)	10 feet for a fence enclosing a tennis court, in a rear or side yard.
(4)	Height restrictions will not apply to fences within the Office Industrial district provided that:
(a)	The fence does not abut land in another zoning district; and
(b)	The fence height and location does not reduce sight distance at intersections.
(5)	A fence or wall must not obscure vision above a height of 3 feet at an intersection.

6.12.4	Materials. Unless otherwise approved by the Development Review Board, a fence or wall:

(1)	Must be constructed of permanent material such as wood, chain link, stone, rock, concrete, brick, decorative wrought iron or other materials of similar durability;
 


(2)	Must be constructed so that any support posts are to the inside and the โfinishedโ or โgoodโ side faces out; and
(3)	Must not be constructed of barbed wire, razor wire or similar materials capable of inflicting significant physical injury except as required to meet state or federal regulations.

6.12.5	Retaining Walls. Retaining walls must be located and designed as follows:

(1)	No individual retaining wall may exceed 15 feet in height except that pre-existing retaining walls more than 15 feet in height may be repaired and reconstructed to their pre-existing height.
(2)	All retaining walls more than 4 feet in height must be designed by a qualified professional, and must be topped by a fence, hedge or similar barrier. For a system of terraced walls, only the uppermost wall will require a barrier provided that the terraced sections below are not readily accessible from other portions of the property.
(3)	The height of a retaining wall will be measured from the grade at the base of the face of the wall to the grade at the back of the wall immediately above at the location along the wall where those two grades are the furthest apart.
(4)	Terracing of retaining walls is encouraged. To be considered separate walls, two retaining walls must be separated by a horizontal distance of at least 8 feet.

6.13	Frontage Requirement

No land use or development shall be permitted on lots with less than 50 feet of frontage on a public street or private way, unless the provisions of Section 6.13.1 or Section 6.13.2 are meet.

6.13.1	Three or More Lots

The Development Review Board or Zoning Administrator may approve land use or development of three or more lots which do not front on a public street, provided that the following criteria are satisfied:

(1)	A permanent and legally deeded right-of-way not less than 50 feet in width serves each lot;
(2)	No such right-of-way shall be created or transferred if such action will reduce any lot to a size smaller than required in that district; and
(3)	The road serving the lots through this right-of-way shall meet town road standards as established in Chapter 7 of the Manchester Unified Ordinances.

6.13.2	Less Than Three Lots

Where one or two lots are located to the rear of another lot and cannot meet the frontage requirement, the Development Review Board or Zoning Administrator may approve land use or development provided that:

(1)	A permanent and legally deeded right-of-way at least 20 feet in width serves each lot; and
(2)	The area of the lots and the front, side and rear yards for each lot, meet the minimum requirements for that district.

6.14	Grading, Excavation or Fill

6.14.1	Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all grading, excavating or filling of land not exempted in Section 3.3 or associated with an extraction operation as defined under this ordinance and as approved per Section 6.11.

7.1.1	Purpose

The purpose of this section is to ensure appropriate review and oversight of wireless telecommunications towers and associated infrastructure, to protect the scenic, historic, environmental, and residential resources and qualities of the community, and to minimize the visual and environmental impacts of these facilities, all within the confines dictated by federal law.

The provisions of this section shall not prohibit a property ownerโs ability to place or allow placement of antennae used to transmit and receive communications signals on the property ownerโs premises if the aggregate area of the largest face of the antennae is not more than eight square feet, and if the antennae and mast to which they are attached do not extend more than 12 feet above the roof of that portion of the building to which they are attached.

These regulations are consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in that they do not prohibit the provision of wireless telecommunications services, do not discriminate among service providers, and do not pre-empt FCC regulations governing radio frequency emissions.

7.1.2	Review Procedure

Conditional use approval is required for any wireless telecommunications facility that is licensed and regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, along with any associated equipment, buildings, and infrastructure. However, in accordance with 24 VSA ยง4412(9), the Development Review Board shall approve a wireless telecommunications facility that is determined to create either no impact or only de minimus impact upon any criteria in this section of the ordinance. No permit shall be required for a wireless telecommunication facility that is subject to or has received a Certificate of Public Good under 30 VSA ยง248(a).

Prior to granting any approval, the Development Review Board shall make affirmative conclusions upon all of the general conditional use criteria described in Section 5.3 of the ordinance and the criteria described below.

7.1.3	Independent Review

The Development Review Board may engage independent consulting assistance to review the application for conformance with this ordinance and the town plan. Consistent with federal law, the applicant will be required to pay any costs associated with that review. Payment shall be received before the Development Review Board may issue its decision.

7.1.4	Design Review

Applicants are encouraged to locate antennae within existing tall structures such as church steeples or barn silos; in these instances, the standards of this section may be modified or waived by the Development Review Board.

7.1.9	Co-location

The principle of co-location shall be employed to the greatest extent possible. The applicant shall demonstrate that there are no other existing tower sites that can accommodate the proposed facilities. If other sites do exist, then the applicant must demonstrate that they are technically inadequate, or that bona fide, good faith negotiations with that landowner have failed.

Any permit granted shall include a condition requiring that other wireless service providers shall be allowed to co-locate on any new or existing tower. The applicant shall provide written evidence as to how it will comply with this condition, and under what terms co-location will be allowed.

7.1.10	Setback

The minimum setback requirement for any telecommunications tower or associated structure shall be as required in the applicable zoning district, plus an additional setback equal to the height of the tower (the fall zone). The minimum setback for any tower taller than 100' shall be 300' from a dwelling and residential zoning district boundary. Where a tower is mounted on an existing structure such as a barn
 


silo, church steeple, or utility pole, and the tower does not increase the height of the structure more than ten feet, then the additional fall zone setback is not required.

7.1.11	Environmentally Sensitive Areas

The town plan and this ordinance describe environmentally sensitive areas including steep slopes, wetlands, floodways, unique natural features, wildlife habitat, historic sites, high elevations, ridgelines, and scenic resources. A telecommunications facility and associated infrastructure shall avoid undue adverse impacts on these areas to the greatest extent possible. Where there may be adverse impacts, the project shall be designed to mitigate these impacts to the greatest extent possible.

7.1.12	Height

In addition to other standards herein, no tower or structure shall exceed 130 feet in height. No tower or structure may be higher than 10 feet above the average height of buildings within 300 feet of the proposed facility. If there are no nearby buildings, then no tower or structure shall be higher than 10 feet above the average tree canopy height measured in the area of the proposed facility.

7.1.13	Lighting

Towers with lighting shall not be permitted, unless the Development Review Board concludes it the only viable alternative to meet reasonable facility requirements of a communications service provider. The only tower lighting that may be permitted is that required by FCC permit.

7.1.14	Visual Impact

All towers and related infrastructure shall be designed to minimize the visual impact of height and mass. Materials shall be of a type, style, color, and location so as to blend into the site, minimize glare, and not result in undue adverse visual impacts to the natural landscape or the built environment. Disturbance to existing topography or vegetation shall be minimized, unless found necessary to mitigate visual or aesthetic impacts. The location and type of security fencing shall be shown and described on the site plan.

7.1.15	Noise

The Development Review Board may require the applicant provide a study from a qualified engineer as to the maximum projected noise from the proposed facility, measured in dB Ldn (decibels, logarithmic scale, and accounting for greater sensitivity at night). This study shall include existing or ambient  measurements, plus noise that may be created or caused by the proposed facility. Noise measurements and projections shall be provided for the location of the tower facility itself and at the property line.

7.1.16	Site Screening

Screening shall be required at the perimeter of the site, unless it is demonstrated that existing natural foliage is sufficient. Required screening shall be at least ten feet in depth, and at least ten feet tall, with the potential to grow to significant size at maturity.

7.1.17	Access Roads and Above Ground Utilities

Any roads or above ground utilities shall follow the contour of the land, and be sited and constructed to minimize visual impacts to the greatest extent possible.

7.1.18	Monitoring, Maintenance and Compliance

At the request of the Zoning Administrator or Development Review Board, the owner/operator shall provide a report on the status of the facility, including adherence to permit conditions, operations,
 


appearance, structural integrity, safety, noise, screening/landscaping, service roads, utility connections, and compliance with all applicable federal regulations or permit/license conditions.

7.1.19	Abandonment or Discontinuation

At least 30 days prior to abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner/operator shall provide written notice to the town by certified mail of any intent to abandon or discontinue the use of the facility or site. Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the Zoning Administrator or Development Review Board may require the owner/operator to promptly remove all structures and facilities and return the site to predevelopment condition. If there is anticipated reuse by another provider, removal may not be required. If weather prevents prompt restoration of the site, a delay in removal and restoration may occur. In either case, a clear and definitive time frame shall be specified for removal or reuse.

7.1.20	Bonding

As a condition of permit approval and in the case of abandonment or discontinuation of use, the Development Review Board may require a bond or other means of security approved by town counsel to ensure that sufficient funds will be available to remove all structures and restore a site should the owner/operator be unwilling or unable to do so.

(2)	The unit will have a total habitable floor area of 1,200 square feet or less.
(3)	The unit will have access to at least 120 square feet of dedicated, secured, enclosed storage (does not have to be directly accessible from the unit).
(4)	The unit will have direct access to at least 120 square feet of private or semi- private outdoor space such as a porch, deck, balcony, yard or patio.
(5)	The unit will have access to at least 1โ2 acre of common open space suitable for passive outdoor
recreation or a walking trail at least 1โ2 mile in length.

8.1.3	Historic Buildings. Adaptive reuse of a building listed individually, or as a contributing structure within a designated historic district, in the National Register of Historic Places or Vermont Register of Historic Places must preserve the historic character of the building with any exterior modifications being undertaken in accordance with the practices recommended by the U.S. Department of Interiorโs Technical Preservation Services in the Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings.

8.2	Affordable Housing

8.2.1	Purpose

This affordable housing provision is intended to achieve the following:

(1)	Fulfillment of affordable housing goals as established in the town plan;
(2)	Conservation of land and the creation of usable open space and recreation areas;
(3)	Efficient use of town infrastructure and roads; and
(4)	Development that is consistent with the density and character of Manchester while meeting the town's affordable housing goals.

These provisions provide for a degree of flexibility in the design and density of affordable housing projects and financial incentive, through density bonuses, to projects that meet affordable housing needs.

8.2.2	Review Process

An affordable housing project may be permitted as a conditional use, subject to the provisions of Section
5.3 within any district in which multifamily dwellings are allowed.

8.2.3	Design Standards

The following standards shall guide the Development Review Board in its review of an affordable housing project. If any of these standards are not met, and the Development Review Board grants approval of the
 


project, the board shall issue written justification of the rationale for approval despite the failure of the project to meet said standards.

(A)	Outside the Sewer Service Area: If the project does not fall within the sewer service area, the following standards must be met:
(1)	The project shall consist of a minimum of five units.
(2)	The project shall consist of single, two, three, or four family units. Projects involving 10 or more acres may have any mixture of these housing types; however, the following mixture is suggested: at least 25% of the buildings as two-family structures, and at least 25% of the buildings as three- to four-family structures. The types of buildings shall be mixed throughout the development. No such limits apply to parcels smaller than 10 acres in size.
(3)	At least 30% of the parcel shall be retained as open space, and shall be managed by the residents it serves. The intent is to help a project fit into its environment, and to provide a reasonable amount of land for open space and passive or active recreation. While steep slopes or wetlands may serve part of this purpose, all of the open space should not be on such undevelopable land.
(4)	The visibility of dwelling units shall be minimized from public ways or other residential premises through the use of creative building location, grading, screening or planting. Visibility of unsightly abutting land uses from the affordable housing project shall be controlled in the same manner.
(5)	Buildings shall be located at least 50 feet from land used for agriculture in order to minimize the effects of agricultural operations and residential uses upon each other. Natural vegetation shall  be maintained within this 50 foot buffer, where possible, to promote these purposes. Fences shall be erected along such agricultural land to prevent interference with farming practices by children, pets, or any residential activities or uses.

(B)	All Projects: The following standards apply to all affordable housing projects:
(1)	Roads shall be built to town specifications, unless otherwise approved by the Development Review Board upon demonstration of good cause.
(2)	All units may be located on individual lots, on homeowner association owned land, on land owned by organizations whose purposes include the creation and preservation of affordable housing  (i.e., community land trusts), or a combination thereof.
(3)	Site designs shall provide for private outdoor space for each housing unit.
(4)	Consideration shall be given to retaining significant topographic features, to the natural terrain and existing vegetation, and to the project site's relationship with surrounding properties and uses.
(5)	At least one parking space per dwelling is required. All parking shall be located to the side or rear of, or under the buildings, unless the parking area is not visible from the road.

8.2.4	Further Subdivision

No lot shown on a plan for which a permit is granted under this section may be further subdivided, and a notation to this effect shall be shown on the site plan and on the deeds to any such lots.

Subsequent to initial approval of an affordable housing project, the Development Review Board may approve relocation of lot lines within the project. However, any change in overall density, number of affordable housing units, street layout, or open space layout will require further hearings and approval by the Development Review Board.

Prior to issuance of a permit for an affordable housing project that utilizes dimensional waivers or a density bonus, the applicant shall submit to the Zoning Administrator a complete description of the legal and financial mechanisms that will assure perpetual affordability of any affordable housing units. Said
 


legal and financial mechanisms shall be approved by town counsel, and shall become a condition of any approval granted by the Development Review Board for the project.

The Development Review Board shall submit a statement for the public record that describes the manner in which the proposed project does or does not meet the affordable housing needs of the town. This statement shall include a determination of the degree to which application of standard zoning requirements would or would not meet such housing needs.

8.2.5	Determination of Density

The final residential density of the project will be determined by the Development Review Board. The determination will take into account, the base density allowed in the underlying zoning district and the affordable housing needs of the community, as expressed in the Manchester Town Plan or studies assessing housing needs in Manchester.

8.2.6	Affordable Housing Height Bonus

(1)	Outside of the Downtown (DN) and Town Center (TC) districts, an affordable housing structure may be up to 35 feet in height for up to 50% of the footprint of the building.
(2)	Outside of the Downtown (DN) and Town Center (TC) districts, an affordable housing structure may be up to 40 feet in height for provision of at least 50% of the parking under the building.

8.3	Dwelling Units

8.3.1	Applicability. The standards of this section apply to any structure or portion of a structure used or intended to be used as a dwelling unit.

8.3.2	Minimum Unit Size. The minimum size of a dwelling unit must not be less than:

(1)	150 square feet for a studio or efficiency unit (one open living area that includes kitchen, living and sleeping quarters with a separate bathroom);
(2)	220 square feet for a one-bedroom unit; or
(3)	220 square feet plus an additional 70 square feet for each additional bedroom.

8.3.3	Cooking and Sanitation Facilities. All dwelling units must have safe, functioning cooking and sanitation facilities in accordance with the following:

(1)	A dwelling unit must contain permanent bathroom facilities. A bathroom must be a separate room in which there is a toilet, sink, and a shower or bathtub.
(2)	A dwelling unit must contain permanent kitchen facilities. A kitchen must be a room or portion of a room in which there is a sink, refrigerator, and one or more appliances for heating food.
(3)	Any dwelling unit containing 3 or more bedrooms within a multi-family building must have utility
connections for a washing machine and clothes dryer in the unit. Any dwelling unit containing less than 3 bedrooms within a multi- family building must either have utility connections for a washing machine and clothes dryer within the unit or there must be a common laundry room in the building with washing machines and clothes dryers accessible to residents.

8.3.4	Trash Disposal. All multi-family dwelling units must have convenient access to trash and recycling storage areas in accordance with Section 6.22.
 


8.3.5	Open Space. Except for dwelling units located in the Downtown or Town Center districts, all multi-family dwelling units must be located on a lot that includes at least 1โ4 acre or 400 square feet per dwelling unit, whichever is greater, of common open space suitable for passive outdoor recreation.

8.4	Mobile Homes

Mobile homes shall be permitted in any zoning district that permits single-family residences provided that any such mobile home meets the requirements for a single-family residence of the district in which it is located.

No sale of merchandise and no service business shall be carried on within the lot occupied by a mobile home park, except that the Development Review Board may approve the establishment of a self-service laundry or similar service, or the sale of food or household articles to occupants of the mobile home park only, provided that any such use is otherwise permitted in the district in which the mobile home park is located.

8.6	Planned Residential Development

8.6.1	Purpose

The purpose of Planned Residential Development (PRD) is to enable and encourage increased residential density, flexibility of design, and development of tracts of land for single- and multi-family dwellings in clustered groups, to promote the most appropriate use of land, facilitate the economical provision of streets and utilities, and to enhance the environmental quality and rural character of the area through preservation of open space.

8.6.2	Applicability

A PRD is permitted in any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are permitted. In the Rural Residential (RR) and Rural Agricultural (RA) districts, nonconforming lots of at least four acres existing at the time of adoption of this ordinance (XX/XX/2018) are eligible for the residential density bonus with required land protection.

8.6.3	Application Requirements

A PRD shall comply with the requirements of Section 5.2, Site Plan Review, and Section 11, Subdivision Standards.
 


The Development Review Board may waive the requirement for a metes and bounds survey, prepared by a certified land surveyor, if the Planned Residential Development does not involve the subdivision of land. However, if a metes and bounds survey is necessary for an accurate location and description of the building envelopes or easements then the survey shall be required.

The application submission shall include a narrative plan of development that addresses the following:

(1)	How the design provides for the purposes of the Planned Residential Development;
(2)	The proposed number of units and how the design preserves the natural features of the land and site characteristics as identified above;
(3)	The proposed use of the open space lands and proposed mechanisms for its preservation; and
(4)	Requested waivers and bonus densities and justification for granting them.

8.6.4	Review Process

After submission of an application for a Planned Residential Development, the applicant shall have temporary markers placed on the lands in order to enable the Development Review Board to locate readily and appraise the basic layout of the proposed PRD in the field during the site visit. The applicant shall schedule a site visit with the Development Review Board. The purpose of this site visit shall be to confirm the locations of natural features, agricultural uses, and existing structures relative to proposed lot lines, building envelopes, and infrastructure.

Once a site visit has been conducted, the Development Review Board shall hold a preliminary hearing on the proposed PRD. The Development Review Board shall provide a preliminary decision indicating whether the project should move forward for final approval. A final hearing shall be held once the applicant has addressed any concerns enumerated by the Development Review Board in its preliminary decision.

8.6.5	Density

In a Planned Residential Development, the total number of dwelling units shall not exceed the number which could be permitted if the tract were subdivided into lots conforming to the provisions of the district in which such tract is situated, except that a density bonus may be approved by the Development Review Board according to Section 1.15, Dimensional Standards Table, and the following:

(1)	Preservation of Working Lands Use โ Within the Rural Agricultural (RA) District, a density bonus of three dwelling units per ten acres may be awarded to a PRD that results in the preservation of an active farm, or protects agricultural or silvicultural use in perpetuity. At least 70% of the total land area of the project site must be preserved for such use. Appropriate legal restrictions for the perpetual preservation of the agricultural or silvicultural use must be provided.
(2)	Preservation of Open Space โ Within the Rural Residential (RR) District, a density bonus of three dwelling units per five acres may be awarded to a PRD that results in the preservation of open space. At least 50% of the total land area of the project site must be preserved as open space. Appropriate legal protections, restrictions, and maintenance plans must be provided.
(3)	Within the Mixed Use 3 (MU3) District, a 50% density bonus may be awarded to a PRD that results in the preservation of at least 50% of the total land area of the project site. Appropriate legal protections, restrictions, and maintenance plans must be provided.
(4)	Net Zero Density Bonus โ In the Mixed Use 1 (MU1), MU2, MU3, Residential 10 (R10), R4, R1, RR and RA districts, a density bonus may be granted for a PRD that results in all structures meeting net zero energy building standards as defined in this ordinance. The applicant must provide net zero energy building specifications and demonstrate perpetual function of the energy
 


generation systems prior to the close of the DRB subdivision hearing according to Section 5.5.7 and Section 5.9.
(5)	Utilization of Under-Building Parking โ A density bonus may be granted for a PRD with underground or under-building parking. Such bonus will be determined by the Development Review Board, based on site constraints and the percentage of underground parking that is proposed.

The number of bonus units granted shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

8.6.6	Legal Restrictions and Requirements

(1)	Dedication of Open Space. Land to be preserved as open space in Planned Residential Developments may be offered for dedication to the town for park and conservation purposes. If such land is not so offered, or if the town declines to accept the offer, it shall be dedicated to a community association or other entity, as herein provided.
(2)	Working Land Restrictions. Land to be preserved as working lands for agricultural or silvicultural use must be protected for such use by dedication of development rights and protection of these working lands uses in perpetuity.
(3)	Community Association Required. The applicant shall organize under the laws of the State of
Vermont a non-profit community association, corporation, or cooperative, to be composed of all present and future owners of lots within the PRD. Such non-profit community association, corporation, or cooperative shall be responsible for management and maintenance of all common open space or other common elements of the development. The applicant shall submit a set of deed restrictions or covenants that run with the land and shall record the same in the Manchester land records.
(4)	No Community Association Required. In the case of Planned Residential Developments in which all land designated as open space is dedicated to, and accepted by, the town, and there are not common water, sewer, or other commonly owned elements, the organization of a community association shall not be required.

8.7	Workforce Housing

8.7.1	Purpose. The purpose of this section is to encourage the development of housing that meets the needs of the townโs workforce.

8.7.2	Workforce Housing Height Bonus

(1)	Outside of the Downtown (DN) and Town Center (TC) districts, a workforce housing structure may be up to 35 feet in height for up to 50% of the footprint of the building.
(2)	Outside of the Downtown (DN) and Town Center (TC) districts, a workforce housing structure
may be up to 40 feet in height for provision of at least 50% of the parking under the building.
 


Section 9	Site Design Standards

9.1	Purpose

The purpose of this section is to establish site development standards to protect the quality of life by preventing land use and development from creating or contributing to adverse off-site impacts.

9.2	Applicability

Applicants must obtain site plan approval from the Development Review Board before the Zoning Administrator may issue a zoning permit for any land development other than one- or two-family dwellings and accessory uses or structures to one- or two-family dwellings.

9.3	Performance Standards

Applicants seeking site plan approval must demonstrate that proposed land development conforms to the site plan standards put forth in this section.

9.3.1	Noise. Unless otherwise approved by the Development Review Board, noise emanating off site must not be distinct from the background sound level beyond the property line, and must not interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of other properties. If proposed land use and development is deemed likely to have noise impacts, the Development Review Board may:

(1)	Require the applicant to submit an acoustical analysis of sound generation on the site prepared by a qualified professional.
(2)	Require acoustical site design strategies, and acoustical architectural design strategies to manage noise generated on the site.

9.3.2	Glare. Lighting must not be used or directed in such a manner that it produces glare on roads, on nearby property, or in the windows of nearby buildings.

(1)	All exterior lighting must meet the standards put forth in Section 9.5.
(2)	If proposed land use and development is deemed likely to produce glare or excessive skyglow, the Development Review Board may require a photometric analysis plotting the footcandle distribution on the site for all proposed outdoor lighting.

9.3.3	Odors. Emission of odors that are readily detectable without special instruments at any point beyond the property line and that interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of other properties is prohibited.

9.3.4	Vibration. Vibration that is easily discernible without special instruments at any point beyond the property line is prohibited except that:

(1)	This will not apply to vibration caused by motor vehicle, train, or aircraft traffic.
(2)	The Development Review Board may approve greater vibration levels for a specified period, frequency and purpose.

9.3.5	Electrical or Radio Interference. Creating interference with electrical or radio apparatus beyond the property line is prohibited.
 


9.3.6	Waste Storage. Storage of wastes that attract insects or rodents, or otherwise create a health hazard is prohibited. All waste must be stored in tightly sealed storage containers or within a fully enclosed building unless specifically approved otherwise by the Development Review Board. Solid waste removal must occur on a regular basis to prevent accumulation. Waste receptacles must be appropriate screened from public view per Section 6.22.

9.3.7	Air Quality. The project must not result in undue impacts on air quality. Generation of dust, dirt, fly ash, smoke, particulate matter or other airborne solids that accumulate at any point beyond the property line or that interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of other properties is prohibited except when related to approved construction activities. Consideration of air quality shall include types and quantity of air emissions, odors or hazardous substances, and dust control.

9.3.8	Hazardous Substances. Flammable, combustible or explosive materials must be stored and handled in conformance with state and federal regulations. Such materials must be securely stored within a fully enclosed building or tank. Proposed land use and development must not release toxic or hazardous substances or wastes into the environment or cause contamination of any potable water supply, sanitary sewer or septic system, watercourse or water body, soil or air except as specifically permitted by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.

9.3.9	Water Quality. The project must not result in water pollution. Consideration shall include the nature of soils and subsoils, slope, proximity to streams, aquifer recharge areas and groundwater, floodplains, stormwater runoff, and drainage. The project should provide for protection of the natural terrain, shoreline protection, retention of vegetation, and erosion control.

9.3.10	Scenic and Natural Beauty. The project shall not have an undue adverse effect on the scenic or natural beauty of the area, natural landscape, or rare and irreplaceable natural areas. Consideration shall be given to the retention of significant topographic features of the site, and the relationship to surrounding properties and the effects on ridgeline resources.

9.3.11	Historic Sites. For land use and development involving historic sites, the project shall not have an undue adverse effect on historic sites. The applicant may be required to retain the services of a professional with expertise in historic preservation to satisfy this standard. Consideration shall be given to external design of buildings and related site improvements, as well as signs, exterior lighting, overall site design, and historic features. Materials and design details shall take into account harmony and proportion and adjacent land use. Buildings which are included in the Vermont Historic Sites and Structures Survey shall be retained for their historic contribution. It is the intent of this standard to avoid destruction of historic properties or buildings unless it is clearly demonstrated by the applicant that there can be no reasonable use of the property without destruction of the building.

9.3.12	Transportation Safety. The project shall not cause unreasonable congestion or unsafe conditions with respect to the use of transportation facilities existing or proposed. Consideration shall be given to vehicular and pedestrian movement, parking, design and layout of streets and driveways, intersections, grades and profiles, adjoining land uses, sight distances, trip generation and road capacity, turning movements, peak traffic flows, and surface treatment. In connection with any application to change an existing use, consideration shall only be given to impacts of the proposed new use that differ from the impacts associated with the existing use. Additional traffic studies may be requested of the applicant if necessary to satisfy the above considerations.

9.3.13	Energy Conservation. The project shall reflect principles of energy conservation and incorporate the best available technology that is economically justified. Consideration may be given to location and
 


orientation of structures and other project infrastructure, surrounding land uses, energy and utility  sources, the length and placement of utility lines or other utility infrastructure, heating, cooling and lighting technologies employed, landscape design and features, or any other project features that the Development Review Board concludes appropriate to energy conservation.

9.3.14	Impervious Cover. Paved areas shall be only as large as necessary to serve parking, circulation, and improved open space needs, and their appearance will be enhanced by landscaping. No parking   area shall run continuously for more than 80 feet along a front street line, or for more than 150 feet along any street line. A pedestrian walkway shall be provided within each parking area to connect such area  with buildings, public sidewalks, and adjoining land development. Parking areas shall be set back at least 10 feet from side and rear lot lines except for allowances for shared parking and access.

9.3.15	Residential Buffers.

(1)	To protect existing abutting one- and two-family uses from proposed commercial and multifamily development, and where undue adverse impacts may reasonably be anticipated, either of the following shall be the base levelโ requirement, whichever is greater:
(a)	An additional 5 feet of setback shall be provided between commercial and multifamily residential buildings and adjoining single family residential property lines, above the minimum setback otherwise required in the district, for each 5,000 square feet of building footprint above that otherwise permitted in the district or corridor;
(b)	No part of a building may break the plane drawn at a 45 degree angle sloping inward and upward from any shared property line on the ground that adjoins residential lands or uses (see illustration below).

 



(2)	Once the setback point or line is established, further consideration shall be given to site-specific mitigation, needs, or circumstances that may prevent adverse impacts with less setback. The final determination of required setback made by the Development Review Board shall thus include  both the quantitative element of distance, as well as circumstances such as slope, natural and built topography, density and intensity of plantings, fencing, and other mitigating factors.
(3)	For commercial developments that abut residential zoning districts, greenspace shall be designed and installed to diminish commercial impacts upon the residential zone. This greenspace shall define, soften, and screen the commercial use. Existing mature trees (deciduous trees of 6" diameter or greater at breast height; conifers 12' tall or greater) shall be preserved in place, relocated on-site, or replaced with trees of equivalent size and species.
 


(4)	The Development Review Board may grant Greenspace reductions when a development project provides exceptional landscape enhancements as described in this section.
(5)	Exceptions to these requirements shall be made only in the case of essential services to provide appropriate, separation or screening for these larger buildings or uses, but not to require so much separation or screening as to effectively preclude a use that is otherwise permissible.

9.4	Landscaping

9.4.1	Intent. The provisions of this section are intended to:

(1)	Enhance the appearance of the built environment as viewed from public vantage points;
(2)	Provide shade and reduce heat and glare, particularly along sidewalks and walkways, and within parking lots;
(3)	Control soil erosion and stormwater runoff;
(4)	Screen potentially incompatible land uses and utilitarian site features;
(5)	Calm traffic, and improve pedestrian safety and comfort; and
(6)	Preserve existing mature vegetation and naturally vegetated buffers to the maximum extent feasible.

9.4.2	Applicability. Proposed development subject to site plan approval, including planned unit developments, must provide landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this section.

9.4.3	General Standards. All landscaping required under this ordinance must conform to the following:

(1)	Landscape Plan. Applicants for site plan approval must submit a landscape plan prepared by a licensed landscape architect or a certified horticulturist when landscaping will be altered or installed.

(2)	Plant Materials. Plant materials must meet the specifications in Figure 9-1 and the following:
(a)	The Town of Manchester strongly encourages use of native species and prohibits use of invasive species as identified by the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.
(b)	For reasons of health, vigor, and longevity, only nursery-grown plant materials may be
installed to meet the standards of this section.
(c)	All plantings must be planted according to accepted horticultural standards.
(d)	Species chosen must be appropriate to their specific planting location (trees or shrubs planted close to a road or parking area should be salt- tolerant, for example).

(3)	Design Principles. Landscaping must be an integral element of project design, especially as related to parking lot screening, the fit of the building within the natural and built environments (both on-site and as related to adjoining sites), and pedestrian access and circulation, (both within the site and as connected to adjoining sites or other paths or sidewalks) and must be designed in accordance with the following:
(a)	Clustered plantings of substantial trees must be provided in order to enhance the
aesthetic appearance of a site. Except for street trees, individual trees or plantings shall not appear at rigid intervals.
(b)	Substantial deciduous trees with wide canopies mixed with conifers, shrubs and ornamental plants must be provided to create significant shade, screening, and aesthetic improvement. Single-species hedges (such as arbor vitae) must be used for accent or as a backdrop only, and not as primary landscaping elements.
 


(c)	Densely planted, well-maintained flower beds are strongly encouraged as an aesthetic enhancement to landscaping plans.
(d)	Where pedestrian paths are provided, landscaping such as raised planters, trees, or other features must be used to reinforce the identification and use of these paths.

(1)	Performance Bond. If landscaping cannot be installed at an appropriate stage in the  construction due to time of year or unusual weather conditions, the Development Review Board may allow the applicant to install the landscaping within a reasonable time frame. The applicant must submit a performance bond in accordance with Section 4.4.4 to ensure that landscaping will be installed in accordance with the approved plans. The performance bond will be held until the landscaping is completed.

(2)	Maintenance. Landscaping required under this section or as a condition of approval must be maintained in a healthy condition. Dead or dying plants must be replaced within 1 growing season with a comparable plant (in terms of type, form, size at maturity, etc.) of at least the minimum size requirements specified in Figure 9-1.

(3)	Inspection. The Development Review Board may require that the Zoning Administrator inspect the site to determine that the plant materials are healthy and that the landscaping is functioning as intended after several growing seasons as a condition of approval. An inspection is recommended when landscaping is integral to ensuring that the proposed development performs as approved (such as within green stormwater infrastructure or riparian buffers, or where there is a specific screening or aesthetic concern, for example).

9.6.5	Shared or Off-Site Parking. The Development Review Board may approve a cooperative parking plan to allow parking to be shared by two or more uses or to be provided off-site in accordance with the following:

(1)	Calculate the total amount of shared parking required by:
(a)	Determining the minimum parking requirements for each use as if it were a separate use in accordance with Section 9.6.4 above.
(b)	Multiply each amount by the corresponding percentages for each of the five time periods set forth in Figure 9-4. The Zoning Administrator will establish percentages for any unlisted use.
(c)	Calculate the total for each time period.
(d)	Select the highest total as the required minimum number of shared parking spaces.
(2)	Any shared or off-site parking must be located within 1,000 feet of the associated use (as measured along the sidewalk) unless shuttle service is provided. The parking area and buildings served must be connected by a sidewalk or pedestrian walkway.
 


(3)	The applicant must record a written agreement between the owners and lessees, executed for a minimum of 20 years, in the townโs land records. Should the use(s), parties involved, or terms of the agreement change in a manner that would alter the amount of parking provided or required, the agreement will need to be revised, re-approved and re-recorded in accordance with this section. Should the agreement expire or otherwise terminate, the use(s) for which the shared or off-site parking was provided will be considered in violation of this ordinance unless replacement parking is provided in accordance with this section.
(4)	The applicant must submit plans showing the location of the use(s) or structure(s) for which shared or off-site parking will be provided, the location of the parking, and the schedule of times used by those sharing the parking.

9.6.6	Payment in Lieu of Parking. The Development Review Board may approve a payment in lieu of parking for some or all of the required on-site parking for proposed land development within the town core in accordance with the following:

(1)	The applicant must make the full payment in lieu of parking to the town prior to the Zoning Administrator issuing a certificate of compliance for the associated development.
(2)	The fee will be proportional to the number of parking spaces that would otherwise be required, and will be based upon reasonable cost estimates for the provision of that parking.
(3)	The site plan approval will specify the amount of parking credited as part of the rights attached to the subject property for current and future uses.

9.6.7	Location Standards. Off-street parking and loading areas must be located as follows:

(1)	Required parking and loading areas must be located on the same lot as the use or structure they serve unless a cooperative parking plan is approved in accordance with Section 9.6.5 above or a payment in lieu of parking is made in accordance with Section 9.6.6 above.
(2)	Parking and loading must only occur on those portions of the lot indicated for such use on the approved site plan.
(3)	Required parking and loading areas (inclusive of vehicle overhang) must be located on the lot in accordance with the following:
(a)	Parking areas must meet the setback requirements specified in Figure 1-1. Shared parking areas may be located within a common side or rear setback provided that a cooperative parking plan is approved in accordance with Section 9.6.5 above.
(b)	Parking areas must not be located within minimum required front setback; and in the  town core, parking is prohibited between the street and the building frontline. This will not be interpreted to prohibit parking of registered, operable motor vehicles within a residential driveway.
(c)	Except within the Office Industrial District, loading areas must be located to the side or rear of building they serve.

9.6.8	Dimensional Standards. Off-street parking and loading areas must conform to the following:

(b)	Serving tractor-trailer trucks must have an overhead clearance of at least 14 feet and must be not less than 12 feet wide and 60 feet long, exclusive of access and maneuvering area.
(4)	Turnarounds. All off-street parking and loading areas must be designed so that vehicles can enter and exit the property without backing out onto a street except for parking that serves a single-family or two-family home and that does not require backing out onto an arterial street.

9.6.9	Design, Construction and Maintenance Standards. Off-street parking and loading areas must conform to the following:

(1)	Surface. Off-street parking and loading areas must provide a firm, level surface appropriate for the anticipated level of use in all seasons. Parking areas for more than 10 vehicles, drive-through lanes and loading areas must be surfaced with asphalt or concrete. The Development Review Board may modify the surfacing requirements to accommodate green stormwater management practices.
(2)	Layout. Perpendicular (90 degree) parking is required unless the applicant demonstrates that
due to site-specific conditions angled parking will allow for more efficient site design and compact development footprint. The Development Review Board may modify the dimensional requirements for angled parking spaces and associated aisles as recommended by the Department of Public Works.
(3)	Erosion and Drainage. Off-street parking and loading areas must be surfaced, graded, drained
and maintained to properly treat all stormwater and minimize erosion in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.10 and Section 6.18. Run-off or eroded surface materials must not flow onto adjacent streets or properties.
(4)	Markings. Parking areas for other than one- or two-family use must demarcate the parking

(6)	Landscaping. Off-street parking areas must be landscaped in accordance with Section 9.4. The amount of landscaping required will be reduced from 1.0 equivalent planting unit (EPU) per 5 parking spaces to 1.0 EPU per 10 parking spaces for rear parking lots that will be screened from view at the street by buildings.
(7)	Snow Removal. Snow storage areas must be shown on the site plan in accordance with the
following:
(a)	Applicants must demonstrate that adequate area is available on the site for snow storage or, if an adequate area does not exist, that snow will be removed from the site.
(b)	Snow must not be stored within required vegetated buffers or stormwater infrastructure unless those features are specifically designed for that purpose.
(c)	If the parking area has more parking spaces than the minimum required for the use under this section, snow may be stored on the excess spaces.
 


(8)	Accessible Parking. Land development must provide accessible parking in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations. Accessible spaces will count towards the minimum parking required under this section.
(9)	Electric Vehicle Charging. Electric vehicle charging stations may be provided within off-street parking areas as an allowed accessory use in any zoning district. Additional parking will not be required when parking spaces are converted or reserved for charging vehicles and such spaces will count towards the minimum parking required under this section.
(10)	Bus or RV Parking. The Development Review Board may modify the dimensional requirements
for bus or RV parking as recommended by the Department of Public Works.
(11)	Maintenance. Parking and loading areas must be maintained in good condition, free of weeds, dust, trash and debris, and appropriately surfaced and graded to prevent erosion, sedimentation and runoff.

Section 10	Sign Regulations

10.1	Purpose

The purpose of this section is to help preserve and improve the existing attractive aspects of the Manchester environment, to promote the welfare, convenience and safety of its inhabitants and visitors, to conserve the value of property, and to encourage a style and scale of outdoor advertising that is compatible with a tourist-oriented economy and the more attractive features of the Manchester townscape. This section recognizes the necessity of signs to inform the travelling public and as an aid to local businesses in attracting customers. It also recognizes that neither the travelling public nor local businesses are well served by unlimited signage.

10.2	Administration and Interpretation

Before the alteration, construction, or installation of any sign, a zoning permit shall be secured from the Zoning Administrator, except as otherwise provided in this ordinance.

10.2.1	Development Review Board Approval Required

All new freestanding signs on multitenant commercial properties, drive thru menu boards, exterior ATMs, gasoline price signs, and vending kiosks, shall require approval by the Development Review Board as part of the site plan review process as set forth in this ordinance. All other signs are eligible for administrative review.

10.2.2	Design Review Required

Before the alteration, construction, enlargement or installation of any sign within the Design Review Overlay District, approval through the following process shall be secured prior to the issuance of a permit by the Zoning Administrator. The Design Advisory Committee shall review the proposed signage and make a recommendation to the Development Review Board or Zoning Administrator. Through the design review process, the Design Advisory Committee, Development Review Board, and Zoning Administrator shall consider size, location, design, color, texture, lighting, and materials of all exterior signs within their purview.

10.2.3	Administrative Review

Temporary signs and signs not falling in a design review district, shall be subject to administrative review only. The Zoning Administrator may act on an application for a minor modification to an already approved sign within the Design Review Overlay District without consultation from the Design Advisory Committee. A minor modification shall include only:

(a)	A change in business name or logo on the sign retaining the same size, font style, and material.
(b)	A change in location of the sign.

10.2.4	No Permit required

The replacement, repair, or repainting of a damaged or worn sign with one of the same construction, size, color, material and design shall not require a permit.

10.2.5	Size

The size of any sign shall be determined by the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblems, or physical structure of the sign, whichever is largest. However, the calculated area of a freestanding sign
 


does not include its posts and cornices. Where two or more zoning districts co-exist, such as with overlay districts, the underlying district determines the allowable size. The size of signs composed of stenciling or lettering shall be determined measuring the area of an imaginary polygon drawn around the outside edge of all letters or emblems as if it were a single sign.

10.3	Freestanding Signs

10.3.1	Number

(A)	One freestanding sign, pedestal, or post-supported, is allowed per lot. The only exceptions are temporary signs as allowed by provisions in Section 10.8; where a lot has at least 650 feet of frontage on a town or state road, an additional freestanding sign is allowed provided the two signs will be at least 350 feet apart; or where the lot is located within the Town Center District, and has at least 300'  of frontage along a single major street from which vehicular access is gained. In the third case, an additional freestanding sign may be permitted for each additional 300' of road frontage or partial increment thereof on that single major street, under the following conditions:
(1)	Additional signs must be placed at separate, existing driveways accessing the lot from that single major street;
(2)	No business name, nor aspect of any business or establishment, may be listed or advertised on
more than one freestanding sign on a lot;
(3)	Each additional freestanding sign as described herein, shall be limited to 16 square feet.
(B)	For a parcel without frontage on a public road that is served by a legally deeded right-of-way through a parcel with such frontage, said right-of-way shall be considered as part of the premises for purposes of an allowable freestanding sign. However, any such sign must be shared with the front parcel.

This sign shall be no larger than the largest sign otherwise allowed in that particular location in town. To maximize the effectiveness of this sign, consideration should be given to a single place name rather than simply a list of land uses.

This provision is limited to those lots which do not have frontage on a public road; i.e., those uses on rear lots where the otherwise allowed sign would not be visible to the traveling public. This provision shall not be interpreted to interfere with the rights of the underlying landowners (over whose land the right-of-way traverses) to have their own separate sign under this ordinance. This section shall not be interpreted to increase the number or size of freestanding signs allowed on any parcel or lot.

10.3.2	Dimensions and Location

Freestanding signs shall only have two sides, which are parallel to each other, and no more than six inches apart. The maximum allowable size of freestanding signs in the DN, TC, MU1, MU2, MU3, and OI districts is 16 square feet. In the TC, MU3, and OI districts a maximum size of 32 square feet may be allowed with conditional use approval by the Development Review Board. Unless otherwise regulated in this ordinance, freestanding signs in the R10, R4, R1, RR, RA, and FC districts shall be no larger than eight square feet.

The size of posts and cornices shall be proportional with the size of the sign.

Where there are more than eight commercial tenants in separate and unaffiliated ownership on a single lot, up to two square feet of additional sign is permitted for each tenant in excess of eight, up to a maximum size of 24 square feet (this does not apply if there is more than one freestanding sign as allowed in subsection 10.3.1.1). Such additional freestanding sign in excess of 16 square feet shall be
 


designed so that it is easily removed, and the size of the sign thus decreased, should any or all of the additional tenants cease to exist on the lot.

The bottom of a freestanding sign shall not restrict the visibility of vehicles entering or leaving any intersection or driveway, town or state highway, or private road. Maximum allowable height is ten feet, measured from grade level to the top of the sign or any part of its structure.

Freestanding signs and their associated support structures shall be set back at least three feet from the inner edge of sidewalks; where sidewalks do not exist, the setback shall be at least seven feet from the traveled way or edge of pavement of the street or highway.

10.4	Flush-Mounted Signs

10.4.1	Number

If there is no freestanding sign on the lot, then two flush-mounted signs per establishment are allowed on the building where the advertised activity exists. If there is a freestanding sign on the lot, then each establishment is allowed one flush-mounted sign on the building where the advertised activity exists.

In addition, one three square foot flush-mounted sign may be permitted at the rear entrance of each establishment on a lot, provided that:

(1)	The rear entrance is a direct access from a rear parking lot which is located in the rear yard as defined in this ordinance;
(2)	The rear entrance is in addition to a front or side entrance;
(3)	The sign is not illuminated in any manner; and
(4)	The sign is mounted directly above, on, or beside the rear door to the establishment which it advertises.

10.4.2	Dimensions and Location

The maximum allowable size of flush-mounted signs in the DN, TC, MU1, MU2, MU3, and OI districts is 16 square feet. Unless otherwise regulated in this ordinance, flush-mounted signs in the R10, R4, R1, RR, RA, and FC districts shall be no larger than eight square feet. Where mounted on a wall, these signs shall protrude no more than six inches from the wall.

Flush-mounted signs shall be mounted in locations that fit with the architectural design of buildings, such as over entrance doors.

10.5	Projecting Signs

Projecting signs may be substituted for allowable flush-mounted signs on a one-for-one basis. These signs shall not exceed eight square feet in size, and shall not extend further than three feet away from the building. For safety reasons, the lowest part of the sign or its support structures shall be at least eight feet above the sidewalk or grade directly beneath the sign.

10.6	Soffit Signs

Where a covered walkway exists on a building with multiple tenants in separate and unaffiliated ownership, each tenant may have one sign which is hung from the soffit not to exceed two square feet. This sign shall not be illuminated, shall be hung in front of the entrance to the business which it advertises, and hung in a direction perpendicular to the walkway so that it is legible to pedestrians on the
 


walkway. For safety reasons, the lowest part of the sign or its support structures shall be at least eight  feet above the sidewalk or grade directly beneath it. Soffit signs are permitted in addition to any other sign allowed by this ordinance.

10.7	Lighting

Lighting on any sign shall be directed and shielded so that the light shines only on the subject sign, and to prevent glare offsite, into the sky, or onto adjoining properties or roads and highways. All bulbs shall be shielded or hooded. All ground-mounted fixtures shall be screened by bushes or other appropriate  means. All fixtures mounted on the sign itself shall blend in with its background color or its surroundings, as deemed appropriate for the site.

Lighting on any sign shall be limited to a total of 150 watts of incandescent light, 40 watts LED, or the equivalent, unless otherwise authorized for unique site- or sign-specific reasons. No sign may be internally illuminated, except in the case of an exterior ATM or external vending kiosk, if such illumination is specifically approved as part of the site plan and design review process.

Where a sign or its lighting fixtures are being replaced or substantially altered, lighting shall be brought up to these standards. Applicants must demonstrate that lighting fixtures will satisfy these standards, and are appropriate for site-specific needs and circumstances. Internally illuminated signs existing on the date of adoption of this provision (January 6, 1997) may remain as-is, even if minor changes to such signs (such as changing business names or sign faceplates) are proposed. However, more significant changes to these signs (such as changes in location, or to the physical size or structure) will require complete compliance with the ordinance in effect at the time of the application for change.

The Zoning Administrator may require the adjustment or relocation of any sign lighting in order to prevent glare and to ensure vehicular and pedestrian safety.

10.8	Special Categories of Signs

10.8.1	Residential Signs

11.3.2	Land subject to periodic flooding, poor drainage, inadequate capability to support development, or other hazardous conditions must not be subdivided unless the applicant can demonstrate that appropriate measures will be taken to overcome the physical limitations.

11.4	Design and Configuration of Parcel Boundaries

11.4.1  Lot Arrangement. The applicant must design the subdivision:

(1)	To follow and extend the planned settlement pattern (including lot size, lot configuration, road layout and building location) as defined by the purpose and standards of the applicable zoning district to the maximum extent feasible given the siteโs topography and natural features.
(2)	To connect to and extend existing road, sidewalk, path, trail, utility, greenway, and open space corridors to the maximum extent feasible given the siteโs topography and natural features.
(3)	So that there will be no foreseeable difficulties in obtaining zoning permits to build on all lots not
intended for conservation purposes in accordance with the standards of these regulations.
(4)	So that there will be no foreseeable difficulties in providing access to buildings on lots not intended for conservation purposes from an existing or planned road.
(5)	To avoid direct access from arterial streets or state highways. The Development Review Board may require shared access or other means to minimize new curb cuts along arterial streets or state highways.
(6)	To allow further subdivision on any remaining undivided land, lots with further subdivision potential, or adjoining undeveloped parcels in a manner that would result in a logical and coordinated development pattern.
 


(7)	So that there will be positive drainage away from building sites and a coordinated stormwater drainage pattern for the subdivision that does not concentrate stormwater drainage from each lot to adjacent lots.

11.4.2	Lot Dimensions. The applicant must design the subdivision:

(1)	So that all lots front on a road.
(2)	So that lot dimensions meet the minimum standards for the zoning district.
(3)	So that generally side lot lines are at right angles to straight roads or radial to curved roads with recognition that some variability may be desirable to respond to the siteโs topography and natural features.
(4)	So that generally rear lot lines are parallel to front lot lines with recognition that some variability may be desirable to respond to the siteโs topography and natural features.
(5)	To avoid flag and other irregularly shaped lots except when desirable to respond to the siteโs
topography and natural features.
(6)	To minimize the number of lots with frontage on more than one road.
(7)	To minimize the number of lots with a rear lot line that abuts the side lot line of an adjacent lot.

11.4.3	Building Envelopes. The applicant must designate one or more building envelopes on each lot not intended for conservation purposes in accordance with the following:

(1)	Building envelopes identify and limit the area(s) of a lot where structures, parking and associated site development may be located. Access and utilities may be located outside a building envelope.

11.5	Design and Layout of Necessary Improvements

11.5.1 Roads. Applicants must design and construct all new roads within a subdivision in accordance with this subsection. A vehicular way that provides access to more than 3 lots or 6 dwelling units will be considered a road.

General. Applicants must design and construct all new roads within a subdivision to:

(1)	Safely accommodate all users (including vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic).
(2)	Provide efficient access to property and avoid congestion on existing roads.
(3)	Logically extend and improve the connectivity of the townโs existing road network.
(4)	Fit into the landscape and follow the natural terrain to the greatest extent feasible.

Topography and Arrangement. New roads must be:

(1)	Designed to relate appropriately to the pre-existing topography and provide adequate drainage.
(2)	Graded and laid out to conform as closely as possible to the pre-existing topography.
(3)	Located and designed to maximize the number of lots with building sites at or above street grade.
(4)	Integrated into the townโs existing road network to the maximum extent feasible.
(5)	Designed with right-of-ways that extend to the boundary lines of the parcel(s) being subdivided to facilitate the coordinated development of adjacent undeveloped land and creation of an interconnected road network unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions.
(6)	Designed to discourage high-speed traffic and to avoid creating short- cuts through neighborhoods that will generate substantial through traffic.
(7)	Designed to minimize the amount of impervious surface necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.

Connectivity. Discontinuous road systems are inefficient and cause undue congestion, while a well- connected road system disperses traffic efficiently and improves walkability. Accordingly, cul-de-sac or dead-end roads are prohibited except that the Development Review Board may approve cul-de-sacs or dead- end roads:

(1)	As stubs to permit future expansion. The Development Review Board may require construction of street stubs or condition approval on a future agreement to extend roads when adjacent property is developed.

(2)	For roads with a traffic volume of 100 trips per day or more on average, lane widths must be at least 9 feet and not more than 10 feet with 2-foot shoulders on both sides.
(3)	For roads intended to accommodate on-street parking, a parking lane at least 7 feet and not more than 9 feet wide may be located on one or both sides of the road.

Drainage. New roads must be designed:

(1)	With drainage facilities to divert run-off to vegetated areas.
 


(2)	To maintain or establish a buffer of natural woody vegetation between roads and surface waters at least 50 feet wide. The Development Review Board may waive or modify the buffer requirement to respond to site specific physical conditions.
(3)	Not to block the flow of drainage in existing ditches, swales or gutters.
(4)	Not to unreasonably contribute to an accumulation of stormwater that would exceed the capacity of downstream facilities or infrastructure.
(5)	With culverts where needed that are sized to convey anticipated peaks stormwater flows and that are not less than 18 inches in diameter.
(6)	With culverts that extend at least 2 feet beyond the edge of the road and that are installed to minimize erosion damage at the inlet and outlet.

Grade. New roads must generally conform to the topography and must not exceed a maximum grade of 7% for gravel roads and 10% for paved roads as measured over any 100-foot section. The Development Review Board may allow short segments to exceed the maximum grade to respond to the siteโs topography and natural features.

11.8.2	Purpose.

Planned Unit Development (PUD) is for large or complex developments that include two or more principal buildings or uses and is planned as a single continuous project under unified control. PUD allows a developer to meet community land use goals without being strictly bound by requirements of the underlying zoning district. This flexibility permits the creation of a designed grouping of varied and compatible land uses, such as housing, recreation, agriculture, commercial centers, and industrial parks, all within one contained development or subdivision. Individual goals for PUD are as follows:
 


(1)	To allow for a complementary mixture of uses in an integrated and well planned area within a single zoning district.
(2)	Encourage and preserve opportunities for the efficient use of public facilities and infrastructure.
(3)	To ensure contiguous and well-planned open space and to protect areas of significant natural resources consistent with the Town Plan and this ordinance.
(4)	Provide a variety of housing types and encourage the development of market priced workforce housing.
(5)	Promote a walkable, sustainable development pattern that supports alternative forms of transportation (walking, biking and mass transit) while still accommodating automobile traffic.
(6)	To provide a more flexible mechanism for the development of quality site layouts while allowing
densities higher than those allowed in the underlying zoning district.

11.8.3	Allowed Uses

Any permitted use or conditional use allowed in the zoning district in which the Planned Unit Development is located will be allowed in the PUD

11.8.4	Allowable Density

In a Planned Unit Development, the Development Review Board may permit densities that exceed those allowed in the underlying district.

11.8.5	Lot Dimension Requirements

The Development Review Board may permit individual lots in a Planned Unit Development to be reduced in required area, and yard dimensions, below the dimensional requirements otherwise prescribed for the particular zoning district in which the PUD is located.

The authority for this Chapter is granted in 24 V.S.A. ยง 1971 (Title 24, Chapter 59, Section 1971), and 24

V.S.A. ยง 2202a (a) (Title 24, Chapter 61, Subchapter 8, Section 2202a), the power to adopt, amend, repeal, and enforce ordinances, and to manage and regulate the solid waste disposal within its boundaries. 24
V.S.A . ยง 2202a (d) requires municipalities implement a variable rate pricing system.


19-2	Purpose of Chapter


This Chapter is enacted to implement a variable rate pricing system to decrease the disposal of solid waste, increase recycling and composting, increase the diversion and reuse of valuable materials in the solid waste stream and otherwise encourage the responsible use of resources and the protection of the environment, and to provide for equitable and fair pricing for solid waste services.

19-3	Definitions


Collection shall mean the gathering, pickup, acceptance, and allowance to drop off municipal solid waste by both solid waste haulers and solid waste facilities such as transfer stations where drop off of municipal solid waste is permitted.

Facility shall mean any site or structure used for treating, storing, processing, recycling, transferring or disposal of municipal solid waste. A Facility may consist of a one or more treatment, storage, recycling, or disposal operations.

Hauler shall mean any person that collects, transports, or delivers solid waste generated within the Town of Manchester.

Mandatory Recyclables include those listed in the Universal Recycling Law such as paper, cardboard, glass, specified plastics and metal.

Municipal Solid Waste hereinafter referred to as "MSW," means combined household, commercial, and

industrial waste materials generated in a given area.
 
Organic Materials include food scraps, leaf and yard waste and other materials that can be diverted from landfills through composting, diverted for agricultural use or treated using anaerobic digestion.

Recycling Methodology means the method of collection used by the Hauler, i.e., single stream/dual stream, type of containers, truck type, and processing facility.

Variable rate pricing means a fee structure that charges for MSW Collection based on its weight or volume.


19-4	Variable Rate Pricing


(1)	Haulers and Facilities that provide Collection and/or drop-off disposal services for MSW to residential customers shall charge these customers for this service on the basis of the volume or weight of the MSW they produce, which is a pricing system commonly referred to as Variable Rate Pricing.

(2)	Each Hauler and Facility shall establish a unit-based price to be charged for the

Collection/drop-off disposal of each unit of MSW from residential customers. These may be based on a price per pound or a price for each 30-gallon bag or 30-gallon container that is collected or disposed of by a resident. Each larger unit of MSW, such as a 64-gallon container or a 50-gallon bag, shall carry an increased price .

(3)	The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prohibit any Hauler or Facility from establishing rules and regulations regarding the safe maximum weight of bags or containers of  municipal solid waste materials.  A Hauler or Facility may refuse to collect or allow disposal of any bag or container which is overloaded or which contains a MSW greater than the rated or specified volume
or weight of such bag or container, or shall account for and bill the customer for the Collection of such excess MSW.

19-5	Flat Fee


(1)	In addition to the unit-based price charged per unit of MSW, Haulers and Facilities may, but are not required to, charge a flat fee to residential customers for the purpose of covering operational costs for collecting, transporting, and disposing of MSW.
 
(2)	Inthe event that a Hauler or Facility elects to establish a flat fee, all bills for services provided to residential customers shall clearly show both the flat fee and the unit-based price to maintain transparency.

(3)	Nothing herein shall prevent or prohibit a Hauler or Facility from charging additional fees for the Collection of materials such as food and yard residuals or bulky items; except however, that no Hauler or Facility may charge a separate line item fee on a bill to a residential customer for the Collection of mandated recyclables after July 1, 2015, in accordance with state statutes. A Hauler or Facility may incorporate the collection cost of mandated recyclables into the cost of the collection of solid waste and may adjust the charge for the collection of solid waste.

19-6	Filing of Pricing System


The Hauler or Facility shall file and submit evidence of their variable rate pricing system, including a breakdown of any and all fees including any flat fees, to the Town of Manchester along with their registration.

19-7	Registration and Reporting


Each hauler shall register with the Town of Manchester annually by December 31st and that registration will be valid for the next calendar year.

WHEREAS, the Board of Water Commissioners has determined that including parcels not connected to the public water (as well as parcels connected) but within one thousand feet of a hydrant for the purposes of financing a portion of water system improvements designed to provide enhanced fire protection is fair and equitable.
