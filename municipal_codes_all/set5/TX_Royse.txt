right of access to and copies of any records held by a governmental body that contain information relating to the
person that is protected from public disclosure by laws intended to protect that person's privacy. The fact that the
information is deemed confidential by privacy principles under state law does not grant the city the right to deny
access to the person or the person's representative, to whom the information relates. However, laws and
provisions of the law, other than ones intended to protect the person's privacy interest, may still form the basis
for denial of access to the person or the person's representative to whom the information relates.

specific person must be in writing and signed by the specific person or the person's authorized representative. A

additional written authorization of the person's parent or guardian. A person who has been adjudicated
incompetent to manage the person's personal affairs or for whom an attorney ad litem has been appointed may
consent to the release of information under this section only by the written authorization of the designated legal
guardian or attorney ad litem.
(c) A release of information pursuant to this section is not a prohibited release of information to the public
under the Public Information Act.
(d) A person who receives information obtained under this section may disclose the information to others only
to the extent consistent with the authorized purposes for which consent to release the information was obtained.
(e) If the city determines that information covered by a special right of access under this section is excepted
from disclosure under any other exceptions under the Public Information Act, the city shall, before disclosing
the information, submit a written request for a decision by the attorney general, pursuant to the Public
Information Act. If a decision is not so requested, the city shall release the information to the person with a
special right of access under this section within 10 days of the received written request for information.
(f) Implementation.
(1) A current picture identification (driver's license, state identification card, passport) must be
submitted by the person making the request, if it is for his/her personal information.
(2) A representative must submit a notarized power of attorney authorizing them access to the
information, along with a picture identification (driver's license, state identification card, passport).
(3) A guardian or attorney ad litem must present a certified copy of the order naming them
guardian or attorney ad litem upon requesting the information. A picture identification (driver's
license, state identification card, passport) must be presented at the time of request.

established in Ordinance 08-04-653 [article 7.02 of the Code of Ordinances]. All appeals will be
conducted in accordance with the administrative hearing process.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 88/652
R112.2 Limitations of appeal.
a. An application for an appeal shall be based solely on a claim that the building official has
incorrectly interpreted or applied this code.
b. The administrative hearing officer shall have no authority to waive, alter or amend any
requirements of this code.
R112.2.1 Determination of substantial improvement in areas prone to flooding. When the
building official provides a finding required in section R105.3.1.1, the administrative hearing
officer shall determine whether the value of the proposed work constitutes a substantial
improvement. A substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the building or structure before the improvement or repair is
started. If the building or structure has sustained substantial damage, all repairs are considered
substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not
include:
1. Improvements of a building or structure required to correct existing health, sanitary
or safety code violations identified by the building official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
2. Any alteration of a historic building or structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the continued designation as an historic building or structure. For the purpose of
this exclusion, an historic building is:
2.1. Listed or preliminarily determined to be eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places;
2.2. Determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as
contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district
preliminarily determined to qualify as an historic district; or
2.3. Designated as historic under a state or local historic preservation program that
is approved by the Department of the Interior.
R112.2.2. Criteria for issuance of a variance for areas prone to flooding. A variance shall only
be issued upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size,
configuration or topography of the site render the elevation standards in section R324
inappropriate.
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable.
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
4. A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief,
considering the flood hazard.
5. Submission to the applicant of written notice specifying the difference between the
design flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built, stating that
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 89/652
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced floor elevation, and stating that construction below the design flood elevation
increases risks to life and property.

a. An appeal filed pursuant to this section shall have no effect on the ability of the city to

initiated by the city.

any person aggrieved by an order, decision or determination made by the building official.

occupants or the citizens of the city.
(Ordinance 95-08-55, sec. 2, adopted 8/8/95)

The city council hereby orders that vacation, reduction of the occupancy load or performance of work on a
structure or dwelling unit found to be in violation of section 3.04.003 be handled in the following manner:
(1) Notice.
(A) The fire marshal or building official shall give notice by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the last known address of the owner, lessor, occupant, mortgagee and lienholder of
the structure, dwelling unit or the real property associated therewith which has been determined
to be in violation of section 3.04.003. The notice shall provide the date, time and place of a
hearing to consider the following:
(i) Reduction of the occupancy load of a structure or dwelling unit that is overcrowded;
(ii) Vacation of a structure or dwelling unit or a portion of a structure or dwelling unit
that is unsanitary or unsafe and that presents a danger to the health, safety or welfare of
the occupants or the general public; and/or
(iii) Performance of work, repair, cleanup or removal of debris required of the structure
or dwelling unit which presents a danger to the health, safety or welfare of the occupants
or the general public.
(B) The fire marshal or building official may place a notice on a structure or dwelling unit
that is overcrowded, unsanitary or unsafe, warning of its hazardous or dangerous condition.
(2) Public hearing. A public hearing to consider reduction of the occupancy load, vacation of a
structure or compliance with section 3.04.003 [and] performance of work for compliance with section
3.04.003 shall be before the municipal judge at least 10 days after receipt of notice by the owner,
lessor, occupant, mortgagee, and lienholder, or at least five days after the mail is returned
undelivered. The fire marshal or building official shall present evidence of the overcrowded or
dangerous condition of the structure and the owner, lessor, occupant, mortgagee and lienholder may
present evidence on relevant issues.
(3) Order to vacate, reduce occupancy load, or perform work.
(A) The municipal judge shall order reduction of the occupancy load if he finds the structure
or dwelling unit is overcrowded in violation of section 3.04.003, or vacation of a structure or
dwelling unit or performance of work if he finds the structure is dangerous to the health, safety
or welfare of the occupants or the public. The municipal judge may order that the occupants of
the structure or dwelling unit be relocated within a reasonable time. Notice of the order to
reduce the occupancy load, to vacate, or to relocate shall be given to the owner, mortgagee or
lienholder. Any order given by the municipal judge shall be filed in the deed records of the
county in which the property is located.
(B) Vacation of a structure or dwelling unit, reduction of the occupancy load by relocation of
the occupants or performance of work for compliance may be accomplished by an owner,

(4) Lien for city's expenses. The expenses incurred in connection with the vacation or relocation of
the occupants or performance of work by the city or its designated representative pursuant to an order
of the fire marshal constitutes a lien against the real property on which the structure or dwelling unit
is located, unless it is a homestead as protected by the state constitution. The city's lien attaches when
notice of the lien is recorded and indexed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the
property is located. The notice must contain the name and address of the owner, if reasonably
determinable, a legal description of the real property, the amount of expenses incurred by the city,
and the balance due. If each mortgagee and lienholder is given notice and an opportunity to relocate,
vacate, repair or demolish the structure, the city's lien is a privileged lien subordinate only to tax liens
and all previously recorded bona fide mortgage liens attached to the property.
(5) Offenses. Each occupant of a structure or dwelling unit that has been ordered vacated shall
vacate the structure or dwelling unit within a specified time determined by the fire marshal. No
person shall occupy a structure or dwelling unit that has been ordered vacated. The occupants of a
structure or dwelling unit has been ordered reduced in occupancy load shall reduce the occupancy to

ARTICLE 3.07 FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION*
Sec. 3.07.001 Statutory authorization
The Legislature of the State of Texas has in the Flood Control Insurance Act, Texas Water Code, section 16.315,
delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses.
Therefore, the city does ordain as follows.
Sec. 3.07.002 Findings of fact
(a) The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(b) These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an
increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods
and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from
flood damage.
Sec. 3.07.003 Statement of purpose
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 140/652
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
Sec. 3.07.004 Methods of reducing flood losses
In order to accomplish its purposes, this article uses the following methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or
cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Sec. 3.07.005 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted to give them the
meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable application.

have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
Sec. 3.07.020 Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH zones)
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.07.007, are areas designated as shallow
flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation or the highest adjacent grade
at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no
depth number is specified).
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures:
(A) Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation
or the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the
community's FIRM (at least 2 feet if no depth number is specified); or
(B) Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base
specified flood depth in an AO zone, or below the base flood elevation in an AH zone, level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of
effects of buoyancy.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 152/652
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain
administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in section 3.07.015 are satisfied.
(4) Require within zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide
floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
Sec. 3.07.021 Floodways
Floodways - located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 3.07.007, are areas designated as
floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and
other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) If subsection (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 3.07.014 through 3.07.022.
(3) Under the provisions of 44 CFR chapter 1, section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
Program regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory
floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first
completes all of the provisions required by section 65.12.
Sec. 3.07.022 Penalties for noncompliance
Failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in
connection with conditions) shall be punished in accordance with section 1.01.009 of this code.

surface of any street, alley or public easement, said permit shall require the person or persons making such cut
across the surface of said way to return the earth and ram and puddle the same to a firm and solid bearing and in
such a manner as will entirely prevent the settling of such earth, and to re-lay the paving, macadamizing, gravel

The city council hereby adopts the following procedures for the consideration of the installation of street humps
on residential roadways. (Ordinance 06-10-533, sec. 2, adopted 10/10/06)
Sec. 3.11.093 Eligible streets
In order to be eligible for installation of street humps, a street shall meet the following minimum requirements:
(1) The street is constructed on a dedicated right-of-way. The city will not install street humps on
private roads or drives.
(2) The street shall be either a concrete street constructed as a type F (residential collector) or type
G (residential) roadway as defined by the city's major thoroughfare plan or an asphalt street
designated as a type F, type G, or not designated on the city's major thoroughfare plan.
(3) The property adjacent to the street shall be either wholly or primarily residential development
or, if undeveloped, shall be either wholly or primarily zoned for residential uses. For purposes of this
division, public parks, public schools, churches, and drainage easements shall be considered
properties zoned for residential uses.
(4) The street shall have no more than one (1) moving lane of traffic in each direction.
(5) The traffic volume on the street shall be less than 5,000 vehicle trips per day.
(6) The street shall have an established speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 201/652
to prohibit installation of street humps on any street considered critical for emergency response.
(8) The city council shall have the sole discretion, except as may be provided in subsection (7)
above, to determine the suitability of any street for the installation of street humps. The determination
of the city council in regard to the suitability of any street for street hump installation, except as
provided in subsection (7) above, shall be final and nonappealable.
(Ordinance 06-10-533, sec. 2.1, adopted 10/10/06)
Sec. 3.11.094 Location on roadway; survey of residents
Once the city council has determined that a roadway is eligible for installation of street humps, the following
conditions shall apply to installation of the street humps:
(1) Sight distance. Adequate sight distance must exist at the desired location of the street hump to
safely accommodate traffic operations after installation of the street hump.
(2) Survey of adjacent residents. A street hump shall not be located in front of, or immediately
adjacent to, any property if the owner of that property objects to its placement, or, in the case of a
property containing multiple low density dwellings, if the majority of the residents upon such
property object to its placement. In order to determine resident support for any proposed installation
of street humps, a survey of area residents meeting the requirements of this section shall be reviewed
by the transportation department. The city shall make available a survey form to any interested
person for use in collecting signatures from the survey area. The survey form shall include a brief
description of the request, traffic operation considerations, and instructions to those completing the
form. In order to be considered for review by the transportation department, the survey shall meet the
following requirements:
(A) For purposes of this division, “survey area” shall include all residences within 500 feet of
the proposed location of the street hump. If the 500-foot distance extends into any part of an
adjacent block, the entire length of the adjacent block shall also be included. For purposes of
this division, “block” shall mean a row of adjacent residences upon a street or roadway which
are separated from other residences upon the street or roadway by an intersecting street or
roadway. Only single-family, duplex, triplex or fourplex residences shall be included in the
survey response. Townhomes shall be considered single-family residences for purposes of this
division. All residences (as described above) whose front or side yard adjoins the street on
which the street hump request is being presented shall be included. Residences which have only
a rear yard adjacent to the street on which the street hump request is being presented shall not
be included. Only one (1) resident per residential address may sign the form. The form shall
include the street address, printed name, signature, and preference (denominated as “support,”
“oppose,” or “no preference”) for each person signing the survey.
(B) A person making request for a street hump and requesting the survey form from the city
shall have three (3) months to secure signatures and submit the form to the transportation
department for consideration. If the necessary signatures are not obtained within that time, a
new survey form will have to be initiated.
(C) In order to be considered for installation of a street hump, at least eighty percent (80%) of
the residents in the survey area must complete the survey form and indicate support for the
installation of the street hump. Only the “support” responses will be considered in determining
the required support level. “Oppose” and “no preference” responses shall not be considered.
The city director of public works shall review the submitted survey to verify that the required
survey area was included and to determine if the 80% threshold of support was achieved.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 202/652
(3) Administrative fee. When a requestor has obtained the requisite number of “support” signatures
(within the time frame set forth herein) the survey form shall be returned to the transportation
department and the requestor shall pay the administrative fee established by the city for processing
such requests.
(Ordinance 06-10-533, sec. 2.2, adopted 10/10/06)
Sec. 3.11.095 Installation procedure; payment of installation cost
(a) When a submitted survey form has been verified as meeting the required survey area support level, the
transportation department shall place the street on a list of streets approved for street hump installation and shall
mail a letter to residents in the survey area advising of the approved street hump request. The letter shall also
advise that the installation cost shall be borne by the residents of the survey area, and that payment of the
installation cost must be made to the city in full before installation of the street hump, and advise of the name
and telephone number of the survey area representative.
(b) The city shall submit an invoice to the survey area representative for the cost of the street hump
installation. The survey area representative will bear the responsibility of collecting and submitting payment for
the street humps to the city. Upon receipt of payment in full of the installation cost of the street hump(s), the city
will schedule installation of the street hump(s) in accordance with the transportation department's normal
scheduling process.
(c) The transportation department shall establish the cost for each street hump installation, and such cost will
be based on the actual cost for a typical street hump installation, including any necessary pavement markings
and/or signage.
(d) If full payment of the cost of the street hump installation has not been made within one (1) year of the date
of the invoice, the street will be removed from the list of streets approved for street hump installation and it will
then be necessary for the survey process described in this division to be reinitiated for consideration of any street
hump upon such roadway.
(Ordinance 06-10-533, sec. 2.3, adopted 10/10/06)
Sec. 3.11.096 Appeals and variances
The city council shall serve as an appeal committee and may consider requests for unusual conditions that do not
fall within the guidelines set forth in this division or for other locations that do not strictly meet the criteria set
forth herein. The following procedure shall govern requests for appeals and variances:
(1) Requests for variances or appeals shall be submitted to the director of public works or his or
her designee and shall describe with particularity the reason(s) why an appeal or variance is being
requested.
(2) If the director of public works, or his or her designee, is unable to resolve the issue giving rise
to the request for variance or appeal, the request shall be forwarded to the city council for
determination. If a majority of the city council determines to consider the request for variance or
appeal, it will be scheduled for a future meeting. If a majority of the city council determines not to
consider the request for variance or appeal at a future meeting, the person making the request shall be
notified of the city council's determination not to consider the request for variance or appeal. If the
request is scheduled for a future meeting, residents may appear at the meeting and, subject to the
discretion of the city council, may be permitted to speak in support of or opposition to the request for
variance or appeal. All determinations of the city council are final and nonappealable. All appeals or
requests for variance which the city council determines, in its sole discretion, to consider, shall be
scheduled on a regular agenda for a city council meeting. No appeal or request for variance will be
considered or discussed unless it has first been placed on a city council agenda for consideration.

months have elapsed since the date of the council's action.

Sec. 4.08.034 General provisions

in its sole discretion, may determine to be in the public interest.

unless terminated earlier by mutual written agreement of the city and the permit holder or pursuant to law. At the

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 268/652

(Ordinance 99-01-150, sec. 4.0, adopted 1/27/99)
Sec. 4.08.035 Compensation to city
(a) Rights-of-way fee established. The permit holder shall pay to the city a rights-of-way fee that is calculated
as of month-end by applying the appropriate line fee to each access line owned, placed, or maintained by the
permit holder that is activated for use by an end user or for another telecommunications service provider that
uses the permit holder's services or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service within the city. The
line fee to be applied to each access line on a monthly basis shall be:
Access Line Monthly Fee per Access Line
Residential $0.84
Nonresidential $1.46
(b) Report of number of access lines. Subject to the city's agreement not to disclose this information, each
permit holder must provide annually, within a reasonable time after receipt of the city's written request, a report
showing the number of each type of access line owned or placed and maintained by the permit holder within the
city that are activated for end-user customers and other telecommunications service providers at month's end for
each of the preceding twelve (12) months. The city agrees that the report shall be used solely for the purpose of
verifying the number of the permit holder's access lines within the city that are activated for end-user customers
and telecommunications service providers. Upon written request, the permit holder shall verify the information
in the report and, upon reasonable advance notice, produce to the city and permit inspection by the city of all
non-customer-specific records and documents reasonably calculated to verify the information. For purposes of
payment of fees for use of the rights-of-way, lines terminating at the customer's premises that are billed as
“Lifeline,” “Tel-Assistance,” or other service that is required to be similarly discounted pursuant to state or
federal law or regulation for the purpose of advancing universal service to the economically disadvantaged shall
not be included in the lines upon which the fee is calculated.
(c) Annexation and disannexation. Within thirty (30) days following the date of the passage of any action
effecting the annexation of any property to or the disannexation of any property from the city's corporate
boundaries, the city agrees to furnish the permit holder written notice of the action and an accurate map of the
city's corporate boundaries showing, if available, street names and number details. For the purpose of
compensating the city under this division, a permit holder shall start including or excluding access lines within
the affected area in the permit holder's count of access lines on the effective date designated by the state
comptroller of public accounts for the imposition of state local sales and use taxes, but in no case less than thirty
(30) days from the date the permit holder is notified by the city of the annexation or disannexation.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 269/652
(d) Confidential records. If the permit holder notifies the city of the confidential nature of any information,
reports, documents, or writings, the city agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the information, reports,
documents, and writings to the extent permitted by law. Upon receipt by the city of requests for the permit
holder's confidential information, reports, documents, or writings, the city shall notify the permit holder of the
request in writing by facsimile transmission. The city shall request an attorney general's opinion before
disclosing any confidential information, reports, documents or writings and will furnish the permit holder with
copies of attorney general opinion requests it makes pertaining to the permit holder's confidential information,
reports, documents or writings.
(e) Payments to be in lieu of all other fees. The payments due hereunder shall be in lieu of any permit, license,
approval, inspection, or other similar fees or charges, including, but not limited to, all general business license
fees customarily assessed by the city for the use of the rights-of-way against persons operating businesses
similar to that of the permit holder. Further, such rights-of-way fee shall constitute full compensation to the city
for all of the permit holder's facilities located within the rights-of-way, including interoffice transport and other
transmission media that do not terminate at an end-user customer's network interface device, even though those
types of lines are not used in the calculation of the rights-of-way fee.
(f) Timing of payment. The permit holder shall remit the line fee on a quarterly basis. The payment shall be
due on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the close of each calendar quarter for which the payment is
calculated.
(g) Uncollectible revenue. The permit holder has a statutory right to pass through to its customers on a pro
rata basis any compensation paid to the city for access to the rights-of-way. Any other provision of this division
notwithstanding, the permit holder shall not be obligated to pay the city for any access lines for which revenues
remain uncollectible.
(h) Facilities provided to other telecommunications service providers. To the extent allowed by applicable
state and federal law, any telecommunications service providers that purchase unbundled network elements or
other facilities for the purpose of rebundling those facilities to create telecommunications service for sale to
persons within the city shall pay to the city a rights-of-way fee that is calculated as of month-end by applying the
appropriate line fee, as specified in subsection (a) of this section, to each access line created by rebundling
services or facilities. Such direct payment to the city is necessary because it is only the person creating the
services for resale that will be able to determine the number of access lines being provided, so that the rights-ofway
fee imposed herein can be applied on a nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications service providers
that sell telecommunications service within the city. Other provisions of this division notwithstanding, the permit
holder shall not include in its monthly count of access lines any unbundled network elements or other facilities
provided to other telecommunications service providers for rebundling into telecommunications services, if the
telecommunications service provider that is rebundling those facilities for resale has provided a signed statement
to the permit holder that the telecommunications service provider is paying the access line fees applicable to
those rebundled services directly to the city. If the permit holder provides a copy of the signed statement to the
city, then the permit holder is absolved of all responsibility for the line fees payable on the telecommunications
service, unbundled network elements, and other facilities rebundled for the creation of telecommunications
service for sale within the city.
(i) Applicability to leased facilities. Pursuant to Tex. Utilities Code section 54.206, a permit holder may
collect the line fee imposed by the city pursuant to this division through a pro rata charge to the customers in the
boundaries of the city, including any other persons who are leasing, reselling or otherwise using the permit
holder's access lines to provide telecommunications service. With respect to any person leasing, reselling, or
otherwise using a permit holder's access lines, if a permit holder believes it does not have sufficient information
to determine the appropriate rate to apply, then the higher line fee shall apply until such time as the person using
the access lines provides to the permit holder sufficient written information to determine the correct line fee. If a
person provides sufficient written information for the application of the line fee, permit holders may bill the
person on the basis of the information provided. The permit holder shall provide to the city any information
regarding the locations to which it is providing service or facilities for use by another person for the provision of
telecommunications service to end-user customers, so long as city first obtains written permission of such other
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 270/652
person for the permit holder to provide the information to the city. Any other provision of this division
notwithstanding, however, a permit holder shall not be liable for underpayment of line fees resulting from the
permit holder's reliance upon the written information provided by any person that uses the permit holder's
service or facilities for the provision of telecommunications service to end-user customers.

not owned by the permit holder. If the city desires to attach or place electric light or power wires,
communications facilities or other similar systems or facilities in or on the permit holder's facilities, then a
further separate, noncontingent agreement with the permit holder shall be required. Nothing contained in this
division shall obligate the permit holder to exercise or restrict the permit holder from exercising its right to enter
voluntarily into pole attachment, pole usage, joint ownership or other wire space or facilities agreements with
any person authorized to operate as a public utility or a telecommunications utility or authorized to offer cable
service within the city.
(c) The surface of the rights-of-way disturbed by the permit holder in the construction or maintenance of its
telecommunications system shall be restored within a reasonable time after the completion of the work to as
good a condition as before the commencement of the work. The permit holder shall endeavor to minimize
disruptions to the efficient use of the rights-of-way by pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and rights-of-way shall
not be blocked for a longer period than shall be reasonably necessary to execute all construction, maintenance
and/or repair work.
(d) Upon request, the permit holder shall remove or raise or lower its aerial wires, fiber or cables temporarily
to permit the moving of houses or other bulky structures. The expense of such temporary rearrangements shall
be paid by the party or parties requesting them, and the permit holder may require payment in advance. The
permit holder shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary
rearrangements.
(e) The permit holder and its contractors and agents have the right, permission and license to trim trees upon
and overhanging the rights-of-way to prevent trees from coming in contact with the permit holder's facilities and
transmission media. When directed by the city, tree trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction
of the city or under the supervision of the city's delegated representative.
(Ordinance 99-01-150, sec. 6.0, adopted 1/27/99)
Sec. 4.08.037 Relocation and removal of facilities
(a) In accordance with Tex. Utilities Code Ann. section 54.203(c), upon thirty (30) days' notice by the city, the
permit holder shall begin relocation of its facilities within the rights-of-way at its own expense to permit the
widening or straightening of streets. The notice by the city shall include a specification of the new location for
the permit holder's facilities along the rights-of-way.
(b) The city retains the right to move any facilities within the rights-of-way to cure or otherwise address a
public health or safety emergency. The city shall cooperate to the extent possible with the permit holder in such
instances to assure continuity of service and to afford to the permit holder the opportunity to make such
relocation itself.

Sec. 4.08.038 Indemnification
The permit holder shall indemnify and hold the city harmless from all costs, expenses, and damages to persons
or property arising directly or indirectly from the construction, maintenance, repair, or operation of the permit
holder's facilities located within the rights-of-way found to be caused solely by the negligence of the permit
holder. Expenses shall include any reasonable and necessary attorney's fees and court costs. The city shall give
the permit holder prompt written notice of any claim for which the city seeks indemnification. The permit holder
shall have the right to investigate, defend and compromise any such claim. This provision is not intended to
create a cause of action or liability for the benefit of third parties, but rather this provision is solely for the
benefit of the permit holder and the city. (Ordinance 99-01-150, sec. 8.0, adopted 1/27/99)

(Ordinance 99-01-150, sec. 9.0, adopted 1/27/99)

provided for in this division becomes unlawful or is declared or determined by a judicial or administrative
authority exercising its jurisdiction to be excessive, unenforceable, void, or illegal, in whole or in part, then the
city and all permit holders shall negotiate a new compensation arrangement that is in compliance with the
authority's decision. Unless explicitly prohibited, the new compensation arrangement shall provide the city with
a level of compensation comparable to that set forth in this division, as long as that compensation is recoverable

ARTICLE 8.03 RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AGAINST CHILDREN*
Sec. 8.03.001 Findings; intent
Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders that use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children
are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to
use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many
more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost
of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. It is the intent of this
article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated
numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residences. (Ordinance 06-10-534, sec. 2 (1.1(a)), adopted 10/10/06)

Premises where children commonly gather. Public parks, private and public schools, amusement arcades, video
arcades, indoor and outdoor amusement centers, amusement parks, public, commercial and semiprivate
swimming pools, and child day care centers, as such terms are defined in the city zoning ordinance, or any
public or nonprofit recreational facility, including, any homeowner's association recreational facility.
Public parks. Includes all parks currently in existence that are designated in the city parks, recreation and open
space master plan, specifically including all hike/bike trails or greenbelts listed in such plan or part of the city
trail network master plan. For purposes of this article, planted street medians are not public parks.
Temporary residence. Either a place where a person abides, lodges or resides for a period of fourteen (14) or
more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not the person's permanent residence, or a
place where a person routinely abides, resides or lodges for a period of four (4) or more consecutive or

Sec. 10.03.033 Purpose
(a) Adequate facilities policy. This division is intended to assure the provision of adequate public facilities to
serve new development in the city by requiring each new development to contribute payments towards its share
of the costs of the capital improvements necessitated by and attributable to the new development.
(b) Regulations supplemental. Impact fees established by this division are additional and supplemental to, and
not in substitution of, any other requirements imposed by the city on the development or subdivision of land, the
issuance of building permits, or the connection of water or wastewater facilities. Impact fees are intended to be

facilities regulations and other city policies by which the city seeks to ensure the provision of adequate public
facilities in conjunction with the development of land. This division is not intended to replace or supersede the
city's public facilities standards and other regulations requiring the dedication, extension or construction of
capital improvements serving new development, and is intended to be interpreted consistently with such
regulations.
(c) Proportionality determination. The maximum impact fee per service unit for any category of capital
improvement under this division may be used in determining whether a city regulation requiring the dedication
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 346/652
or construction of that type of capital improvement is proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts of a
new development on the city's public facilities system pursuant to a petition for relief under the subdivision
regulations.
(Ordinance 07-04-563, sec. 1(B), adopted 4/10/07)
Sec. 10.03.034 Applicability; exceptions
(a) Applicability. The provisions of this division pertaining to water and wastewater and roadway impact fees
apply to all new, nonexempt development within the city limits and its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the
applicable service areas. The provisions of this division pertaining to roadway impact fees apply within the city
limits within the applicable service areas. The provisions of this division shall apply uniformly within each
service area.
(b) Exceptions.
(1) To encourage affordable housing, the city shall refund a percentage of the impact fees paid for
construction of a new single-family dwelling that qualifies for the refund under affordable housing
guidelines approved by the city council.

(3) No impact fee shall be charged for a fire line meter that serves only a fire suppression system.
(Ordinance 07-04-563, sec. 1(C), adopted 4/10/07)
Sec. 10.03.035 Impact fees per service unit
(a) Assessment rate. The maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area shall be established by
category of capital improvements, and shall be as set forth in schedule 1, included in section 10.03.051. The
maximum impact fee per service unit for each service area for each category of capital improvement shall be
computed in the following manner:
(1) Calculate the total projected costs of capital improvements identified in the capital
improvements plan for each category of capital improvements;
(2) From such amounts, subtract a credit equal to 50 percent of such total projected costs; and
(3) Divide the resulting amounts by the total number of service units anticipated in the respective
service area, based on the land use assumptions for that service area.
(b) Alternative method of computing assessment rate. As an alternative to the 50% discount referenced in
subsection (a)(1) above, the city may incorporate within the capital improvements plan for any category of
capital improvements a discount against the total costs of capital improvements, in the amount of that portion of
ad valorem tax and utility service revenues, if any, including the payment of debt, to be generated by new
service units during the period the capital improvements plan is in effect, including the payment of debt,
associated with the capital improvements in the plan.
(c) Collection rate. The impact fee per service unit which is to be paid by each new development shall be
established by ordinance by the city council, and shall be as set forth in schedule 2, included in section
10.03.052. The impact fee per service unit to be collected shall be an amount less than or equal to the maximum
impact fee per service unit calculated under subsection (a) or (b).

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 347/652
(a) Time of assessment. The assessment of the amount of the impact fee per service unit for each category of
capital improvements for a new development shall be made as follows:
(1) For a new development on land which is unplatted at the time of a building permit, plumbing
permit or utility application and for which platting is not required, or for a new development which
had final plat recordation before or on the effective date of Ordinance No. 07-03-562, and for which
replatting is not required, the assessment shall occur at the time a building permit, plumbing permit,
or utility application is submitted, whichever first occurs, and shall be the amount of the maximum
impact fee per service unit then in effect.
(2) For a new development which had final plat recordation after the effective date of Ordinance
No. 07-03-562, or for which replatting results in an increase in the number of service units after such
date, the assessment shall occur at the time of final plat recordation, and shall be the amount of the
maximum impact fee per service unit in effect on the date of recordation.
(b) No increase in fees. Following assessment under subsection (a), the amount of the assessment per service
unit for a development cannot be increased, unless the owner replats all or part of the area covered by the
recorded plat that proposes to change the approved development by the submission of a new application for final
plat approval that results in approval of additional service units, in which case a new assessment for the replatted
area shall occur at the schedule 1 rate in effect at the time of final plat recordation for the replatted area for such
additional service units.
(c) Plat vacation or replat. Following the vacating of any plat or submittal of any replat, a new assessment
must be made in accordance with subsections (a)(1) and (2).
(d) Amending plat. Approval of an amending plat pursuant to Tex. Loc. Gov't Code section 212.016 shall not
change the assessment for new development subject to the amending plat.
(Ordinance 07-04-563, sec. 1(E), adopted 4/10/07)
Sec. 10.03.037 Computation and collection
(a) Time of collection. Impact fees shall be collected at the time the city issues a building permit for land
within the city limits, or at the time a plumbing permit or utility application is approved for land located outside
the city limits, unless provided otherwise in an agreement with a property owner.
(b) Agreement with owner. The city council may approve an agreement with a property owner for a different
time and manner of payment of impact fees for new development on the owner's property.
(c) Exemption. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, no impact fee may be collected for a new
development which was platted prior to the effective date of these regulations and for which a building permit is
issued within one year of such effective date; provided that a building permit that expires or is withdrawn for
such development shall be subject to collection of impact fees.
(d) Amount to be collected. The city shall compute the impact fees for a new development in the following
manner:
(1) The amount of each impact fee shall be determined by multiplying the number of service units
required for the new development by the impact fee per service unit using schedule 2. The number of
service units shall be determined with reference to the land use equivalency table (or, for water and
wastewater impact fees, the table of meter types and sizes), as set forth in the applicable capital
improvements plan.
(2) The amount of each impact fee shall be reduced by any allowable offsets or credits for that
category of capital improvements, in the manner provided in section 10.03.038.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 348/652
(3) The total amount of the impact fees for the new development shall be calculated and attached
to the permit or utility application as a condition of approval.
(4) For water and wastewater impact fees, the amount of impact fees to be collected will be
determined by water meter size, as set forth in the applicable capital improvements plans, using the
impact fee collection rate established in the adopted schedule 2. The appropriate size and type of the
water meter proposed for a new development is to be determined initially by the applicant and is
subject to review and approval by the city engineer, using best water utility industry and engineering
practices and standards. The city engineer may require an applicant to provide building plans,
plumbing layouts, flow calculations and other information to support a request for use of a specific
size or type of water meter.
(e) Limit on fees. The amount of each impact fee for a new development shall not exceed an amount
computed by multiplying the assessment amount per service unit under section 10.03.036 by the number of
service units for the development determined under this section.
(f) Expiration of permit. If a building or plumbing permit or an approved utility application for which an
impact fee has been paid has expired, and a new application is thereafter filed, the impact fees shall be computed
using the schedule 2 then in effect, with credits for previously paid fees being applied against the newly
determined amount.
(g) Increase in service units. Whenever a property owner proposes to increase the number of service units for
a new development, the additional impact fees collected for the new service units shall be determined by using
the schedule 2 then in effect, and the additional fees shall be collected at the times prescribed by this section.
(h) Written notice for new development. For new development served by the city wastewater system and by a
water system other than the city's, the operator of the water system shall provide written notice to the city of
each application for new water service or a change in meter size within 10 days of the date the application is
received. This requirement is satisfied by the submission of a legible copy of the application or other
information that identifies the applicant and indicates the proposed land use and the meter size.
(Ordinance 07-04-563, sec. 1(F), adopted 4/10/07)
Sec. 10.03.038 Offsets and credits
(a) Authorized. The city shall offset or credit the present value of any system facility which has been
dedicated or contributed to by a property owner and accepted by the city, including the value of off-site rightsof-
way or capital improvements constructed under an agreement with the city, against the amount of the impact
fee due for that category of capital improvement, or reimburse the developer for a like amount, in accordance
with the rules in subsection (b). The offset or credit shall be associated with the plat of the property that is to be
served by the system facility.
(b) Calculation. All offsets or credits against impact fees shall be based upon standards promulgated by the
city, which may be adopted as administrative guidelines, including the following standards:
(1) For a water or wastewater facility that has not been included on the capital improvements plan
for the same type of facility, an offset or credit shall not be given for the dedication or construction of
facilities needed to meet the greater of (i) the city's minimum standards for water or wastewater
facilities, or (ii) the needs of the property being developed including, [sic] unless a development
agreement executed before the effective date of this division provides to the contrary.
(2) An offset shall not exceed an amount equal to the eligible costs of the improvement multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the impact fee per service unit due for the new development
computed using schedule 2, and the denominator of which is the maximum impact fee per service
unit for the new development as computed using schedule 1.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 349/652
(3) The unit costs used to calculate offsets and credits shall not exceed those assumed for the
capital improvements included in the impact fees capital improvements plan for the category of
facility for which the impact fee is imposed.
(4) An offset or credit shall not be given for an oversized facility which is not identified within the
capital improvements plan, unless the city engineer determines that the facility supplies capacity to
other new developments, and provisions for offsets or credits are incorporated in a capital
improvements agreement under section 10.03.045, or provision has been made in a development
agreement executed before the effective date of this division.
(5) An offset or credit shall not be given:
(A) When no impact fees for a new development can be collected under this division;
(B) For any amount exceeding the total impact fees due for a new development for that
category of capital improvements, unless expressly agreed to by the city in writing; or
(C) For any oversized facility where the city executes an oversize reimbursement agreement
with the property owner for the oversize cost.
(6) Offsets or credits for system facilities dedicated to and accepted by the city for a new
development prior to the effective date of this division shall be prorated among the total number of
service units within the development, and reduced by an amount equivalent to the number of existing
service units within the development at the time of application, and further reduced by the amount of
any participation funds received from the city and by any payments received from other
developments that utilize the system facility.
(7) The city may participate in the costs of a system facility to be dedicated to the city in
connection with a new development, including costs that exceed the amount of the impact fees due
for the development under schedule 1 for that category of capital improvements, in accordance with
the city's subdivision regulations. The amount of any offset shall not include the amount of the city's
participation.
(8) The amount of an offset or credit may be incorporated in a capital improvements agreement
that provides for reimbursement of the developer, in lieu of reducing the amount of impact fees due
to be collected at the time of building permit, plumbing permit or application for utility connection.
(c) Expiration. Offsets or credits created after the effective date of this division shall expire 10 years from the
date the offset or credit was created. Offsets or credits arising prior to that effective date shall expire ten years
from the date the offset or credit was created. In cases where the amount of an offset or credit is incorporated in
a reimbursement agreement, the term of the agreement shall not exceed ten (10) years.
(d) Application. An offset or credit associated with a new development shall be applied to reduce the impact
fee for the first building or plumbing permit or utility application for the property at the applicable time for
collection of the fee, and thereafter to each subsequent building or plumbing permit or utility application, until
the offset or credit is exhausted. In cases where the amount of an offset or credit is incorporated in a
reimbursement agreement, the agreement shall provide that the amount of reimbursement shall not exceed
annually the amount collected from impact fees for the development.

302.002 of the Texas Finance Code or its successor statute. The application for refund under this section shall be
submitted within 60 days after the expiration of the ten-year period for expenditure of the fee. An impact fee
shall be considered expended on a first in, first out basis.
(b) First in, first out rule. An impact fee collected under this division shall be considered expended if the total
expenditures for capital improvements or facility expansions authorized in section 10.03.040 within 10 years
after the date of payment exceeds the total fees collected for such improvements or expansions during that
period.
(c) Refund for lack of service. Upon written request, all or part of an impact fee collected under this division
shall be refunded if:
(1) Existing service is available and service is denied;
(2) Service was not available when the fee was collected, and the city has failed to commence
construction of facilities to provide service within two years of fee payment; or

Article II. Platting Procedures
Section 2-1. Complete Application Required.
(a) Completeness Determination. Every application for approval of a master plat, preliminary plat,
development plat, minor plat or final plat shall be subject to a determination of completeness by the responsible
official. No application shall be accepted for processing unless it is accompanied by all documents required by
and prepared in accordance with the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations. The responsible official
from time to time may identify additional requirements for a complete application that are not contained within
but are consistent with the application contents and standards set forth in the Subdivision Regulations. The
responsible official also may promulgate a fee for review of the application for completeness.
b. Incompleteness as Grounds for Denial. The processing of an application by any City official or employee
prior to the time the application is determined to be complete shall not be binding on the City as the official
acceptance of the application for filing, and the incompleteness of the application shall be grounds for denial or
revocation of the application. A determination of completeness shall not constitute a determination of
compliance with the substantive requirements of these Subdivision Regulations.
c. Preapplication Conference. A property owner may request a preapplication conference with the responsible
official for purposes of identifying requirements that are applicable to a proposed plat. The request shall be made
in writing on a form prepared by the responsible official and shall state that any proposed development concept
discussed at the preapplication conference is not intended as a plan of development or application for plat
approval.
d. Time for Making Determination. Following submission of a plan of development or plat application, the
responsible official shall make a determination in writing whether the plan or application constitutes a complete
application for a plat not later than the tenth business day after the date the application is submitted. The
determination shall specify the documents or other information needed to complete the application and shall
state the date the application will expire if the documents or other information is not provided.
e. When Deemed Complete. An application for approval of a plat that is filed on or after the effective date of
these subdivision regulations, or any subsequent plat application filed after approval of such initial plat, shall be
deemed complete on the 11th business day after the application has been received, if the applicant has not
otherwise been notified that the application is incomplete.
f. Time for Completing Application. If an application is not completed on or before the 45th day after the
application is submitted to the responsible official for processing the application in accordance with his or her
written notification, the application will be deemed to have expired and it will be returned to the applicant
together with any accompanying documents. Thereafter, a new application for approval of the plat must be
submitted. The City may retain any fee paid for reviewing the application for completeness.
g. Sequence of Applications. Notwithstanding any other provision of these subdivision regulations to the
contrary, a plat application shall not be considered complete unless accompanied by a copy of the zoning
ordinance or other certification verifying that the proposed use for which the application is submitted is
authorized by the zoning district in which the property is located.
h. Vested Rights. No vested rights accrue solely from the filing of an application that has expired pursuant to
this section, or from the filing of a complete application that is subsequently denied.
Section 2-2 Master Plat
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 366/652
(a) Purpose and Effect. The purpose of a master plat shall be to delineate the sequence and timing of
development within a proposed subdivision, where the tract to be developed will be developed in phases or is
part of a larger parcel of land owned by the applicant, in order to determine compliance with the Comprehensive
Plan and the availability and capacity of public improvements needed to serve the development. Approval of a
master plat authorizes the applicant to submit an application for approval of a preliminary subdivision plat.
(b) Applicability. A master plat shall be required for any division of land where proposed development of the
tract is to occur in phases, or for land inside city limits, where the land is located within an existing or proposed
PD Planned Development District. A master plat may not be accepted for filing, if the land subject to the master
plat exceeds 250 acres for single-family residential developments, or 100 acres for other types of developments.
A phasing schedule for the master plat shall not be for more than five (5) years. The limitations on acreage and
phasing schedule do not apply where the proposed acreage or phasing schedule for the master plat is in
conformity with an approved planned development district or where a waiver has been granted by the City
Council. If the land subject to the master plat is part of a larger parcel, the remaining land shall be shown as a
remainder tract, but shall not be included within the master plat.
(c) Remainder tract. A remainder tract is that portion of a larger parcel that is not included within the
boundaries of a subdivision plat. Remainder tracts shall not be considered lots or tracts of the subdivision.
Approval of a subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of development on a remainder tract. The City may
require that information be submitted for a remainder tract with a master plat application solely for the purpose
of determining whether the planned public facilities and improvements proposed to serve the master plat will be
adequate. Information concerning remainder tracts may be considered in formulating conditions to approval of
the master plat application. Based upon such information, the commission may require that additional or less
land be included in the subdivision plat in order to satisfy the standards applicable to the plat application. If the
master plat is approved, a plat application for a remainder tract shall not be accepted for filing until a final plat
has been approved for the first phase of the master plat.
(d) Application. An application for a master plat shall be submitted to the responsible official, together with
fifteen (15) copies of the master plat drawn at a scale of not more than four hundred (400) feet to the inch. If
more detailed contour information is not available, the USGS map contours may be used for concept planning
purposes in most cases. The application for the master plat shall include the following information:
(1) Names and addresses of the subdividers, record owner, land planner, engineer and/or surveyor.
(2) Proposed name of the subdivision.
(3) Location in relation to the rest of the city and boundaries of proposed subdivision.
(4) A schematic layout of the entire tract to be subdivided, any remainder tracts and its relationship
to adjacent property and existing adjoining developments.
(5) Proposed major categories of land use showing existing and proposed zoning.
(6) Proposed number of dwelling units and population densities.
(7) Proposed and existing arterials and collector streets to serve the land to be platted consistent
with the Thoroughfare Plan or proposed amendments.
(8) Location of proposed sites for parks, schools and other public uses as consistent with those
shown in the comprehensive plan.
(9) Significant natural drainage features including drainage courses and wooded areas, as
delineated on USGS topographic maps or on any other topographic maps showing equivalent
information.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 367/652
(10) Significant man-made features such as railroad, roads, buildings, utilities or other physical
structures as shown on USGS topographic maps, utility company records and city records when such
features affect the plan.
(11) Proposed dedication of land or rights-of-way for and construction of public improvements,
whether on-site or off-site, intended to serve each proposed phase of the subdivision.
(12) Designation of each phase of development within the subdivision, the order of development,
and a schedule for the development of each phase of the master plat.
(13) A detailed statement of how the proposed subdivision will be served by water, wastewater,
roadway and drainage facilities that have adequate capacity to serve the development.
(e) Procedures.
(1) Planning and Zoning Commission Action. After review of the master plat application by the
responsible official and the city engineer, the application shall be scheduled for consideration by the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The Commission shall decide whether to approve, approve with
conditions or deny the master plat application based on the criteria for approval in subsection (f).
(2) City Council Action. Following decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City
Council shall determine whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny the master plat
application, taking into consideration the action taken by the Commission, and the criteria for
approval in subsection (f).
(3) Conditions. The Commission or the Council may impose such conditions to the approval of the
master plat application as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the criteria in
subsection (f). Such conditions may address but are not limited to matters involving conformity with
the City's zoning regulations, the availability and capacity of public improvements, or the phasing of
development. In addition to other conditions, approval of the master plat may be conditioned on
exclusion of land from the master plat or adjustments in the proposed sequence or timing in the
proposed phases of the development.
(f) Criteria for Decision. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether the application for a master
plat shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied:
(1) The master plat is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, including but not limited to
the future land use map, thoroughfare plan and facilities elements; all existing or proposed zoning
requirements for the property, including any development plans for a PD Planned Development
District and standards of any applicable overlay district; and any approved development or
annexation agreements.
(2) The proposed provision and configuration of roads, water, wastewater, drainage and park
facilities generally conforms to the City's master facilities plans for such facilities.
(3) The water, wastewater, roadway and drainage systems serving the development have adequate
capacity to accommodate the demands for services created by each phase of the development by the
time of final plat approval.
(4) The schedule of development is feasible and prudent, and assures that the proposed
development will progress to completion within the time limits proposed.
(5) The location, size and sequence of the phases of development proposed assure orderly and
efficient development of the land subject to the plat. Each phase of the development shall contain the
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 368/652
minimum number of dwelling units or quantity of nonresidential use to assure that such standard is
met.
(6) Where the proposed development is located in whole in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the city and is subject to an interlocal agreement under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ch. 242, the
proposed master plat meets any county standards to be applied pursuant to the agreement.
(g) Expiration and Extension.
(1) Time of Expiration. Expiration of the master plat shall be governed by the schedule of
development approved by the Council. The subdivider shall submit and receive approval for a
preliminary plat for the first and all subsequent phases of the master plat within the time limits
prescribed in the approved phasing schedule. Failure to meet a platting deadline included in the
phasing schedule shall result in the expiration of the master plat for that and all subsequent phases of
the subdivision. Expiration of the preliminary plat for any phase of the master plat shall result in the
expiration of the master plat for all phases for which a preliminary plat has not been approved and
remains in effect.
(2) Extension. The expiration date for any phase of the development may be extended by the City
Council for a period of not more than one (1) year, provided that a request for extension is made in
writing by the subdivider at least thirty (30) days before the approved master plat lapses. Extension of
the expiration date for the phase extends the expiration date for the master plat for a like period.
Every request for extension shall include a statement of the reasons why the expiration date should be
extended. The Council shall take into account the reasons for the requested extension, the ability of
the applicant to comply with any conditions attached to the original approval, whether extension is
likely to result in timely completion of the project, and the extent to which newly adopted regulations
should be applied to the original application. The Council may attach conditions to approval of an
extension request such as are needed to assure that the land will be developed in a timely fashion and
that the public interest is served, including a requirement that one or more current development
standards be applied to subsequent plat applications within the area subject to the master plat.
Section 2-3. Preliminary plat.
(a) Applicability. A preliminary plat must be prepared for all subdivisions within the corporate limits of the
City. A preliminary plat is neither authorized nor required in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, unless
expressly authorized by a valid and approved development agreement.
(b) Application. An application for approval of a preliminary plat along with fifteen (15) prints of the
proposed subdivision shall be filed with the responsible official at least fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting of
the planning and zoning commission at which time approval is asked. The preliminary plat shall be submitted on
standard twenty-four-inch by thirty-six-inch paper at a scale of one inch equals one hundred (100) feet by the
subdivider or his agent prior to the sale, offering sale of any lots, tract or building site and prior to completion of
final surveys of streets or lots prior to the grading or construction work on any streets and before any map of
such subdivision is prepared in form for recording. Where a master plat has been approved, the information
contained in the preliminary plat application shall identify the phase of the master plan which the preliminary
plat represents and shall be consistent with the information shown on the master plat. The preliminary plat
application shall be submitted in accordance with and be accompanied by the following in accordance with the
manual of standard design, manual of water distribution, and manual of street[s] and drainage:

with conditions or deny the preliminary plat application based on the criteria for approval in
subsection (d).
(2) City Council Action. Following decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the City
Council shall determine whether to approve, approve with conditions or deny the preliminary plat
application, taking into consideration the action taken by the Commission, and the criteria for
approval in subsection (d).
(3) Conditions. The Commission or the Council may impose such conditions to the approval of the
preliminary plat application as are reasonably necessary to assure compliance with the criteria in
subsection (d). Such conditions may address but are not limited to matters involving conformity with
the City's zoning regulations, the availability and capacity of public improvements, or the phasing of
development.
(d) Criteria for Decision. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether the application for a
preliminary plat shall be approved, approved with conditions, or denied.
(1) Where applicable, the preliminary plat conforms to the approved master plat;
(2) Where no master plat has been approved, the preliminary plat is consistent with the adopted
Strategic Plan for Royse City, including but not limited to the future land use map, the master
thoroughfare plan and master facilities plans;
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 371/652
(3) The plat is consistent with all zoning requirements for the property, and any approved
development agreement;
(4) The proposed provision and configuration of roads, water, wastewater, drainage and park
facilities conform to the master facilities plans for the facilities, including without limitation the
water facilities, wastewater facilities, transportation, drainage and other master facilities plans;
(5) The plat meets all other requirements of these subdivision regulations;
(6) The plat meets any county standards to be applied under an interlocal agreement between the
City and a county under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code ch. 242, where the proposed development is located in
whole or in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City and in the county.
(e) Effect of Approval. Approval of a preliminary plat shall authorize the subdivider to submit construction
plans for approval by the City Engineer and, upon approval of such plans, to construct public improvements to
serve the subdivision in accordance therewith. Approval of a preliminary plat also shall authorize the subdivider
to seek approval of a final plat for the land subject to the preliminary plat. The responsible official shall not
accept any engineering plans until such preliminary plat has been approved by the city council. No excavation,
grading, tree removal or site clearing activities shall occur prior to approval of the preliminary plat and the
construction plans.
(f) Lapse and Extension.
(1) Expiration of plats. The applicant shall submit a final plat to the City for the entire area for
which a preliminary plat has been approved, within nine (9) months of the date of approval or
conditional approval of the preliminary plat. If the property owner fails to submit a final plat
application within such period, the preliminary plat shall lapse, together with any portion of the
master plat for which a preliminary or final plat has not been approved and remains in effect, and all
further proceedings concerning the subdivision shall terminate. The applicant shall be required to
submit a new preliminary plat, as required by this Chapter, subject to all zoning and subdivision
standards then in effect.
(2) Extension and reinstatement procedure.
a. Sixty days prior to the lapse of approval for a preliminary plat, the property owner may
petition the Planning and Zoning Commission to extend or reinstate the approval. Such petition
shall be considered at a public meeting of the Commission.
b. In determining whether to grant such request, the Commission shall take into account the
reasons for lapse, the ability of the property owner to comply with any conditions attached to
the original approval, the extent to which the property owner agrees to abide by newly adopted
subdivision regulations, and any changed conditions in the surrounding area which would make
an extension undesirable. The Commission shall extend its approval of the plat, or deny the
request. In the event the Commission denies extension of the preliminary plat, the property
owner must submit a new application for approval.
c. The Commission may specify a shorter time for lapse of the extended plat that is
applicable to original approvals, but shall not extend the period that a preliminary plat approval
is valid to more than two years from the date of original approval.
d. At any time following the lapse of approval of a preliminary plat, a developer may request,
and the Commission may approve, at its discretion, a reinstatement of such preliminary plat for
the purpose of considering and approving a final plat for all or a portion of the area covered by
the preliminary plat. The Commission shall reinstate a preliminary plat only when it determines
that it would be in the public interest to do so to avoid unnecessary review of a new preliminary
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 372/652
plat, and when the pattern of development proposed by the plat would not be to the detriment of
any nearby area or the general development of the City. The Commission may establish such
conditions on reinstatement as are necessary to ensure that the reinstated plat conforms to the
City's comprehensive plan, including a requirement that the plat conform to the City's current
subdivision standards.
(g) Revisions Following Approval of Preliminary Subdivision
(1) Minor Changes. Minor changes in the design of the subdivision subject to a preliminary plat
may be incorporated in an application for approval of a final plat without the necessity of filing a new
application for approval of a preliminary plat. Minor changes shall include adjustment in street or
alley alignments, lengths, and paving details, and adjustment of lot lines that do not result in creation
of additional lots, provided that such changes are consistent with any approved priority applications.
(2) Amendments. All other proposed changes to the design of the subdivision subject to an
approved preliminary plat shall be deemed major amendments that require submittal and approval of
a new application for approval of a preliminary plat before approval of a final plat. Approval of
major revisions to an approved preliminary plat shall occur prior to the date any approved master plat
would have expired for the same land.

(1) Purpose. The purpose of a final plat is to assure that the division or development of the land
subject to the plat is consistent with all standards of these subdivision regulations and all other City
ordinances pertaining to the adequacy of public facilities, that public improvements to serve the
subdivision or development have been installed and accepted by the City or that provision for such
installation has been made, and that all other requirements and conditions have been satisfied or
provided for to allow the plat to be recorded.
(2) Applicability. Approval of a final plat shall be required prior to any nonexempt division of land
and prior to any site preparation activities for a lot or tract of land that requires installation of public
improvements on or adjacent thereto. A final plat application shall not be required for any land
division that may be approved through the minor plat procedures in section 2-6.
(3) Effect. Approval of a Final Subdivision Plat authorizes the responsible official to record the
plat upon completion of public improvements or posting of security, and authorizes the subdivider to
install any improvements in public rights-of-way under approved construction plans and a
subdivision improvement agreement.
(b) Application. After the preliminary plat, where required, has been approved by the City Council, a final
plat, in the form of a record, shall be prepared in accordance with the conditions of approval and submitted to
the City's engineer and responsible official for review and transmission to the City Planning and Zoning
Commission. Where no preliminary plat is authorized, the final plat application must meet all the submittal
requirements for a preliminary plat that are not included in the list of application requirements that follow.
Fifteen (15) prints and three (3) mylars shall be filed in the office of the responsible official at least fourteen (14)
days prior to the meeting at which time final approval is asked. The mylar plat shall be submitted on a scale of
one hundred (100) feet to one inch and one reduced print shall be of a size which will fit on an eighteen-inch by
twenty-four-inch sheet for filing with the county. The final plat shall show, or be accompanied by the following
information:
(1) The names of the owner and/or subdivider and of the licensed state land surveyor, or registered
engineer responsible for the plat.

and/or easements, if any, to be imposed and reserved in connection with the addition. Such
restrictions shall contain the following provisions, along with any other restrictions which may be
imposed:
“No house, dwelling unit or other structure shall be constructed on any lot in this addition
by the owner or any other person until:
a. Such time as the developer and/or owner has complied with all requirements of the Platting
Ordinance of the City of Royse City regarding improvements with respect to the entire block on
the street and/or streets on which the property abuts (a corner lot shall be regarded as abutting
on both intersection streets adjacent to such lot,) including the actual installation of streets,

of the City of Royse City or
(Ordinance 06-04-501 adopted 4/27/06)
b. Until the escrow deposit, sufficient to pay for the cost of such improvements, as
determined by the city's engineer and/or city manager, computed on a private commercial rate
basis, has been made with the city secretary, accompanied by an agreement signed by the
developer and/or owner, authorizing the city to make such improvements at prevailing private

(12) Final plats shall be accompanied by plan-profile sheets, twenty-four (24) inches by thirty-six
(36) inches and platted to a scale of one hundred (100) feet to one (1) inch horizontal and ten (10)
feet to one inch vertical, for each proposed street in the subdivision. These plan-profiles shall show

(Ordinance 06-04-501 adopted 4/27/06)
(13) Typical cross sections shall be shown of the type and width of paving proposed for all streets.
Curbs and gutters, pavement types and drainage structure design standards of the city, in effect at the

(c) Procedures.
(1) The Planning and Zoning Commission shall take action on the final plat as within thirty (30)
days of the official filing date unless the applicant requests and consents in writing to waive any time
deadline for action upon the plat. If the final plat meets all the requirements of these subdivision
regulations, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall approve the plat. If the plat does not meet the

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 376/652
requirements of these subdivision regulations, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall disapprove
the plat.
(2) The City Council, following action by the Planning and Zoning Commission, shall finally
decide whether to approve or deny the final plat application.
(d) Final Plat in ETJ. The only plat application authorized within the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction is a
final plat application. The applicant may propose a subdivision of land that creates a remainder tract, as defined
in section 2-2(c). The applicant must submit the information required by the City for a remainder tract with the
application for final plat approval. The Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council may approve the
proposed subdivision, or require that the remainder tract be included within the final plat. If the City allows the
applicant to create the remainder tract, the provisions of section 2-2(c) shall apply. No conceptual plan of
development may accompany a final plat application in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction where the final plat
application does not contain all contiguous land in common ownership, unless the application also proposes a
remainder tract. Where a conceptual plan of development is presented with a final plat application and
designation of a proposed remainder tract, such conceptual plan shall be deemed denied with approval of the
final plat application and designation of the remainder tract.
(e) Criteria for Decision. The following criteria shall be used to determine whether the application for a final
plat shall be approved or denied.
(1) The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plat except for minor changes authorized
under section 2-3(g) and that may be approved without the necessity of revising the approved
preliminary plat. Where no preliminary plat is authorized, the final plat shall satisfy any criteria under
section 2-3(d) for preliminary plat approval which are not identified below.
(2) Where public improvements have been installed, the improvements conform to the approved
construction plans and have been approved for acceptance by the City engineer.
(3) Where the City Council has authorized public improvements to be deferred, the subdivision
improvement agreement and surety have been executed and submitted by the property owner in
conformity with section 2-6 [2-5].
(4) The final layout of the subdivision meets all standards for adequacy of public facilities
contained in these subdivision regulations and City ordinances.
(5) The plat meets any county standards to be applied under an interlocal agreement between the
City and a county under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code ch. 242, where the proposed development is located in
whole or in part in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City within the county.
(6) The plat conforms to City's adopted comprehensive plan, including its future land use map
(within city limits), the master plans for current and future streets, alleys, parks, playgrounds, and
public utility facilities, as well as extension of the City's roads, streets, and public highways within its
extraterritorial jurisdiction, taking into account access to and extension of sewer and water mains and
the instrumentalities of public utilities[.]
(7) The plat conforms to the City's zoning regulations or regulations contained in an approved
development agreement affecting the land, and all other applicable City ordinances and regulations.
(f) Expiration and Extension. The approval of a final plat application shall remain in effect for a period of two
years from the date the application was approved by the City Council, during which period the applicant shall
submit any required revisions for approval and record the plat. If the final plat has not been recorded within the
two-year period, final plat approval shall expire and the applicable plat shall be deemed null and void.
(g) Recordation.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 377/652
(1) After approval of the final plat, the responsible official shall record the final plat with the
county clerk of the county in which the land is located upon the subdivider's performance of one of
the following:
(i) Completion of the construction of required improvements prior to recordation; or
(ii) Filing of security in lieu of completing construction in accordance with section 2-6 [2-5].
(2) Submittal of Record Plat Where Improvements Installed. Where public improvements have
been installed prior to recording of the plat, the property owner shall submit a maintenance bond in
accordance with section 2-6 [2-5] from each contractor, three sealed sets of “as built” plans or record
drawings, one sealed set of “as built” mylars, and a digital copy of all plans (in a format as
determined by the City Engineer), bearing sealed certification by the design engineer that all public
improvements have been constructed in compliance with all City construction standards. The
property owner also shall submit copies of the approved final plat, revised to reflect the “as built”
plans.
(3) Submittal of Record Plat Where Improvements Have Not Been Installed. Where public
improvements have yet to be completed in connection with an approved final plat, the property
owner shall have the approved final plat revised to reflect any changes required by the City Council.
(4) Signing and Recording. Upon receipt of a complete record plat application, the responsible
official shall procure the signature of the mayor on the plat and shall promptly cause the plat to be
recorded.
Section 2-5 Construction Management
(a) Construction Plans. The City Engineer shall review and approve, approve with conditions or disapprove
construction plans following approval of a preliminary plat, or where no preliminary plat is authorized, prior to
application for final plat approval and within 30 business days after the plans have been determined to be
complete in accordance with the procedures in section 2-1. Incomplete plans shall be returned to the applicant.
(1) If construction plans are approved, the plans shall be marked “approved” and one set shall be
returned to the applicant, and at least two sets shall be retained in the City's files.
(2) Once the construction plans are approved, the property owner shall provide additional sets of
the approved plans to the City, as specified by the Engineering Director, for use during construction.
A full set of the City-approved and stamped construction plans must be available for inspection on
the job site at all times.
(3) If the conditions of approval require revision(s) to the construction plans, one set shall be
marked with objections noted (on the plans themselves and/or in memo format) and returned to the
applicant for correction, whereupon the applicant's engineer shall correct the plans as requested and
resubmit them for decision. A properly revised set of construction plans shall be submitted to the City
Engineer within 10 working days of receipt of the notice of the City's Engineer's decision.
(4) Approval of construction plans authorizes the property owner to install public improvements in
rights-of-way offered for dedication to the public under an approved preliminary or final plat.
(b) Timing of Public Improvements.
(1) Completion Prior to Final Plat Approval. Except as provided below, after approval of a plat and
before an approved final plat application is filed, the installation of all public improvements required
to serve the subdivision, whether to be located off-site or on-site, including but not limited to water,
wastewater, drainage, roadway and park improvements, shall be finally completed in accordance with
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 378/652
the approved construction plans. The installation of improvements required for proper drainage and
prevention of soil erosion on individual residential lots, and improvements on any common areas,
also shall be finally competed prior to final plat approval in accordance with the approved
construction plans.
(2) Deeds in Escrow. As a condition of preliminary plat approval, the City Council may require the
property owner to deposit deeds in escrow describing by metes and bounds street rights-of-way, park
land, and easements required by these regulations, conveying such rights-of-way, park land and
easements to the City, pending acceptance of improvements by the City and recordation of the final
plat. In the event the property owner fails to complete the public improvements, and the
improvements are deemed necessary for the preservation of the public health and safety, the City may
compel the delivery and recording of the deeds in order to complete the improvements as required.
(3) Installation after Final Plat Approval. The City Council on request of the applicant may defer
the obligation to install one or more public improvements to serve the subdivision until after final
plat approval. The request shall be submitted with an application for preliminary approval. If the
subdivider elects not to file for preliminary approval, public improvements shall be installed after
approval of the final plat. In either case, deferral of the obligation to install public improvements
shall be conditioned on execution of a subdivision improvement agreement and sufficient surety to
secure the obligations defined in the agreement.
(4) Off-Site Easements. All necessary off-site easements required for installation of off-site public
improvements to serve the subdivision or development shall be acquired by the subdivider and
conveyed solely to the City by a deed approved by the City Attorney.
(c) Subdivision Improvement Agreement
(1) Obligations under Agreement. Whenever public improvements to serve the development are
deferred until after final plat approval, the property owner shall enter into a subdivision improvement
agreement by which the owner covenants to complete all required public improvements, including
residential lot improvements for drainage or erosion control, and common area improvements, no
later than two years following the date upon which the final plat is approved. The agreement shall be
subject to review and approval by the City Attorney, and shall be approved by the City Council with
approval of the final plat. The agreement shall contain the following provisions:
a. Covenants to complete the improvements;
b. Covenants to warranty the improvements for a period of two years following acceptance
by the City;
c. Covenants to provide a maintenance bond in the amount of 100% of the costs of the
improvements for such period;
d. Provisions for participation in the costs of the improvements by the City, if authorization
has been obtained from the City Council and a performance bond for such improvements from
the contractor, with the City as a co-obligee;
e. Provisions for securing the obligations of the agreement; and
f. Such other terms and conditions as are agreed to by the property owner and City.
(2) Covenants to Run with the Land. The subdivision improvement agreement shall provide that
the covenants contained in the agreement run with the land and bind all successors, heirs and
assignees of the property owner. All existing lienholders shall be required to execute the agreement
or provide written consent to the covenants contained in the agreement. The City shall deliver a
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 379/652
release to bona fide third-party purchasers of individual lots when all required public improvements
have been accepted by the City.
(d) Security for Completion of Improvements
(1) Security. Whenever the obligation to install public improvements to serve a subdivision or
development is deferred until after approval of the final plat, the property owner shall provide
sufficient security to ensure completion of the required public improvements. The security shall be in
the form of one of the following:
a. A cash escrow with the City;
b. An irrevocable letter of credit drawn upon a state or national bank that has a regular
business office in the state of Texas that (A) is of a term sufficient to cover the completion,
maintenance and warranty periods, but not less than two years and (B) authorizes the City to
draw upon the letter of credit by presenting to the issuer only a sight draft and a certificate
signed by an authorized representative of the City attesting to the City's right to draw funds
under the letter of credit;
c. A construction funding agreement under which funds for the construction of the required
improvements are escrowed in Texas with an office of a state or national bank, under which (A)
the City has the irrevocable right to withdraw funds, and (B) the subdivider may be permitted to
draw funds to make payments towards the construction of the improvements as progress is
verified; or
d. A first and prior lien on the property.
(2) Amount and Acceptability. The security shall be issued in the amount of 125% of the cost
estimate approved by the City Engineer for all public improvements associated with the subdivision.
The security shall be subject to the approval of the City Attorney.
(3) Security for Construction in Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. Where the land to be platted lies
within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City, the security shall be in a form and contain such
terms as are consistent with the interlocal agreement between the City and the county in which the
land is located. In cases where the requirements governing the form and terms of the security are
defined in such an agreement, they will supersede any conflicting provisions of subsections (1) and
(2).
(4) Partial Release. If, in the opinion of the responsible official and the City Engineer, the public
improvements have commenced in good faith, a release for construction on up to five percent of the
residential lots may be issued. A lot must have permanent street access installed to it prior to this
release.
(5) Remedies. In addition to all other remedies authorized in this article, where a subdivision
improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and required public
improvements have not been installed in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the City may:
a. Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the public improvements be
installed regardless of the extent of completion of the development at the time the agreement is
declared to be in default;
b. Obtain funds under the security and complete the improvements itself or through a third
party; or
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 380/652
c. Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party, including a
subsequent owner of the development in exchange for the subsequent owner's agreement and
posting of security to complete the public improvements serving the tract.
(e) Inspection and Acceptance of Public Improvements
(1) Inspections. Construction inspection shall be supervised by the City Engineer. Construction
shall be in accordance with the approved construction plans. Any significant change in design
required during construction shall be made by the subdivider's engineer, and shall be subject to
approval by the City Engineer. If the City Engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required
public improvements have not been constructed properly and in accordance with the approved
construction plans, the property owner shall be responsible for completing and/or correcting the
public improvements.
(2) Submission of As-Built Plans or Record Drawings. The City shall not accept dedication of
required public improvements until the applicant's engineer has certified to the City Engineer,
through submission of a detailed “as-built” record drawing or survey plat of the property and any offsite
easements, the location, dimensions, materials, and other information establishing that the public
improvements have been built in accordance with the approved construction plans. Each as-built
sheet shall show all changes made in the plans during construction and on each sheet there shall be an
as-built stamp bearing the signature of the engineer and date. Required formats include:
a. One (1) full-size mylar set (22" x 34" sheet size)
b. Electronic drawing files of:
(i) Final plat;
(ii) Water, wastewater and storm drainage layouts.
(3) Acceptance of Improvements. When the City Engineer has determined that the public
improvements have been installed in accordance with the approved construction plans, the City
Engineer shall accept such improvements on behalf of the City. Acceptance of the improvements
shall mean that the property owner has transferred all rights to all the public improvements to the
City for use and maintenance. The City Engineer may accept dedication of a portion of the required
public improvements, provided adequate surety has been given for the completion of all of other
improvements. Upon acceptance of the required public improvements, the Director shall issue a
certificate to the property owner stating that all required public improvements have been
satisfactorily completed.
(4) Disclaimer. Approval of a preliminary or final plat by the City Council shall not constitute
acceptance of any of the public improvements required to serve the subdivision or development. No
public improvements shall be accepted for dedication by the City except in accordance with this
section.
(5) Acceptance of Improvements for Land in Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. Where the facilities to be
constructed under the subdivision improvement agreement are located within the City's
extraterritorial jurisdiction, and are to be dedicated to the county in which the land is located, the City
Engineer shall inform the county that the public improvements have been constructed in accordance
with approved construction plans, and are ready for acceptance by the county.
(f) Maintenance and Warranty of Improvements
(1) Maintenance During Construction. The property owner shall maintain all required public
improvements during construction of the development.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 381/652
(2) Bond. The owner shall covenant to warranty the required public improvements for a period of
one year following acceptance by the City of all required public improvements and shall provide a
maintenance bond in the amount of 100% of the costs of the improvements for such period. All
improvements located within an easement or right-of-way shall be bonded.
Section 2-6 Minor Plats
(a) Applicability. An application for approval of a Minor Plat may be filed only when all of the following
circumstances apply:
(1) The proposed division results in four or fewer lots;
(2) All lots in the proposed subdivision front onto an existing public street and the construction or
extension of a street or alley is not required to meet the requirements of these subdivision regulations;
and
(3) The plat does not require the extension of any municipal facilities to serve any lot within the
subdivision.
(b) Decision. The responsible official shall decide whether to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the
Minor Plat application.
(c) Criteria for Decision. The responsible official, or the Planning and Zoning Commission on appeal, shall
decide whether to approve, conditionally approve or deny the Minor Plat application based upon the following
criteria:
(1) The minor plat application is consistent with all zoning requirements for the property, all other
requirements of these subdivision regulations that apply to the plat, and standards of any approved
development agreement;
(2) All lots to be created by the plat already are adequately served by all required utilities and
services, and
(3) The plat does not require the extension of any municipal facilities to serve any lot within the
subdivision.
(d) Expiration. The approval of a Minor Plat application shall remain in effect for a period of one year from
the date that the application was approved or conditionally approved by the responsible official or the Planning
and Zoning Commission on appeal, during which period the applicant shall submit any required revisions for
approval and record the plat. If the Minor Plat has not been recorded within the one-year period, the Minor Plat
approval shall expire and the plat shall be deemed null and void.
(e) Recording. The property owner shall submit the approved Minor Plat, following any required revisions, to
the responsible official, who shall cause the Minor Plat to be recorded in the property records of the county in
which the land is located.
Section 2-7 Waivers.
The applicant may file a petition for waivers to the standards applicable to a preliminary plat, or where no
preliminary plat application is authorized, to the standards applicable to a final plat. The waiver petition shall be
decided by the Council in conjunction with the application for approval of the plat. The applicant bears the
burden of proof to demonstrate that a waiver to the standardsapplicable to a development application should be
granted. In deciding the waiver petition, the decision-maker shall apply the following criteria:
(1) There are special circumstances or conditions arising from the physical surroundings, shape,
topography or other feature affecting the land subject to the waiver petition, such that the strict
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0

Section 2-8 Proportionality Appeal
(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
(1) Public infrastructure improvement means a water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park
facility that is a part of one or more of the City's public facilities systems.
(2) Public facilities system means the collection of water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park
facilities owned or operated by or in behalf of the City for the purpose of providing services to the
public, including existing and new developments.
(b) Purpose, Applicability & Effect
(1) Purpose. The purpose of a proportionality appeal is to assure that a requirement to dedicate,
construct or pay a fee for a public infrastructure improvement imposed on a proposed plat as a
condition of approval does not result in a disproportionate cost burden on the property owner, taking
into consideration the nature and extent of the demands created by the proposed development on the
City's public facilities systems.
(2) Applicability. An appeal under this section may be filed by a property owner to contest any
requirement to dedicate land, to construct improvements or to pay development fees, other than
impact fees, for a public infrastructure improvement, which requirement is imposed under the City's
Subdivision Regulations, whether the requirement is applicable under uniform standards, or is
imposed pursuant to an individual evaluation of the proposed subdivision.
(c) Proportionality Determination by City Engineer. Prior to a decision by the Planning and Zoning
Commission on a preliminary plat application, or if no preliminary plat application is authorized, on a final plat
application, the City Engineer shall prepare a report affirming that each public infrastructure improvement to be
imposed as a condition of plat approval is roughly proportionate to the demand created by the development on
the City's public facilities systems, taking into consideration the nature and extent of the development proposed.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 383/652
(1) In making his proportionality determination, the City Engineer may rely upon categorical
findings pertaining to on-site improvements; the proposed or potential use of the land; the timing and
sequence of development in relation to availability of adequate levels of public facilities; impact fee
studies or other studies that measure the demand for services created by the development and the
impact on the City's public facilities systems; the function of the public infrastructure improvements
in serving the proposed development; the degree to which public infrastructure improvements to
serve the subdivision are supplied by other developments; the anticipated participation by the City in
the costs of such improvements; any reimbursements for the costs of public infrastructure
improvements for which the proposed development is eligible; or any other information relating to
the mitigating effects of the public infrastructure improvements on the impacts created by the
development on the City's public facilities systems.
(2) Based upon his proportionality determination, the City Engineer shall affirm that the public
infrastructure improvement requirements of the Subdivision Regulations do not impose costs on the
developer for such improvements that exceed those roughly proportionate to those incurred by the
City in providing public facilities to serve the development.
(3) The City Engineer may promulgate any application requirements that may assist in making the
proportionality determination required by this subsection.
(d) Commission Determination. The Commission shall take into account the City's Engineer's report
concerning the proportionality of public infrastructure improvement requirements to be applied to a proposed
preliminary or final plat application, as the case may be, in making its decision on the plat application, and shall
identify any variation to the requirements that are to be included as conditions to plat approval.
(e) Appeals.
(1) Who May Appeal. An appeal to the City Council under this section may be filed by a property
owner or the applicant for a preliminary or final plat, in which a requirement to dedicate land for,
construct or pay a fee, other than an impact fee, for a public infrastructure improvement has been
applied or attached as a condition of approval, or as grounds for denying the plat application.
(2) Time for Filing and Request for Extension of Time. The appeal shall be filed in writing within
ten (10) days of the date the Planning and Zoning Commission takes action applying the public
infrastructure improvement requirement to the plat application. The appeal shall be filed with the
City Secretary and shall be forwarded to the City Council for consideration in conjunction with its
deliberations on the plat application. The applicant may request postponement of consideration of the
plat application by the City Council pending preparation of the study required by subsection (4), in
which case the applicant shall also waive the statutory period for deciding plats for the time needed to
decide the appeal by the City Council.
(3) Form of Appeal. An appeal under this section shall allege that application of the standard or the
imposition of conditions relating to the dedication, construction or fee requirement is not roughly
proportional to the nature and extent of the impacts created by the proposed development on the
City's public facilities systems, or does not reasonably benefit the proposed development.
(4) Study Required. The appellant shall provide a study in support of the appeal that includes the
following information within 30 days of the date of appeal, unless a longer time is requested:
a. Total capacity of the City's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park system to be
utilized by the proposed development, employing standard measures of capacity and
equivalency tables relating the type of development proposed to the quantity of system capacity
to be consumed by the development. If the proposed development is to be developed in phases,
such information also shall be provided for the entire development proposed, including any
phases already developed.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 384/652
b. Total capacity to be supplied to the City's water, wastewater, roadway, drainage or park
facilities system by the dedication of an interest in land, construction of improvements or fee
contribution. If the plat application is proposed as a phased development, the information shall
include any capacity supplied by prior dedication, construction or fee payments.
c. Comparison of the capacity of the City's public facilities system(s) to be consumed by the
proposed development with the capacity to be supplied to such system(s) by the proposed
dedication of an interest in land, construction of improvements, or fee payment. In making this
comparison, the impacts on the City's public facilities system(s) from the entire development
shall be considered.
d. The amount of any City participation in the costs of oversizing the public infrastructure
improvement to be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements.
e. Any other information that shows the alleged disproportionality between the impacts
created by the proposed development and the dedication, construction or fee requirement
imposed by the City.
(f) Land in Extraterritorial Jurisdiction. Where the subdivision or the public infrastructure improvements are
located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City and are to be dedicated to a county under an interlocal
agreement under Tex. Loc. Gov't Code ch. 242, an appeal or study in support of the appeal shall not be accepted
as complete for filing by the planning and zoning administrator unless the appeal or study is accompanied by
verification that a copy has been delivered to the county in which the facilities are to be located.
(g) Processing Application. The City Engineer shall evaluate the appeal and supporting study and shall make a
recommendation to the City Council based upon the information contained in the study, any comments received
from the county, and the City Engineer's analysis based upon the same factors considered in making his original
proportionality determination. Where the appeal is for relief from dedication of rights-of-way for or construction
of a facility in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction that is to be dedicated to a county under an interlocal
agreement under Texas Local Government Code, Chapter 242, the City Engineer shall coordinate a
recommendation with the county responsible for reviewing plats in the county.
(h) Decision. The City Council shall decide the appeal in conjunction with its decision on the plat application.
The Council shall base its decision on the criteria listed in subsection (h) [(i)], and may take one of the following
actions.
(1) Deny the appeal, and impose the standard or condition on the plat application in accordance
with the City Engineer's recommendation or the Planning and Zoning Commission's decision on the
plat; or
(2) Deny the appeal, upon finding that the proposed dedication, construction or fee requirements
are inadequate to offset the impacts of the subdivision on the public facilities system for water,
wastewater, roadway, drainage or park improvements, and either deny the plat application or require
that additional public infrastructure improvements be made as a condition of approval of the
application; or
(3) Grant the appeal, and waive in whole or in part any dedication, construction or fee requirement
for public infrastructure improvements to the extent necessary to achieve proportionality; or
(4) Grant the appeal, and direct that the City participate in the costs of acquiring land for or
constructing the public infrastructure improvement under standard participation policies.
(i) Criteria for Approval. In deciding an appeal under this section, the City Council shall determine whether
the application of the standard or condition requiring dedication of an interest in land for, construction of, or
payment of a fee for public infrastructure improvements is roughly proportional to the nature and extent of the
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 385/652
impacts created by the proposed subdivision on the City's public facilities systems for water, wastewater,
roadway, drainage or park facilities, and reasonably benefits the development. In making such determination, the
Council shall consider the evidence submitted by the appellant, the City Engineer's report and recommendation,
considering in particular the factors identified in subsection (c), and, where the property is located within the
City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, any recommendations from the county.
(j) Action Following Decision. If the relief requested under the proportionality appeal is granted in whole or
in part by the City Council, the dedication, construction or fee requirement initially imposed by the Planning and
Zoning Commission as a condition of plat approval shall be modified accordingly, and the standards applied or
the conditions attached to Commission's approval of the plat application shall be conformed to the relief granted.
Thereafter, the appellant shall resubmit the plat application to the City Council within ninety (90) days of the
date relief under the appeal is granted, in whole or in part, showing conformity with the City Council's decision
on the appeal.
(k) Expiration of Relief. If an applicant for plat approval prevails on a proportionality appeal, but fails to
conform the plat to the relief granted by the City Council with the ninety-day period provided, the relief granted
by the City Council on the appeal shall expire.
(1) The Council may extend the time for filing the revised plat application for good cause shown,
but in any event, the expiration date for the relief granted shall not be extended beyond one year from
the date relief was granted on the appeal.
(2) If the plat application is modified to increase the number of residential units or the intensity of
nonresidential uses, the responsible official may require a new study to validate the relief granted by
the City Council.
(3) If the plat application for which relief was granted is denied on other grounds, a new petition
for relief shall be required on any subsequent application.
Section 2-9 Determination of Vested Rights
(a) Vested Rights Petition
(1) Purpose. The purpose of a vested rights petition is to determine whether one or more standards
of these subdivision regulations should not be applied to a plat application because state law requires
that former standards be applied to the application.

Section 2-11 Revisions to Recorded Plats [Reserved]
Article III. Subdivision Standards
Section 3-1. Adequate Public Facilities Policy
(a) Adequate Service for Areas Proposed for Development. Land proposed for development in the City and in
the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction must be served adequately by essential public facilities and services,
including water facilities, wastewater facilities, roadway and pedestrian facilities, drainage facilities and park
facilities. Land shall not be approved for platting or development unless and until adequate public facilities
necessary to serve the development exist or provision has been made for the facilities, whether the facilities are
to be located within the property being developed or off-site.
(1) New development must be supported by adequate levels of public facilities and services.
(2) It is necessary and desirable to provide for dedication of rights-of-way and easements for
capital improvements to support new development at the earliest stage of the development process.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 389/652
(3) Requirements for dedication and construction of public infrastructure improvements to serve a
proposed new development should be attached as conditions of approval of any development
application that contains a specific layout of the development.
(4) There is an essential nexus between the demand on public facilities systems created by a new
development and the requirement to dedicate rights-of-way and easements and to construct capital
improvements to offset such impacts.
(5) The City desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated through contributions of
rights-of-way, easements and construction of capital improvements, and that development projects
contribute not more than its proportionate share of such costs.
(b) Conformance to Plans. Proposed capital improvements serving new development shall conform to and be
properly related to the public facilities elements of the City's adopted Master Plan, other adopted master plans
for public facilities and services, and applicable capital improvements plans, and shall meet the service levels
specified in such plans.
(c) Adequacy for Specific Facilities.
(1) Water. All lots, tracts or parcels on which development is proposed shall be connected to a
public water system which has capacity to provide water for domestic use and fire protection.
Additional standards and requirements are defined in Section 3-2 of these subdivision regulations.
(2) Wastewater. All lots, tracts or parcels on which development is proposed shall be served by an
approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The City Engineer shall be responsible for
determining the approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. The City may require the
phasing of development and/or improvements in order to maintain adequate wastewater capacity.
Additional standards and requirements are defined in Section 3-2 of these subdivision regulations.
(3) Roads. Proposed roads serving new development shall provide a safe, convenient and
functional system for vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation and shall be properly related to the
applicable master thoroughfare plan and any amendments thereto, and shall be appropriate for the
particular traffic characteristics of each proposed subdivision or development. New developments
shall be supported by a thoroughfare network having adequate capacity, and safe and efficient traffic
circulation. Each development shall have adequate access to the thoroughfare network. Additional
standards and requirements are defined in Section 3-3 of these subdivision regulations.
(4) Drainage. Drainage improvements serving new development shall accommodate potential
runoff from the entire upstream drainage area under developed conditions and shall be designed to
prevent overloading the capacity of the downstream drainage system. The City may require the
phasing of development, the use of control methods such as retention or detention, the construction of
off-site drainage improvements, or drainage impact fees in order to mitigate the impacts of the
proposed development. Additional standards and requirements are defined in Section 3-4 of these
subdivision regulations.
(c) City Options. In order to maintain prescribed levels of public facilities and services for the health, safety
and general welfare of its citizens, the City may require the dedication of easements and rights-of-way for or
construction of on-site or off-site public infrastructure improvements for water, wastewater, road, or drainage to
serve a proposed development, or authorize the payment of fees in lieu thereof. If adequate levels of public
facilities and services cannot be provided concurrent with the schedule of development proposed, the City may
deny the development until the public facilities and services can be provided, or require that the development be
phased so that the delivery of facilities and services coincides with the demands for the facilities created by the
development. The City may impose any conditions relating the provision of public infrastructure specified by an
ordinance establishing or amending the zoning for the property.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 390/652
(d) Property Owner's Responsibility
(1) Dedication and Construction of Improvements. The property owner shall dedicate all rights-ofway
and easements for, and shall construct capital improvements within the rights-of-way or
easements for those water, wastewater, road or drainage improvements needed to adequately serve a
proposed development consistent with the applicable master facilities plans, whether the facilities are
located on, adjacent to or outside the boundaries of the property being developed.
(2) Facilities Impact Studies. The City may require that a property owner prepare a comprehensive
traffic impact study, drainage study or other public facilities study in order to assist the City in
determining whether a proposed development will be supported with adequate levels of public
facilities and services concurrent with the demand for the facilities created by the development. The
study shall identify at a minimum the adequacy of existing facilities and the nature and extent of any
deficiencies, and the capital improvements needed to meet the adopted level of service assuming
development at the intensity proposed in the development application. The study shall be subject to
approval by the City Engineer. The City also may require, at the time of approval of a subsequent
development application, an update of a public facilities study approved in connection with a priority
development application.
(e) Timing of Dedication and Construction
(1) Initial Provision for Dedication or Construction. The City shall require an initial demonstration
that a proposed development shall be adequately served by public facilities and services at the time
for approval of the first development application that portrays a specific plan of development,
including but not limited to a petition for establishing a planned development zoning district, or other
overlay zoning district; a petition for an annexation agreement or a development agreement; an
application for a master plat, or an application for a preliminary or final plat. As a condition of
approval of the development application, the City may require provision for dedication of rights-ofway
or easements for, and construction of, capital improvements to serve the proposed development.
(2) Deferral of Obligation. The obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to construct one or more
capital improvements to serve a new development may be deferred until approval of a subsequent
phase of the subdivision, at the sole discretion of the City Engineer, upon written request of the
property owner, or at the City's own initiative. As a condition of deferring the obligation, the City
shall require that the developer enter into a subdivision improvements agreement, specifying the time
for dedication of rights-of-way for or construction of capital improvements serving the development.
Section 3-2 Utility Connection Regulations
(a) Adequate Water for Domestic Use and Fire Protection. It shall be the policy of the city to ensure that all
future subdivisions within the city and the extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be provided with the water in
sufficient volume and pressure for domestic use and fire protection, provided that where the land to be platted
lies within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City and the City is not the water supplier, the City Council may
grant a waiver to the requirement for adequate fire protection if it finds that (1) the proposed subdivision will
meet the land development rules and regulations of the county in which the property is located; (2) the
subdivision is to be served solely by on-site sewage disposal systems; and (3) water lines and other water
facilities serving the site are designed and sized to carry future fire flows under the City's criteria and meets all
City design and construction standards. The approval of a plat by the City does not constitute any representation,
however, does not constitute any representation, assurance or guarantee by the City of the adequacy and
availability of water for domestic use and fire protection within such plat.
(b) Water and Wastewater Utilities Connections. The City shall not provide any water or wastewater utility
connection to land proposed for division until all of the following requirements have been met:
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 391/652
(1) The water supply, treatment, storage and off-site distribution system to serve the subdivision
meet the requirements of subsection (c).
(2) The wastewater treatment and collection system to serve the subdivision meet the requirements
of subsection (d).
(3) The owner and/or developer of the subdivision or addition has executed a written agreement
with the city, providing for the off-site extension of water and sewer mains to serve the development,
in accordance with the existing water and wastewater extension regulations.
(4) Off-site mains have been extended to the subdivision pursuant to the agreement and this
section, and water and wastewater mains have been installed in accordance with the City's
specification in the block facing the street on which the property is situated and accepted by the city.
“As Built” plans will be required at the end of construction showing the actual location of all
improvements.
(c) Adequate Water System.
(1) No plat application shall be approved unless the subdivider demonstrates that there will be a
sufficient volume and pressure for domestic use and fire protection to serve the subdivision
concurrent with development. The water system serving the subdivision shall be deemed adequate
under the following circumstances:
a. To compute demand created from development, a maximum daily flow of 600 gpcd
(gallons per capita per day) and a maximum hourly flow of 1000 gpcd shall be used for
residential uses. For commercial and industrial uses, a maximum daily flow of 3000 gpad
(gallons per acre per day) and a maximum hourly flow of 6000 gpad shall be used.
b. Minimum system pressure shall be 35 psi.
c. Fire flow required shall be determined in accordance with the adopted City Fire Code. The
minimum allowable pressures during a fire flow condition are 20 pounds per square inch (“psi”)
residual at the fire hydrant and 35 psi elsewhere in the water distribution system.
d. The minimum ground storage requirements are 100 gallons per connection and for
elevated storage 100 gallons per connection or as determined based on Total Elevated Required
Storage Volume = (maximum hour demand minus maximum day demand) times drawdown
time (6 hours) per connection and Total Ground Required Storage Volume = maximum day
demand times drawdown time (6 hours) per connection.
e. Where the City is not the supplier, the subdivider must provide assurance of sufficient
capacity in accordance with the standards in this subsection from the entity holding the
Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the land to be subdivided. Such entity must have a
wholesale water supply contract that allows purchase of water at sufficient volumes to serve the
development considering all other commitments in accordance with City standards.
(2) Where City distribution mains are to be used for supplying water, there is an existing
distribution main with adequate capacity to serve the development within one-half mile of the
boundary of the proposed subdivision, and the subdivider agrees to extend an approach main from
such main to the subdivision of a size sufficient to serve the development or of a size shown in the
City's master water plan, whichever is larger, at his expense in accordance with standard City
participation policies. This requirement does not apply where the approach main is part of a funded
capital improvement project that the City has initiated consistent with its adopted capital
improvements plan for water facilities. Where the City is not the water supplier, the subdivider shall

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 392/652
provide assurances that water mains shall be extended to serve the subdivision prior to the time of
final plat approval for the second phase of a master plat.
(3) The subdivider shall demonstrate that the water system serving the development, other than
approach mains to connect the development to the water distribution system, will be adequate to
serve the development at the time of preliminary plat approval. Where a master plat is proposed, the
subdivider shall demonstrate that each phase of the development shall be served by an adequate water
system under this standard. The approach main shall be extended to serve the entire development
subject to a master plat prior to the time of final plat approval for the second phase of the master plat,
unless the extension is part of a funded capital improvement project that the City has initiated
consistent with its adopted capital improvements plan for water facilities.
(d) Adequate Wastewater System
(1) No plat application shall be approved unless the subdivider demonstrates that there will be an
adequate wastewater system to serve the subdivision concurrent with development. The wastewater
system serving the development shall be deemed adequate under the following circumstances:
a. To compute demand created from development, sewage flows shall be based on an average
daily unit flow of 278 gallons per day per unit (gpd/unit) for treatment plant flows.
b. For the collection system, the 2-hour peak wet weather flow using a peaking factor
determined by using Curve A in the American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) handbook
shall be used.
c. Adequacy of treatment facilities cannot be demonstrated by reliance upon temporary
package treatment plants.
d. Where the City's wastewater system is not to be used, the subdivider must provide
assurance that the entity collecting the sewage holds a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity
for the land to be subdivided, that collection systems are adequate to accommodate sewage
flows from the development and that the treatment system to be used has adequate capacity in
accordance with the standards in this subsection.
(2) Where City collection mains are to be used for collecting sewage, there is an existing collection
main with adequate capacity to serve the development within one-half mile of the boundary of the
proposed subdivision, and the subdivider agrees to extend such main to the subdivision of a size
sufficient to serve the development or of a size shown in the City's master wastewater plan,
whichever is larger, including construction of all necessary lift stations and force mains, at his
expense in accordance with standard City participation policies. This requirement does not apply
where the approach main is part of a funded capital improvement project that the City has initiated
consistent with its adopted capital improvements plan for wastewater facilities. Where the City is not
collecting the sewage, the subdivider shall provide assurances that wastewater mains shall be
extended to serve the subdivision prior to the time of final plat approval for the second phase of a
master plat.
(3) The subdivider shall demonstrate that the wastewater system serving the development, other
than approach mains to connect the development to the sanitary sewer collection system, will be
adequate at the time of preliminary plat approval. Where a master plat is proposed, the subdivider
shall demonstrate that each phase of the development shall be served by an adequate wastewater
system under this standard. The approach main shall be extended to serve the entire development
subject to a master plat prior to the time of final plat approval for the second phase of the master plat,
unless the extension is part of a funded capital improvement project that the City has initiated
consistent with its adopted capital improvements plan for wastewater facilities.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 393/652
(e) Adequacy Where Utility Connection Not Required.
(1) Where the source of the water supply for the proposed subdivision is groundwater under the
land to be subdivided, the subdivider shall submit a certification prepared by an engineer or
geoscientist licensed to practice in Texas that the groundwater supply is adequate to serve the
subdivision in accordance with the standards in subsection (c).
(2) Where the installation of wastewater facilities is not proposed or required, the size of the
subdivided lots shall meet the minimum lot size standards of the zoning district in which the land is
located, and the City's minimum lot size requirements for individual disposal facilities for land inside
city limits, and the minimum lot size requirements for individual disposal facilities for the County in
which the land is located for land in the City's extraterritorial jurisdiction. The lot shall be of
sufficient size for individual disposal facilities, including the necessary lateral lines, and subdivider
shall install individual disposal devices for each lot at the same time improvements are erected
thereon. Any such individual sewage disposal system shall be constructed in accordance with the
state health department specifications and subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
(f) Oversized Water and Wastewater Infrastructure. The City may participate in the cost of oversized water
and wastewater mains, lift stations and other facilities necessary to serve a proposed subdivision. “Oversized
mains” are mains with pipe sizes larger than eight (8) inches in diameter, which are required by the City for
future expansion of the water and wastewater systems in conformance with the City's master water and
wastewater plans and that are not required to provide adequate service to the proposed subdivision. “Oversized
lift stations and other facilities” are facilities with capacity in excess of that required to provide adequate service
to the proposed subdivision, in conformance with the City's master water and wastewater plans. Prior to
beginning construction of any facility for which the City is to participate in the cost thereof, the developer and
the City shall enter into a subdivision improvement agreement, in accordance with section 2-5.
(g) Pro Rata Fees. A subdivider or property owner that agrees to construct a water or wastewater main or an
associated facility that on acceptance will become part of the City's water and wastewater system and which
supplies capacity to other existing or new developments, may apply to the City to establish pro rata fees to be
paid by other users of the facilities and to reimburse the subdivider or property owner a proportional amount of
the costs of constructing such improvements.
(1) Study Required. The amount of the cost reimbursement from pro rata fees for an improvement,
if any, shall be based on engineering cost estimates agreed upon in writing by the City Engineer and
the applicant, and verified in a study provided by the applicant. The study shall aggregate the costs of
associated improvements where feasible. The City may establish guidelines for eligible costs to
administer the policy in this section. The study shall contain the following minimum elements:
a. identification of the area and all properties to be served by the water or wastewater lines or
associated facilities to be installed;
b. identification of the costs of the facilities to be installed;
c. apportionment of the costs of the facilities to be installed among lots, tracts or parcels to be
served by the improvements, based upon capacity to be utilized by such properties, using
accepted engineering standards and practices;
d. calculation of the maximum amount of the costs which are to be reimbursed to the
subdivider or property owner, net of costs attributable to the subdivider's or property owner's
utilization of capacity of the lines or associated facilities; and
e. calculation of a pro rata fee to be charged per unit of land that is to be connected to the
water or wastewater lines or associated facilities.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 394/652
(2) Approval Process
a. The City Engineer shall review each request for cost reimbursement from pro rata fees.
b. The City Engineer may approve the study for cost reimbursement from pro rata fees, with
or without modifications, only if he determines that:
(i) The property to be served is in the water CCN area of the City, but has not been
included on the impact fee capital improvements plan for that category of capital
improvement;
(ii) the size of each proposed line or facility complies with the generally accepted
engineer practices and other planning criteria of the City and final design and routing will
comply with the TCSS Manual;
(iii) the study proposing pro rata fees fairly apportions the extension costs among
prospective users of the facilities to be installed; and
(iv) The proposed line or facility is a reasonable extension or addition to the water and
wastewater utility system.
c. Requests which are not approved by the City Engineer, may be presented to the City
Council for further consideration[.]
d. Upon approval of the request for reimbursement from pro rata fees, any development on or
user of property identified in the approved fee study thereafter that connects to or utilizes the
capacity of the water or wastewater line or associated facility for which a pro rata fee has been
established shall pay the applicable fee. Pro rata fees shall be collected by the City before
construction commences on any water or wastewater improvements to serve such land or before
connection to the facility, whichever first occurs.
(3) Payment of Pro Rata Fees
a. For a period of ten (10) years following the City's acceptance of the water line, wastewater
line, or associated facility, the subdivider or property owner shall be entitled to reimbursement
from the proceeds of the pro rata fees established pursuant to this section, up to the maximum
amount of the reimbursement established in the approved pro rata fee study. The City may
deduct two (2) percent of the amount of pro rata fees collected from the amount of the fees
reimbursed to the subdivider or property owner as an administration fee.
b. The City may establish one or more pro rata fee accounts for purposes of administering the
policies of this section. The City shall deposit all pro rata fees collected pursuant to this section
into such account(s). Expenditures from such accounts shall be earmarked solely for
reimbursement of subdividers or property owners for the installation of water lines or
wastewater lines or associated facilities for which pro rata fees have been established pursuant
to this section.
Section 3-3. Road Adequacy Regulations.
(a) Purpose and General Policy.
(1) New development within the urbanizing area must be supported by an adequate network of
thoroughfares.
(2) Thoroughfares are an essential component of the City's street network and are necessary to
accommodate the continuing growth and development of the City.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 395/652
(3) It is necessary and desirable to obtain rights-of-way for off-site, abutting and internal
thoroughfares to support new development at the time of platting or development of the land.
(4) There must be rough proportionality between the traffic impacts created by a new development
and requirements placed on the property owner to dedicate and improve off-site, abutting and internal
thoroughfare rights-of-way to City standards.
(5) The City desires to assure both that development impacts are mitigated through contributions of
thoroughfare rights-of-way and improvements and that a development project contribute not more
than its fair share of thoroughfare costs.
(6) It is the City's intent to institute a procedure to assure that mandatory dedications of
thoroughfare rights-of-way and thoroughfare construction requirements are proportional to the traffic
demands created by a new development.
(7) It is the intent of the City that a road adequacy determination be made prior to approval of
subdivision applications.
(b) Minimum Road Standards.
(1) Applicability. All subdivision applications shall provide for adequate roads to support proposed
development through compliance with the following minimum standards governing dedication and
improvement of internal and adjacent thoroughfares. For purposes of this section adjacent
thoroughfares shall include thoroughfares abutting the proposed subdivision, whether located within
the boundaries of the subdivision or within public rights-of-way.
(2) Standards and Specifications. The property owner shall dedicate and improve all rights-of-way
for internal and adjacent thoroughfares required by these regulations in accordance with the
classification of streets contained within the City's adopted thoroughfare plan.
(3) Dedication and Improvement of Internal and Adjacent Thoroughfares. Dedication and
improvement of internal and adjacent thoroughfares. For adjacent thoroughfares, the property owner
shall dedicate and improve one-half of the right-of-way necessary to meet the specifications in the
Royse City Strategic Plan and Master Thoroughfare Plan. The City may require additional land and
improvements for rights-of-way for adjacent thoroughfares where necessary to achieve adequacy of
the road network and where such additional land and improvements are proportional to the traffic
impacts generated by the proposed subdivision, depending on factors such as the impact of the
development on the thoroughfare, the timing of development in relation to need for the thoroughfare,
and the likelihood that adjoining property will develop in a timely manner. In the case of adjacent
frontage or service roads for state and federally designated highways, the property owner shall
dedicate sufficient right-of-way and make authorized improvements in order to provide an adequate
road network to serve the subdivision.
(4) Substandard Street Improvements. Where an existing thoroughfare that does not meet the City's
right-of-way or design standards abuts a proposed new development, the City may require the
property owner to dedicate the right-of-way for a standard thoroughfare width, and to improve the
street according to the dimensions and specifications in the thoroughfare plan, depending on factors
such as the impact of the development on the thoroughfare, the timing of development in relation to
need for the thoroughfare, and the likelihood that adjoining property will develop in a timely manner.
(5) Capital Improvements Plan for Roads. A road improvement may be considered adequate for a
subdivision application if the required improvement is included, funded, and approved in the City's,
County's or State's two-year capital improvements plan for roads, or if the improvement is included,
funded, and approved in the City's, County's or State's three- to five-year capital improvements plan
for roads, provided that the applicant agrees to phase development to conform to such scheduled
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 396/652
improvement. This section shall not be construed to prevent the City from requiring dedication of
rights-of-way for such roads, or from assigning trips to such roads in a traffic impact study in order to
determine a development project's proportionate costs of improvements.
(6) Participation in costs of improvements. The City may participate in the costs of improvements
required by this section in order to achieve proportionality between the traffic impacts created by the
proposed development and the obligation to provide adequate roadways. In such cases, the property
owner shall be responsible for the entire initial costs of road improvements, including design costs.
Reimbursement of the City's agreed share of the costs shall be made as funds become available. The
construction of improvements and the provisions for participation in costs by the City shall be
included in a subdivision improvement agreement.
(c) Traffic Impact Analysis
(1) Applicability. This section applies to any nonresidential subdivision application for which
proposed development generates traffic in excess of 1000 average daily trips, based upon the latest
edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual. In the event that
land uses for the development are not specified at the time of subdivision application, the daily trip
generation rate shall be computed based upon the maximum land use intensity allowed under the
comprehensive plan for the land to be subdivided.
(2) TIA Required. Every subdivision application for a proposed development that generates traffic
in excess of 1000 average daily trips, shall be accompanied by a traffic impact analysis based on the
ITE Manual, prepared in accordance with standard transportation engineering practices for purposes
of determining the adequacy of the road network to serve the proposed development, and whether
off-site road dedication and improvements should be made to mitigate the effects of the development
proposed in the subdivision application.
a. An initial traffic impact analysis shall be submitted with the master plat or first subdivision
application for the development. An updated traffic impact analysis shall be submitted with
each final plat submitted for approval and shall be generally consistent with the initial traffic
impact analysis. The initial traffic impact analysis shall be updated whenever the master plat is
modified to authorize more intensive development.
b. The traffic impact analysis shall determine (1) trips to be generated by the proposed
development; (2) assignment of such trips to the road network analyzed; (3) the capacity of
affected thoroughfares before and after the proposed development; (4) specific
recommendations for thoroughfare improvements and traffic-control modifications needed to
mitigate the traffic from the proposed development and (5) the development project's
proportionate share of the costs of such improvements and modifications.
(3) City evaluation and action. The City shall evaluate the adequacy of the traffic impact analysis
prepared by the applicant. Based upon such evaluation, the City shall determine (1) whether the
application may be approved in the absence of dedication of rights-of-way or construction of
improvements to each affected thoroughfare and (2) the extent of the applicant's obligations to make
such dedications or improvements. The City shall condition the approval of the subdivision
application on one or more of the following performances by the applicant:
a. delay or phasing of development until thoroughfares with adequate capacity or intersection
improvements is constructed;
b. a reduction in the density or intensity of the proposed development sufficient to assure that
the road network has adequate capacity to accommodate the additional traffic to be generated
by the development;
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 397/652
c. the dedication or construction of thoroughfares or traffic-control improvements needed
mitigate the traffic impacts generated by the proposed development.
(4) Deferral of Obligation. Upon request of the applicant or property owner, the obligation to
dedicate or improve thoroughfare rights-of-way or to make intersection improvements imposed on a
subdivision application may be deferred to a later stage of the development process. As a condition of
deferring the obligation to dedicate rights-of-way for or to improve thoroughfares, which deferral
shall be in the sole discretion of the City, the City shall require the developer to execute a subdivision
improvement agreement specifying the amount and timing of the rights-of-way dedication or
improvements to thoroughfares.
(5) Cash contributions. In lieu of the obligation to dedicate or improve thoroughfares or make
traffic-control improvements to achieve road adequacy, the applicant may propose to make
equivalent cash contributions based upon the development project's proportionate share of the costs
of improvements, which the City in its sole discretion may accept in satisfaction of road adequacy
standards in this section. Any funds accepted by the City shall be earmarked for construction of the
improvements for which the contribution was made.
(6) Options. Whenever the proposed development's share of the costs of a thoroughfare or trafficcontrol
improvement needed to mitigate traffic generated by the development is less than 100%, the
City in its sole discretion may do the following:
a. participate in the excess costs for one or more improvements; or
b. aggregate the costs of improving multiple thoroughfares or intersections identified in the
traffic impact analysis, and require improvements to only some of the thoroughfares or
intersections affected by the development.
Section 3-4. Drainage Adequacy Regulations
(a) System Improvements. Storm drainage facilities shall include all elements of a drainage system consisting
of streets, alleys, storm drains, channels, culverts, bridges, swales and any other facility through which or over
which stormwater flows, all of which the City must have a right in, either in the form of a dedicated right-ofway,
floodway or drainage easements. The developer shall be responsible for the necessary facilities to provide
drainage patterns and drainage controls such that properties within the drainage area, whether upstream or
downstream of the development, are not adversely affected by storm drainage from facilities on the
development. Drainage facilities shall be designed and constructed at such locations and of such size and
dimensions to adequately serve the development and the contributing drainage area above the development. The
developer shall provide all the necessary easements and right-of-ways required for drainage structures including
storm drains and open channels, lined or unlined.
(1) Easement widths for storm drain pipelines shall not be less than fifteen (15) feet, and easement
widths for open channels shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wider than the top width of the channel. In
all cases, easements shall be of an adequate size to allow proper maintenance.
(2) Storm drainage released from the site will be discharged to a natural watercourse or storm
sewer system of an adequate size to convey the 100-year storm runoff expected after development.
(3) An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets, pipes and other underground structures
with approved outlets shall be constructed where runoff of stormwater and the prevention of erosion
cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage facilities. Areas subject to flood conditions
or inadvertent stormwater retention, such as standing or pooling water, as established by the City
Engineer, will not be considered for development until adequate drainage has been provided.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 398/652
(b) Creeks. All creeks and drainage areas shall be preserved and protected in their natural condition wherever
possible, unless significant storm drainage improvements are required by the City in these areas. All
development adjacent to creeks and drainage areas shall be in accordance with the City's TCSS Manual, and
with any other City policies or ordinances related to public access or recreational use of waterways.
(c) Oversizing. Off-site improvements may be required to carry the additional flows caused by the proposed
development. The developer shall be fully responsible for the construction of off-site drainage improvements
necessary to serve the subdivision or development and the surrounding area, unless other arrangements are
approved by the City Council and subject to cost participation by the City.
Section 3-5 Water System Design Standards
(a) General Requirements. The design and construction of the water distribution system to serve the
development shall be in accordance with good engineering principles, with the standards in this section, the
Standard Specifications for Construction and the TCSS Manual and with the requirements of the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). All off-site water mains shall be sized and located to conform
to projected demands in accordance with the current Water Master Plan and the computer model with regard to
the impact of each development on the existing and proposed water distribution system. No construction shall
commence prior to the approval of the plans and specifications by the City.
(b) Size of Mains. All facilities shall be of sufficient size to provide adequate capacity for ultimate
development. The pipelines shall be sized to meet the maximum instant domestic requirements plus an
appropriate allowance for fire protection water. The design criteria for water demand shall be submitted to the
City with the plans and specifications. The City reserves the right to require larger pipelines than required for the
proposed development in order to provide capacities for areas outside the development. The developer will be
responsible for construction of water lines adjacent to his property in accordance with the latest Water Master
Plan or as required by the City Engineer.
(1) The minimum pipeline size to serve residential areas shall be six inches (6") in diameter, and
the minimum pipeline size serving commercial, business, industrial, etc. shall be eight inches (8").
(2) In general, all lines shall be looped with no dead-ends. Dead-end lines will be allowed only
upon approval by the City and shall be furnished with a flush valve arrangement.
(c) Connections to Existing Distribution System. Connections to the City's existing system will be allowed
only at locations where there is sufficient quantity and pressures available to meet the projected requirements of
the development. In general, the connections to the existing distribution system shall be made in such a manner
to keep “shut-downs” to a minimum. Preference should be given to a tapping valve connection.
(d) Oversizing. In a proposed development where City water is not adjacent to the property but is accessible,
the developer shall provide, at his expense, an off-site water main of sufficient size to serve his development or
as shown on the City's Water Master Plan, whichever is larger. The City may participate in the costs of
oversizing or establish pro rata fees for the oversize of the required line. The City participation must be approved
by the City Council.
Section 3-6 Wastewater System Design Standards
(a) General Requirements. The design and construction of the wastewater collection system to serve the
development shall be in accordance with good engineering principles, standards in this section, the Standard
Specifications for Construction, the TCSS Manual and the requirements of the TCEQ. No construction shall
commence prior to the approval of the plans and specifications by the City of Royse City. All wastewater mains
and lift stations shall be sized and located to conform to the projected flows in accordance with the latest
sanitary Wastewater Master Plan.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 399/652
(b) Size of Mains. All facilities shall be of sufficient size to provide adequate capacity for the ultimate
development. The wastewater lines shall be sized to meet the peak-day dry weather flow plus an appropriate
allowance for infiltration of stormwater. The minimum wastewater main size for all developments shall be six
inches (6") in diameter. The design criteria and calculation shall be submitted to the City with the plans and
specifications. The City may require oversizing of a main in order to provide capacities for areas outside of the
development.
(c) Connections to Existing Wastewater Collection System. In a proposed development where City wastewater
facilities are not adjacent to the property but are accessible, the developer shall provide, at his expense, an offsite
wastewater interceptor of sufficient size to serve his development and the contributing service area (using
fully developed flows).
(d) Oversizing of Lift Stations and Force Mains. All lift station design plans and specifications shall be
submitted to the City Engineer and TCEQ for review and approval prior to construction. Developments which
increase the flow to existing lift stations will be subject to a pro rata fee if sufficient capacity is available in the
existing lift station or will be required to increase the capacity of the existing facility if sufficient capacity is not
available. Lift stations and force mains shall be designed and built for the upstream drainage area assuming fully
developed conditions. This will include off-site areas if applicable. Developers are responsible for the
construction of regional lift stations and force mains, per the Wastewater Master Plan. Developers may request
establishment of pro rata fees for oversizing of lift stations and force mains, in accordance with the provisions of
section 3-2(g).
Section 3-7 Street Design Standards
(a) General Requirements. The arrangement, alignment and layout of all streets shall conform to the design
principles and goals of the City of Royse City Strategic Master Plan and Thoroughfare Plan, and shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets or driveways (whether within the City of Royse City,
within its ETJ area, or within adjacent municipal or County areas), to topographical conditions, to public safety,
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The following shall
be considered when approving designs and layouts of local streets in the interior of subdivisions:
(1) Collector and local streets within residential subdivisions, including the placement of cul-desacs,
shall be designed in agreement with the “Neighborhood Concept” as presented in the City of
Royse City Strategic Master Plan, and shall contain, where feasible, the curvilinear characteristics
defined in Chapter 2 Growth Strategies and Design Approaches. Consequently, cul-de-sacs shall be
considered as being an appropriate application within the curvilinear design pattern of subdivisions.
(2) Collector streets shall be required to provide connections to adjacent undeveloped property to
facilitate neighborhood circulation.
(3) Grid street patterns may be permitted for New Urbanism or Neotraditional Development as
defined in said Chapter 2 Growth Strategies and Design Approaches.
(4) Streets shall be designed to conform to existing or proposed driveway openings (including
those on the other side of an existing or planned median-divided arterial, in which case new streets
shall align with such driveway openings such that median openings can be shared).
(5) To the greatest extent possible, the number of lots fronting along residential collector streets
shall be minimized in order to ensure adequate traffic safety and efficiency. No more than twenty
percent (20%) of the total centerline length of a collector street may have residential lots fronting
onto the collector on each side of the street.
(6) Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 400/652
(7) A cul-de-sac street shall not be longer than six hundred feet (600'), and at the closed end shall
have a turnaround bulb with an outside pavement diameter of at least eighty feet (80') and a right-ofway
diameter of at least one hundred feet (100'). The length of a cul-de-sac shall be measured from
the centerline of the intersecting street to the centerline of the cul-de-sac bulb.
(8) A street intersection with a major thoroughfare shall be at a ninety-degree (90°) angle and shall
be tangent to the intersecting street for at least one hundred feet (100'). All other street intersections
shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at a ninety-degree (90°) angle or radial to the
centerline of the intersecting street for the full right-of-way of the intersecting street, and tangent to
the intersecting street for at least fifty feet (50'). No street shall intersect at an angle that is less than
eighty-five degrees (85°).
(9) The applicant may receive relief from the design criteria of the curvilinear pattern in the event
that it is determined not to be feasible to develop in accordance with these design principles.
However, facts and data must be submitted supporting such relief and must be approved by the City
Council.
(b) Access. All subdivisions must have at least two (2) points of vehicular access, and must be connected via
improved roadways to the City's improved thoroughfare and street system by one or more approach roads of
such dimensions and improved to such standards as are hereinafter set forth. Requirements for dedication of
right-of-way and improvement of approach roads may be increased depending upon the size or density of the
proposed development, or if such need is demonstrated by traffic impact analysis.
(1) “Two (2) points of vehicular access” shall be construed to mean that the subdivision has at least
two (2) improved roads accessing the subdivision from the City's improved thoroughfare system, and
the subdivision has at least two (2) road entrances. The City Council may, at its discretion and upon a
finding that such will not compromise public safety or impede emergency access, accept a single
median-divided entrance from the City's improved thoroughfare system provided that the median
extends into the subdivision for an unbroken length of at least two hundred feet (200') to an
intersecting internal street which provides at least two (2) routes to the interior of the subdivision. For
example, the entrance street is not a dead-end or cul-de-sac, and it does not create a “bottleneck”
allowing only one emergency route into the interior of the subdivision.
(2) The subdivision shall be designed to provide adequate emergency access for public safety
vehicles. Each residential lot in the subdivision shall have a minimum frontage on a dedicated public
street as required by applicable zoning or thirty-five feet (35'), whichever is greater, unless other
provisions have been authorized through planned development approval.

Section 3-8 Drainage System Design Standards
(a) Stormwater Management Plan. All new subdivisions shall provide a complete stormwater management
plan as part of the final engineering drawings. The plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following: a
complete review of all on-site, upstream and downstream drainage within the impacted watershed; determination
of all on-site and downstream drainage facility improvements expected from the increased runoff from the
proposed development and future upstream and downstream developments; and calculations necessary to
determine compliance with the design standards in this section and the TCSS Manual. The plan shall assume
intensities of use allowed under current zoning or land uses identified in the future land use element of the
Comprehensive Plan (whichever generates the greatest stormwater runoff), with maximum development
considered throughout the watershed. The storm drainage plan shall show all necessary improvements with flow
data provided at each point of interception of water.
(1) As part of the stormwater management plan, the developer shall show a lot grading plan to
direct all water to proper intersection points avoiding cross flow of water from lot to lot.
(2) All upstream discharge shall be intercepted and carried through the proper intersection points
avoiding cross flow of water from lot to lot. All upstream discharge shall be intercepted and carried
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 402/652
through the proposed development in compliance with the standards in this section and the TCSS
Manual.
(b) Compliance Required. The developer shall provide plans and specifications and design calculations for all
drainage structures. The design, size, type and location of all storm drainage facilities shall be subject to the
approval of the City Engineer. The requirements set forth in the design standards and in the TCSS Manual are
considered minimum requirements. The developer and his engineer shall bear the total responsibility for the
adequacy of design. The design flows for the drainage system shall be calculated by the Rational Method in
accordance with the requirements set forth in this document. Curbs, inlets, manholes, etc. shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the TCSS Manual. Materials and construction procedures shall conform to the
requirements of the Standard Specifications for Construction.
(c) Lot Drainage and Grading Plan. All lots shall be graded at the time of development in accordance with the
lot drainage and grading plan. All grading shall not exceed a slope of 3 to 1 unless approved by the City
Engineer. In applicable situations, the City Engineer may require 4 to 1 slope or greater. The builder at the time
of permit application shall furnish a grading plan in compliance with the appropriate chapter of the building code
adopted by the City, the grading plan for the development and the storm drainage plan approved for that
particular development. If the re-grading of a lot is necessary, the builder shall be required to furnish a new
drainage plan indicating the diversion and rerouting of the affected stormwater. When the re-grading of a lot
prevents the drainage from flowing to the proper structures as designated in the drainage plan, then the builder
will furnish a registered engineer's review for adequacy of existing structures to which the water is diverted. If
improvements are necessary to provide for adequate drainage due to re-grading of a lot, then the improvement
must be made at the builder's expense before a grading permit or other permits for construction will be issued by
the City. The City Engineer will review the information submitted for compliance with the approved grading and
drainage management plan.
(d) Erosion Controls. Approved erosion controls shall be provided as part of the development construction on
any or all lots within the development to protect the drainage, lot development and adjacent property. All open
channels that are not concrete lined shall be designed to prevent erosion. Temporary erosion control methods
shall be used to abate sediment runoff from construction sites. The application of control devices can yield
significant water quality and drainage benefits at a minimal cost to the developer. The erosion control measures
can be grouped as barriers, filter devices, or routing devices.
(e) Easement widths for storm drain pipelines shall not be less than fifteen (15) feet, and easement widths for
open channels shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wider than the top width of the channel. In all cases, easements
shall be of an adequate size to allow proper maintenance.

(a) The minimum width for City utility easements shall be fifteen feet (15') or as otherwise required by the
City Engineer. The minimum width for City drainage easements shall be as required by the City Engineer. The
width of easements for other utility providers, such as for gas, electric, telephone or cable television, shall be as
required by that particular entity. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to determine appropriate easement
widths required by other utility companies. Wherever possible, easements shall be centered or along front or side
lot lines rather than across the interior or rear of lots, particularly where no alleys will be provided behind the
lots.
(b) Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway or channel, there shall be provided a
storm drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with such course and of such additional width
as may be designated by the City Engineer, subject to determination according to proper engineering
considerations. The required width shall conform to the requirements set forth by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and/or the City. Parallel streets or parkways
may be required adjacent to certain portions of creek or drainageways to provide maintenance access and/or
public access and visibility into public open space or recreation areas. The number of lots that back or side onto
creeks, drainageways, public parks and open spaces, and public school sites shall be limited as required to
provide public access, visibility, safety and security within these areas are maximized. Other utilities may be
permitted within a drainage or floodway easement only if approved by the City Engineer.
(c) The area of a lot shall be computed inclusive of all easements. However, there shall be a minimum
buildable area, exclusive of required easements, buffer zones and setbacks for each lot. The minimum buildable
area shall be an area one-half of the required minimum lot size, where applicable.
(d) Where alleys are not provided in a residential subdivision, a minimum ten-foot (10') utility easement shall
be provided along the front of all lots, adjacent to and flush with the street right-of-way line for the potential
placement of utility facilities.
(e) All necessary on-site easements shall be established on the subdivision plat and not by separate instrument,

residential lots shall have a minimum of thirty-five feet (35') of frontage, and nonresidential lots shall
have a minimum of fifty feet (50') of frontage, along a dedicated, improved street.
(c) Irregular-shaped lots shall have sufficient width at the building line to meet lot width and frontage
requirements, and shall provide a building pad without encroachment into front, side or rear yard setbacks or
into any type of easement. The rear width shall be sufficient to provide access for all necessary utilities,
including access for driveways and solid waste collection when alleys are present (minimum 20-foot alley
frontage). Triangular, greatly elongated or tapered, “flag” or “panhandle” lots shall be prohibited.
(d) Side lot lines shall be at ninety-degree (90°) angles or radial to street right-of-way lines to the greatest
extent possible.
(e) Double-frontage lots shall be prohibited, except where they may be essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arterials, or to overcome a specific disadvantage or hardship imposed by
topography or other factors. Where lots have double frontage, building setback lines shall be established for each
street side. A residential lot shall not back onto any residential street or collector street within a residential area
or neighborhood, and shall not have more than one-half of its perimeters along streets.

Section 3-12 Blocks
(a) The length, width and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
(1) Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use
contemplated;
(2) Zoning requirements as to lot sizes, setbacks and dimensions (if within the City's corporate
limits) or, where applicable, standards specified in a valid and approved development agreement; and
(3) Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic and for pedestrians
or bicyclists traveling to a public park or school site or other facility within or close to the
neighborhood.
(b) Intersecting streets, which determine the lengths and widths of blocks, shall be provided at such intervals
as to serve cross-traffic adequately, to provide adequate fire protection, and to conform to customary subdivision
practices. Where no existing subdivision or topographical constraints control, the blocks shall not be more than
twelve hundred feet (1200') in length; however, in cases where physical barriers or property ownership creates
conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be increased or decreased
(through approval of a waiver by the City Council) to meet the existing conditions having due regard for
connecting streets, circulation of traffic and public safety. Block arrangements must provide access to all lots.
Section 3-13 Perimeter Landscaping and Decorative Fences and Walls
(a) Perimeter Landscaping. Trees and shrubs shall be planted in the public rights-of-way of streets Identified
as being an arterial street and all collector streets within the subdivision and along its perimeter as follows:

Engineer shall be final for questions regarding traffic view or traffic safety.
Section 3-15 Park Land Dedication and In Lieu Fees
(a) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for neighborhood parks as a condition of subdivision
development in the City of Royse City. The City Council of the City of Royse City hereby finds as follows:
(1) Recreational areas, in the form of neighborhood parks, are necessary and in the public welfare,
and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into the
procedure for planning and developing property as a residential subdivision in the City of Royse City,
whether such development consists of new construction on previously vacant land or rebuilding and
redeveloping existing residential areas.
(2) Neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational
opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby.
(3) The cost of neighborhood parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners
who, by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks, shall be the primary beneficiaries of
such facilities.
(c) Authority. This section is enacted in accordance with the Home Rule powers of the City of Royse City,
granted under the Texas Constitution and statutes of the State of Texas.
(d) Applicability.
(1) This section shall apply to any division or development of land for residential use.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 406/652
(2) Any dedication for parks and public open space areas shall be clearly designated on the
preliminary plat and the final plat, and shall be subject to approval by the City's Park Board and by
the City Council.
(e) Developer's Obligation. Prior to a filing a final plat with the Clerk of the County in which the residential
development is located, the subdivider shall dedicate one (1) acre of land for neighborhood parks for each 75
proposed dwelling units, or pay an equivalent fee in lieu of dedication, as provided in subsection (g). As used in
this section, a “dwelling unit” means each individual residence, including individual residences in a multifamily
structure, designed and/or intended for inhabitation by a single family. Population shall be calculated based upon
2.75 persons per dwelling unit.
(f) Determination of Suitability. The City Council shall determine the suitability of land proposed to be
dedicated as a neighborhood park, upon the recommendation of the Parks Board, and taking into consideration
the following factors. If the City Council determines that land proposed for neighborhood park dedication is
unsuitable in whole or part, it may require payment of park fees in lieu of land dedication, as set forth in
subsection (g), require a combination of land dedication and payment of fees, or condition plat approval on a
different configuration of park land within the proposed development.
(1) Character of area:
(i) Any area primarily located in the 100-year floodplain.
(ii) Any areas of unusual topography or slope which renders same unusable for organized
recreational activities.
(iii) Drainage areas may be accepted as part of a park if the channel is to remain
predominantly in its natural state or constructed in accordance with City engineering standards,
if no significant area of the park is cut off from access by such channel, if not less than five (5)
acres of the site is above the 100-year floodplain, or if the dedication is in excess of ten (10)
acres, not more than fifty percent (50%) of the site should be included in the 100-year
floodplain.
(2) Size of park. For purpose of this section an area of land less than five (5) acres presumptively is
impractical for neighborhood park purposes.
(3) Access. Each park shall have pedestrian and vehicular access from one or more public streets.
Street frontage shall be required to assure public access to park land.
(4) Proximity of existing park land. Land dedication may be unsuitable if there are sufficient parks
already in the public domain for the area of the proposed development, or if the recreation potential
for that area would be better served by expanding or [of] existing neighborhood parks.
(5) Drainage. The park land shall have adequate drainage, as determined by the City Public Works
Director, who shall review all construction plans for any detention or retention proposed to be built
on the land to be dedicated.
(6) Trash removal. The subdivider shall remove all trash, refuse and waste materials from the
dedicated park land prior to acceptance by the City.
(g) Fees In Lieu of Land
(1) At the City Council's option, the subdivider or developer shall satisfy in whole or in part the
requirements of this section for neighborhood parks by paying a fee in lieu of land dedication. The
City Council from time to time may promulgate a schedule of in lieu fees. In the absence of a fee
schedule, the cash payment in lieu of land dedication per acres shall be determined by taking the fair
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 407/652
market value of one (1) acre of land, derived from the average of three separate, unimproved oneacre
parcels of land that are deemed to be comparable to the land being subdivided within reasonable
proximity to the land being platted.
(2) Such payment in lieu of land shall be made prior to final plat approval, or may be deferred until
the time of application for a building permit.
(h) Special Fund and Right to Refund
(1) All fees in lieu of dedication collected under this section shall be deposited in the City of Royse
City's Neighborhood Park Land Fund and used solely for the purchase, lease or other acquisition of
neighborhood park land, site preparation, and installation of utilities. All expenditures from the said
Fund shall be authorized by the City Council. Funds must be spent within one (1) mile of the
subdivision from which the fees are collected. In the event the City subsequently designates
neighborhood park benefit areas, existing funds may be reasonably allocated among such service
areas proportional to the benefits received and thereafter shall be earmarked for expenditure within
such benefit areas.
(2) The City of Royse City shall account for all fees paid into the Neighborhood Park Land Fund.
Any monies paid into the Fund must be expended by the City of Royse City within ten (10) years
from the date collected by the City. Such funds shall be considered to be spent on a first in, first out
basis in a particular park service area. If not so expended within the ten-year period, the owners of
the property will, on the last day of such period, be entitled to a refund of the remaining fees. The
current owners of the property within the subdivision must request such a refund within one (1) year
of entitlement, in writing, or such right is waived.
Section 3-16 Utilities Underground
All utilities within a residential development shall be placed underground. Utilities are defined for this purpose
as water pipelines, wastewater pipelines, stormwater pipelines, natural gas pipelines, telephone wires, cable TV
wires and electric wires. In case of special or unique circumstances, the City Council may grant waivers to this
requirement. Any request for a waiver should be submitted in writing to the City of Royse City setting forth the
justification.

(3) Upon receipt of a properly completed application, the utility official shall review such
application, and, if the utility official approves the same as being in compliance with this article, the
applicant's account shall be corrected in the following manner:
(A) If the applicant has a winter average, as that term is defined in section 13.03.002(c) of

within 60 days after the city sends the customer the water bill on which the error first appears. Failure to notify
the city in the period and manner set forth in this subsection may result in denial of the customer's claim. If the
city fails to make a determination within 60 days on the validity of the alleged error submitted by the customer
as set forth in this section, the customer's claim will be deemed valid. (Ordinance 10-06-777 adopted 6/8/10)

not be assessed until after 5:00 p.m. of the next business day.
(b) Cutoff notice. Cutoff notices will be mailed to the customer once the ten dollar ($10.00) late fee has been
assessed. To avoid disconnection of service, all payments are due by 5:00 p.m. on the 26th of each month unless
the 26th falls on Saturday, Sunday or a city-approved holiday, and then the last day to pay to avoid disconnection
will be moved to 5:00 p.m. of the next business day.
(c) Reconnect fee during nonbusiness hours. If service requires disconnection for nonpayment of an account
owing up to three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00), the customer shall pay a thirty-five dollar ($35.00) fee, in
addition to the entire bill, to resume service to the account. If service requires disconnection for nonpayment of
an account owing more than three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00), the customer shall pay a reconnect fee in the
amount of 10 percent of the entire bill, in addition to the entire bill, to resume service to the account. Any

bill and/or arrangements with the water-billing clerk have been made for the remaining amount; however, the ten
dollar ($10.00) late fee described in section 13.02.009 will be required due to the bill not being paid by 5:00 p.m.
on the 15th of the month.
(b) Should a customer fail to pay for their water service in accordance with this article and the subject
statement for services, the city will send a certified letter to the customer at the subject address stating the date
the city intends to disconnect water utilities for failure to pay for the services, and who the customer can contact
at the city to schedule a hearing if they wish to dispute the amount of the charges or the decision to disconnect.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 432/652
The customer must request a hearing in writing within five (5) business days of receipt of the letter. If the
customer requests a hearing, the hearing will be scheduled before the intended disconnection date set forth in the
city's letter. The hearing will be held before an officer or employee of the city who has the authority to resolve
the dispute and rescind the disconnection order if the hearing results in a finding that the disconnection order
was issued in error. If the customer fails to request a hearing, or a hearing is held and it is determined that the
order to disconnect is valid, then the city may disconnect the services on the date set forth in the letter. The city
will not terminate water service for nonpayment on Fridays.

droughts and/or more unexpected extenuating circumstances. The first stage is consistent with the mandatory
water conservation efforts. The remaining three stages impose mandatory progressive restrictions on outdoor
water usage. Each stage is normally but not required to be initiated until the prior stage has been activated and
restrictions implemented. This plan applies to all metered water users utilizing the city's public water supply.

(Ordinance 06-05-503 adopted 5/16/06)
C. PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTICE
Upon filing of an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or map, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall call a public hearing on said application.
1. Written notice of such hearing shall be sent to the owner of the property or his agent and to all
owners of real property lying within two hundred (200) feet of the property on which the change in
classification is proposed, such notice to be given not less than ten (10) days before the date of such
hearing, to all owners who have rendered their said property for City taxes as the ownership appears
on the last approved City tax roll. Such notice may be served by depositing the same, properly
addressed and postage paid, in the City Post Office. Where property lying within two hundred (200)
feet of the property proposed to be changed is located in territory which was annexed to the City after
the final date for making the renditions which are included on the last approved City tax roll, notice
to such owners shall be given by one publication in the official newspaper at least fifteen (15) days
before the time of the hearing. Failure of owners to receive notice of hearing shall in no way affect
the validity of the action taken.

feet of the property to be reclassified, each parcel to include the name of the property owner and legal
description.

post an outdoor sign at the location. Such sign shall state when and where a public hearing shall be
held, and such sign shall be posted no later than fifteen (15) days before the date of such hearing. The
City shall provide such sign and may charge a fee therefor.
4. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends

total membership present and voting. A copy of any recommended amendment shall be submitted to
the City Council and shall be accompanied by a report of findings, summary of hearing and any other

Planning and Zoning Commission.
6. The Planning and Zoning Commission may recommend denial of an application with or without
prejudice against the applicant to refile the application. If the Commission recommends denial of the
application and fails to clearly state the same is being denied with prejudice, then it shall be deemed
that said application is being recommended for denial without prejudice against refiling. If it is later
determined by the Commission that there has been a sufficient change in circumstances regarding the
property or in the zoning application itself, it may waive the waiting period and grant a new hearing.

period.

1. If the Planning and Zoning Commission has recommended approval of an application or if the
Planning and Zoning Commission has recommended denial of an application and a notice of appeal
has been filed pursuant to 1-12.C [1-13.C], the City Council shall set said application for public
hearing and shall give notice of the time and place of the hearing by one (1) publication in the official
newspaper at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing, and in addition shall send written notices to
the owner of the property or his agent, and to all property owners of real property lying within two
hundred (200) feet of the subject property pursuant to Section 1-12.C.2 [1-13.C.2].
2. If the Planning and Zoning Commission has recommended to the City Council that a proposed
amendment be disapproved, the City Council may refuse to adopt the amendment by a simple
majority vote of the Councilmen present and voting. However, in order to adopt the amendment
which has been recommended for disapproval by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the
amendment shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all
members of the City Council of the City of Royse City present and voting.
3. When the Planning and Zoning Commission has recommended to the City Council that a
proposed amendment be approved, the City Council may disapprove the petition or application for

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 504/652
4. In the case of a protest against an amendment to the ordinance signed by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) or more, either of the area of the lots or land immediately adjoining the area included
in the proposed change and extending two hundred (200) feet from that area, such amendment shall
not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the City
Council of the City of Royse City.
5. In making its determination, the City Council may consider the following factors:
(a) Whether the uses permitted by the proposed change will be appropriate in the immediate
area concerned and their relationship to the general area and the city as a whole.
(b) Whether the proposed change is in accord with any existing or proposed plans for
providing public schools, streets, water supply, sanitary sewers and other utilities to the area
and shall note the findings.
(c) The amount of vacant land currently classified for similar development in the vicinity and
elsewhere in the city, and any special circumstances which may make a substantial part of such
vacant land unsuitable for development.
(d) The recent rate at which land is being developed in the same zoning classification as the
request, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed changes.
(e) The manner in which other areas designated for similar development will be, or are likely
to be, affected if the proposed amendment is approved, and whether such designation for other
areas should also be modified.
(f) Any other factors which will substantially affect the public health, safety, morals or
general welfare.
6. In considering a motion to deny a zoning application, or upon voting to deny a zoning
application, the City Council shall further consider whether said application shall be denied with or
without prejudice against refiling. If the City Council shall deny the application and fail to clearly
state the same is being denied with prejudice, then it shall be deemed that said application is being
denied without prejudice against refiling. If an application is denied with prejudice, no application
may be filed for all or part of the subject tract of land for a period of one (1) year from the date of
denial by the City Council. If it is determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission that there has
been a sufficient change in circumstances regarding the property or in the zoning application itself, it
may waive the waiting period and grant a new hearing. Newly annexed land which has been given
Agricultural zoning is exempt from the one-year waiting period.
E. LIMITATION OF RESUBMISSION OF PETITION
1. In cases when the application for an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance is denied by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, and no appeal therefrom is taken to the City Council, or in cases
when an application for an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance is denied by the City Council (in
either of said events), said application shall not be eligible for reconsideration for one (1) year
subsequent to such denial. A new application affecting or including all or part of the same property
must be substantially different from the application denied, in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, to be eligible for consideration within one (1) year of the denial of the original
application.
2. In the event of a reapplication affecting the same land for a zone that will permit the same use of
the property as that which would have been permitted under the denied application, the same shall
not be considered to be substantially different from the application denied.

zoning request, at the option of the City Council, may be recalled for a new public hearing.

Amendments to the Zoning Ordinance not involving a particular property but involving change in the zoning
regulations generally do not require notice to individual property owners. In such cases, notice of the required
public hearing shall be given by publication in the official newspaper of the city, stating the time and location of
the public hearing, which time shall not be earlier than fifteen (15) days from the date of such publication.

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 507/652
2. Stay of Proceedings: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from unless the City Manager or a designee shall certify to the Zoning Board of Adjustment that, by

[sic] a court of equity, after notice to the office from whom the appeal was taken.
3. Notice of Hearing on Appeal: The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal
or other matter referred to it, and shall mail notices of such hearing to the petitioner and to the owners

from whom the appeal is taken.
G. VARIANCES
The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the terms of this
ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of this ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this ordinance
shall be observed and substantial justice done, including the following:
1. Permit a variance in the yard requirements of any district where there are unusual and practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the carrying out of the provisions due to an irregular shape of
the lot or topographical or other conditions, provided such variance will not seriously affect any
adjoining property or the general welfare.
2. Authorize, upon appeal, whenever a property owner can show that a strict application of the
terms of this ordinance relating to the construction or alteration of buildings or structures will impose
upon him unusual and practical difficulties or particular hardship, such variances from the strict
application of the terms of this ordinance as are in harmony with its own general purpose and intent,
but only when the Board is satisfied that granting of such variation will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship or difficulty
so great as to warrant a variance from the Comprehensive Plan as established by this ordinance and at
the same time, the surrounding property will be properly protected.
3. The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error of
law in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the City Manager in the
enforcement of this ordinance. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board shall have, in
addition, the following specific powers:
(a) To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises for railroads if such
uses are in general conformance with the Master Plan and present no conflict or nuisance to
adjacent properties.
(b) To permit a public utility or public service or structure in any district, or a public utility or
public service building of a ground area and of a height at variance with those provided for in
the district in which such public utility or public service building is permitted to be located,
when found reasonably necessary for the public health, convenience, safety, or general welfare.

explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%)
of its fair market value, where the Board finds some compelling necessity requiring a
continuance of the nonconforming use.
(e) To waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the districts, when (i)
the character or use of the building is such as to make unnecessary the full provision of parking
or loading facilities; or (ii) when such regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon
the use of the lot. The Board shall not waive or reduce such requirements merely for the
purpose of granting an advantage or a convenience.
(f) A written application for variance shall be submitted together with the required fee,
accompanied by an accurate legal description, maps, site plans, drawings and any necessary
data, demonstrating:
(g) that special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or
building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district;
(h) that literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant
of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this
ordinance;
(i) that the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the
applicant;
(j) that granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege
that is denied by this ordinance to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district; and
(k) no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district
and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered
grounds for the issuance of a variance.

Article 2 - Nonconforming Lots, Structures, and Uses
Section 2-1 Categories of Nonconformity
Within the districts established by this ordinance, or amendments that may later be adopted, there exists:
– lots and uses of land;
– buildings and structures;
– uses of land and buildings in combination; and
characteristics of use which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this
ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue under regulations contained herein until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that such nonconformities
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as ground for adding other buildings and
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
Section 2-2 Nonconforming Uses Regulated
Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts
involved. No nonconforming use of land, building, or nonconforming structure shall be enlarged, changed,
altered, or repaired, except in conformance with the regulations contained in this section.
Section 2-3 Nonconforming Status
Any use, lot, or structure which does not conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located,
is nonconforming when:
1. The use, lot, or structure was in existence and lawfully operating on the date of the passage of
this ordinance, and has since been in regular and continuous use; or
2. The use, lot, or structure is lawful at the time of the adoption of any amendment to this
ordinance, but because of the amendment, no longer complies with applicable regulations; or
3. The use, lot, or structure was in existence at the time of annexation to the city and has since been
in regular and continuous use.
Section 2-4 Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district in which residential, commercial, or industrial buildings are permitted, buildings may be erected
on any single lot of record, or multiple lots of contiguous street frontage in the same ownership, which were
recorded prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
This provision shall apply even though such lot or lots fail to meet the minimum requirements for area, width, or
both, as governed by the applicable area regulations for that particular zoning district; however, all other
provisions of the applicable zoning district area regulations shall apply.
(Ordinance 06-05-503 adopted 5/16/06)
Section 2-5 Nonconforming Uses of Land
Where at the time of passage of this ordinance lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the
regulations imposed by this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
provided:
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 514/652
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater
area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved, in whole or in part, to any portion of the same lot
or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
ordinance.
3. If any such nonconforming use of land is deemed to be abandoned, for any reason, for a period
of more than nine (9) months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
(Ordinance 14-01-1016 adopted 1/28/14)
Section 2-6 Nonconforming Buildings
Where a lawful building exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be
built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location
on the lot, or other requirements concerning the building, such building may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. Structures existing prior to the effective date of this ordinance, which were conforming at that
time, are considered to be legally conforming structure[s] currently.
2. No such nonconforming building may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its
nonconformity, but any building or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity or to
comply with city building codes.
3. Should such nonconforming building or nonconforming portion of a building be destroyed by
any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, or
50 percent of the area of the structure, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance, or when approved by the Board of Adjustment, after public hearing
thereon, when the Board's findings, having due regard for the property rights of persons affected,
were considered in the light of public welfare and the character of the area surrounding the
nonconforming building and the conservation and protection of property.
4. Should such building be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved.
5. All structures located on residentially zoned parcels, at the effective date of this ordinance (June
1, 2006), shall be deemed to be conforming, unless such structure is increased. In such case the
minimum size of structure as contained in the zoning district herein shall apply.
Section 2-7 Nonconforming Uses of Buildings
If lawful use involving individual buildings exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
ordinance, that would not be allowed in a particular district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing building devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is
located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except
in changing the use of the building to a use permitted in the district in which it is located, or to
comply with city building codes.
2. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance,
but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building.
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 515/652
3. If no structural alterations are made, except as required by the city's building codes, any
nonconforming use of a building, or building and premises, may be changed to another
nonconforming use provided that the Board of Adjustment, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more
appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board
of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of
this ordinance.
4. Any building in which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
5. When a nonconforming use of a building is discontinued or abandoned for three consecutive
months, the building shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
6. Where nonconforming use status applied to a building and premises in combination, removal or
destruction of the building shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the
purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the
replacement cost at time of destruction.
(Ordinance 06-05-503 adopted 5/16/06)
7. Any existing building that was a legal conforming use in a Single-Family 1 (SF 1) or Single-
Family (SF 2) zoning at the effective date of this ordinance (June 1, 2006) and was in use as a singlefamily
residence, shall be deemed to be conforming. It shall remain so until such time as any of the
provisions in section (2-9, nonconforming uses discontinued) shall apply. Until that time, all other
sections of this ordinance shall apply with the exception of Section 2-6, Nonconforming Uses of
Buildings, paragraph 6. (Ordinance 06-12-543, sec. 2, adopted 12/12/06)
Section 2-8 Repairs and Maintenance
1. On any nonconforming building or portion of a building containing a nonconforming use, work may be
done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing
walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding 50 percent of the current replacement cost of the
nonconforming building or nonconforming portion of the building, as the case may be; provided that the cubic
content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
2. If a nonconforming building or portion of a building containing a nonconforming use becomes physically
unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized city official to
be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt,
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
3. Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of
any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon
order of such official.
Section 2-9 Nonconforming Uses Discontinued
A nonconforming use of any building or structure, which has been discontinued, shall not thereafter be returned
to any nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued when:
1. It has been replaced with a conforming use;
2. Such building or structure is or hereafter becomes vacant and remains unoccupied or out of use
for a continuous period of three months, or the equipment and furnishings of the nonconforming use

https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 516/652
have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced within such three-month period; or
3. The intention of the owner to permanently discontinue the use is apparent.

Article 5 - Special Districts
Section 5-1 PD - Planned Development District
A. GENERAL PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION
The Planned Development District “PD” prefix is intended to provide for combining and mixing of uses allowed
in various districts with appropriate regulations and to permit flexibility in the use and design of land and
buildings in situations where modification of specific provisions of this ordinance is not contrary to its intent and
purpose or significantly inconsistent with the planning on which it is based and will not be harmful to the
community. A PD District may be used to permit new and innovative concepts in land utilization. While great
flexibility is given to provide special restrictions which will allow development not otherwise permitted,
procedures are established herein to insure against misuse of the increased flexibility.
B. PERMITTED USES
Any use specified in the ordinance granting a Planned Development District shall be permitted in that district.
The size, location, appearance, and method of operation may be specified to the extent necessary to insure
compliance with the purpose of this ordinance.
C. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
1. Development standards for each separate PD District shall be set forth in the ordinance granting
the PD District and may include but shall not be limited to uses, density, lot area, lot width, lot depth,
yard depths and widths, building height, building elevations, coverage, floor area ratio, parking,
access, screening, landscaping, accessory buildings, signs, lighting, management associations, and
other requirements as the City Council may deem appropriate.

PD granted therein. A specific list is required of variances in each district or districts and a general
statement citing the reason for the PD request.
3. The Planned Development District shall conform to all other sections of the ordinance unless
specifically exempted in the granting ordinance.
D. CONCEPTUAL AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN
In establishing a Planned Development District, the City Council shall approve and file as part of the amending
ordinance appropriate plans and standard[s] for each Planned Development District. During the review and
public hearing process, the City Council shall require a conceptual plan and a development plan (or detail site
plan).
1. Conceptual Plan - This plan shall be submitted by the applicant. The plan shall show the
applicant's intent for the use of the land within the proposed Planned Development District in a
graphic manner and shall be supported by written documentation of proposals and standards for
development.
(a) A conceptual plan for residential land use shall show general use, thoroughfares, and
preliminary lot arrangements. For residential development which does not propose platted lots,
the conceptual plan shall set forth the size, type, and location of buildings and building sites,
access, density, building height, fire lanes, screening, parking areas, landscaped areas, and other
pertinent development data.
(b) A conceptual plan for uses other than residential uses shall set forth the land use proposals
in a manner to adequately illustrate the type and nature of the proposed development. Data
which may be submitted by the applicant, or required by the City Council, may include but is
not limited to the types of use(s), topography, and boundary of the PD area, physical features of
the site, existing streets, alleys, and easements, location of future public facilities, building
heights and locations, parking ratios, and other information to adequately describe the proposed
development and to provide data for approval which is to be used in drafting the final
development plan.
(c) Changes of detail which do not alter the basic relationship of the proposed development
to adjacent property and which do not alter the uses permitted or increase the density, building
height, or coverage of the site and which do not decrease the off-street parking ratio, reduce the
yards provided at the boundary of the site, or alter the landscape plans as indicated on the
approved conceptual plan may be authorized by the City Manager or his/her designee. If an
agreement cannot be reached regarding whether or not a detail site plan conforms to the original
concept plan, the City Council shall determine the conformity.
[2. Reserved.]
3 Development Plan or Detailed Site Plan - This plan shall set forth the final plans for development
of the Planned Development District and shall conform to the data presented and approved on the
conceptual plan. Approval of the development plan shall be the basis for issuance of a building
permit. The development plan may be submitted for the total area of the PD or for any section to the
City Council. A public hearing on approval of the development plan shall be required at the Council
level, unless such a hearing is waived pursuant to Section 5-1, D, Conceptual and Development Plan,
at the time of conceptual plan approval in the original amending ordinance. The development plan
shall include:
(a) A site inventory analysis including a scale drawing, existing vegetation, natural
watercourses, creeks or bodies of water, and an analysis of planned changes in such natural
7/15/2019 https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0
https://z2codes.franklinlegal.net/franklin/PrintViewer.jsp?printCollection=0 577/652
features as a result of the development. This should include a delineation of any floodprone
areas.
(b) A scale drawing showing any proposed public or private streets and alleys; building sites
or lots; and areas reserved as parks, parkways, playgrounds, utility easements, school sites,
street widening and street changes; the points of ingress and egress from existing streets;
general location and description of existing and proposed utility services, including size of
water and sewer mains; the location and width for all curb cuts and the land area of all abutting
sites and the zoning classification thereof on an accurate survey of the tract with the
topographical contour interval of two or not more than five (5) feet at location of entry slope as
determined by the City.
(c) A site plan for proposed building complexes showing the location of separate buildings,
and between buildings and property lines, street lines, and alley lines. Also to be included on
the site plan is a plan showing the arrangement and provision for off-street parking.
(d) A landscape plan showing screening walls, ornamental planting, wooded areas, and trees
to be planted.
(e) An architectural plan showing elevations and signage style to be used throughout the
development in all districts except single-family and two-family may be required by the City
Council if deemed appropriate. Any or all of the required information may be incorporated on a
single drawing if such drawing is clear and can be evaluated by the City Manager or his/her
designee.
4 Procedure for Establishment - The procedure for establishing a Planned Development District
shall follow the procedure for zoning amendments as set forth in Section 1-12 [1-13] Amendments,
Changes, and Administrative Procedures. This procedure is expanded as follows for approval of
conceptual and development plans.
(a) Separate public hearings shall be held by City Council for the approval of the conceptual
plan and the development plan or any section of the development plan, unless such
requirements are waived by the City Council upon a determination that a single public hearing
is adequate. A single public hearing is adequate when:
(b) The applicant submits adequate data with the request for the Planned Development
District to fulfill the requirements for both plans; or
(c) Information on the concept plan is sufficient to determine the appropriate use of the land
and the detail site plan will not deviate substantially from it; and
(d) The requirement is waived at the time the amending ordinance is approved. If the
requirement is waived, the conditions shall be specifically stated in the amending ordinance.
(e) The ordinance establishing the Planned Development District shall not be approved until
the conceptual plan is approved.
(f) The development plan may be approved in sections. When the plan is approved in
sections, the separate approvals by the City Council for the initial and subsequent sections will
be required.
(g) Regardless of whether the public hearing is waived for the development plan, approval by
the City Council is still required.
E. WRITTEN REPORT MAY BE REQUIRED

construction shall be construed to mean that form of construction composed of brick, stone, or
decorative split face block, or combination of these materials laid up unit by unit and set in mortar
with a natural finish and shall exclude wall area devoted to doors and windows (does not include
exterior insulated finish
systems (EIFS)). As applicable to meeting the minimum requirements for the exterior

Certain land uses, because of their nature and location, are not appropriate for categorizing into installations,
such as colleges and universities, institutions, community facilities, zoos, cemeteries, country clubs, show
grounds, drive-in theaters and other unusual land uses not specifically provided for in this chapter. To provide

permit for a specific use in a specific location. This procedure for approval of a specific use permit includes a
public hearing. The amending ordinance may provide for certain restrictions and standards for operation. The
indication that it is possible to grant a specific use permit as noted elsewhere in this ordinance does not
constitute a grant of privilege for such use, nor is there any obligation to approve a specific use permit unless it
is the finding of the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council that such a special use is compatible
with adjacent property use and consistent with the character of the neighborhood.

reduction shall not represent more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total required spaces and shall
require a special exception.
