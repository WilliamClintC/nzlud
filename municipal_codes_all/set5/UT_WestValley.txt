2-5-101. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS.
There is an underlying policy in the City strongly favoring the careful consideration of matters involving constitutional taking claims, in fairness to the owner of private property bringing the claim and in view of the uncertainty and expense involved in defending lawsuits alleging such issues. At the same time, the legitimate role of government in lawfully regulating real property must be preserved, and the public's right to require the dedication or exaction of property must be consistent with the Constitution. Consistent with this policy, it is desired that a procedure be established for the review of actions that may involve the issue of a constitutional taking. These provisions are to assist governments in considering decisions that may involve constitutional takings. It is intended that a procedure for such a review be provided, as well as guidelines for such considerations. This ordinance is further intended and shall be construed to objectively and fairly review claims by citizens that a specific government action should require payment of just compensation, yet preserve the ability of the City to lawfully regulate real property and fulfill its other duties and functions.
(Ord. No. 94-124 Enacted 12/06/1994)

(1) Criteria for Designating Properties to the West Valley City Historic Sites List. Any district, building, structure, object or site may be designated to the Historic Sites List if it meets all the criteria outlined below:
    a. It is located within the official boundaries of the city.
    b. It is at least 50 years old.
    c. It retains its historic integrity, in that there are no major alterations or additions that have obscured or destroyed the significant historic features.

    d. If the property does not meet the integrity requirements outlined in 3.a., it may still qualify for designation if it meets one of the following requirements for exceptional significance:
        i. It is directly associated with events of historic significance in the community.
        ii. It is closely associated with the lives of persons who were of historic importance to the community.

    a. Completed Intensive Level Survey documentation for each nominated property must be submitted to the Historic Preservation Commission.
    b. The commission will review and consider properly submitted nominations at its next scheduled meeting. The commission will notify the nominating party, either orally or in writing, one week prior to the meeting that the nomination will be considered and will place that item on the agenda posted for the meeting. The one-week notification may be waived at the nominating party's option in order to accommodate "last-minute" submittals.
    c. The Historic Preservation Commission will review the documentation for completeness, accuracy and compliance with the "Criteria for Designating Historic Properties to the West Valley City Historic Sites List" and will make its decision accordingly.
(3) Results of Designation to the Historic Sites List. 
    a. Owners of officially designated historic sites may obtain a historic site certificate from the Historic Preservation Commission. The certificate contains the historic name of the property, the date of designation, and signatures of the mayor and the Historic Preservation Commission chairperson.
    b. If a historic site is to be demolished or extensively altered, efforts will be made to document its physical appearance before that action takes place.
        i. The City will delay issuing a demolition permit for a maximum of thirty (30) days and will notify a member of the Historic Preservation Commission, which will take responsibility for the documentation.
        ii. Documentation will include, at minimum, exterior photographs (both black-and-white and color slides) of all elevations of the historic building. When possible, both exterior and interior measurements of the building will be made in order to provide an accurate floor-plan drawing of the building.
        iii. The demolition permit will be issued after thirty (30) days of the initial application whether or not the Commission has documented the building. The permit may be issued earlier if the Commission completes its documentation before the thirty-day deadline.
(4) Removal of Properties from the Historic Sites List. Properties which, in the opinion of the Historic Preservation Commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility may be removed from the Historic Sites List after review and consideration by the commission and recommendation to the City Council.
(Ord. No. 08-44 Enacted 09/17/2008)

3-17-104. WEST VALLEY CITY HISTORIC LANDMARK REGISTER.
Significant historic properties may be designated to the Historic Landmark Register for the purposes of recognizing their significance and providing incentives and guidelines for their preservation.
(1) Criteria for Designating Properties to the West Valley City Historic Landmark Register. Any district, building, structure, object or site may be designated to the Historic Landmark Register if it meets the criteria outlined below:
    a. It is located within the official boundaries of the City.
    b. It is currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places and a copy of the approved National Register form has been placed in the local historic preservation files.
    c. A property not yet listed in the National Register must:
        i. Retain its historic integrity as defined in Section 4.A.3.a., and
        ii. Meet at least one of the following National Register criteria:

        iv. associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
        v. embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
        vi. have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history (archeological sites, for example).
    d. It has been documented according to the Utah State Historic Preservation Office standards for Intensive Level Surveys (June 1993 version or subsequent revisions) or National Register standards and a copy of that documentation has been placed in the local historic preservation files.
    e. Owner Approval
        i. Individual properties. The owner of the property must approve the action to designate his/her property to the Historic Landmark Register by submitting to the Commission a written statement to that effect.
        ii. Historic districts. A majority (over 50 percent) of the property owners in a proposed historic district must be in favor of the designation or at least not opposed to it. Written objections from over 50 percent of the property owners will constitute lack of approval and will halt the designation process.
(2) Designation Procedures. 
    a. Submittal to the Commission of complete Intensive Level Survey or National Register of Historic Places documentation shall initiate the review process.
    b. The Commission shall place properly submitted nominations on the agenda for its next scheduled meeting and shall notify the nominating party and the property owner, either orally or in writing, fourteen (14) days prior to the meeting that the nomination will be considered. The fourteen-day notification period may be waived at the property owner’s option. In the case of historic districts, notification of proposed nominations may be made by public notice placed in the local newspaper or posted in a public building.
    c. The Commission shall review the documentation for completeness, accuracy, and compliance with the "Criteria for Designating Properties to the West Valley City Historic Landmark Register" and may, by passage of an appropriate resolution, recommend that the City Council designate properties to the Historic Landmark Register.
(3) Notification and Recording of Designation. Following designation, a notice of such shall be mailed to the owners of record together with a copy of this ordinance. In the case of historic district designation, notice of such may be placed in the local newspaper or in a public building rather than mailed to each owner of property in the district. The Commission shall record the Historic Landmark Register status designation with the County Recorder's Office.
(4) Results of Designation to the Historic Landmark Register. 
    a. Properties designated to the Historic Landmark Register may receive special consideration in the granting of zoning variances or conditional use permits in order to encourage their preservation.
    b. In the event of rehabilitation of the property, local building officials will consider waiving certain code requirements in accordance with Chapter 34 of the Uniform Building Code (1994 Edition), which deals with historic buildings, and the Uniform Code for Building Conservation, a special code for existing buildings.
    c. Owners of Historic Landmarks may seek assistance from the Historic Preservation Commission in applying for grants or tax credits for rehabilitating their properties.
    d. Proposed exterior work on Historic Landmarks is subject to the review and approval of the Historic Preservation Commission. The purpose of this review is to ensure the preservation of historic properties to the greatest degree possible. This review applies to individually designated Landmark properties or any property, contributing or non-contributing, located in a Landmark-designated historic district. This review applies only to exterior work which requires a building permit, sign permit, or demolition permit.
        i. Applications for building, demolition, or sign permits pertaining to, shall be forwarded by the Building Inspection Department to the Historic Preservation Commission prior to their issuance.
        ii. A permit applicant, in order to obtain a permit from the Building Inspections Division, shall file a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness with the Commission on a form furnished by the Commission.
        iii. At its next scheduled meeting, the Commission shall review the application and proposed work for compliance with the "Standards for Rehabilitation," hereafter referred to as the "Standards," and any design guidelines adopted by the Commission and City Council.
            1. Applicants whose proposed projects comply with the provisions of this Title shall be issued a "Certificate of Historic Appropriateness" within ten (10) days, which authorizes the issuance of the appropriate permit.
            2. Applicants whose proposed projects are found to be in non-compliance with this Title shall be offered a negotiating period of sixty (60) days, during which time the Commission and applicant shall explore all options for an acceptable solution. These may include the feasibility of modifying the plans, using the historic landmark for alternative purposes, and reselling the property to another party. The Commission may extend the negotiating period an additional sixty (60) days for the purposes described above if deemed necessary to accommodate a potential solution.
            3. If no solution has been agreed upon at the conclusion of either the initial sixty-day (60) period or the full one hundred twenty-day (120) period the Certificate of Historic Appropriateness will be denied; consequently, the Building Official shall not issue any permits.
        iv. Claims of Economic Hardship. The Commission may approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for Rehabilitation or Demolition of a landmark property if the owner has presented substantial evidence demonstrating that unreasonable economic hardship will result from denial of the certificate of appropriateness.
            1. Economic Hardship Criteria. In order to sustain a claim of unreasonable economic hardship, the Commission may require the owner to provide information to whether the property is capable of producing a reasonable return for the owner.
            2. Demonstration of economic hardship by the owner shall not be based on conditions resulting from willful or negligent acts by the owner, purchasing the property for substantially more than market value at the time of purchase, failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs, failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants, or failure to provide normal tenant improvements.
    v. An applicant who has been denied any permit by the Building Official, based on the Commission’s refusal to issue a Certificate of Historic Appropriateness, may appeal that decision to the City Council. The appeal must be made on or before thirty (30) days after the Commission’s decision.
(5) Removal of Properties from the Historic Landmark Register. Properties which, in the opinion of the Historic Preservation Commission, no longer meet the criteria for eligibility may be removed from the Historic Landmark Register after review and consideration by the Commission.
(6) Enforcement. The provisions of this section are subject to the enforcement provisions established in the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Code for Building Conservation, or in the Uniform Housing Code as adopted by West Valley City.
(Ord. No. 08-44 Enacted 09/17/2008)

3-17-105. STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION AND DESIGN GUIDELINES.
The following standards and guidelines shall be used by the Historic Preservation Commission in determining the historic appropriateness of any application pertaining to Historic Landmark properties. This includes individually designated Landmark properties and both contributing and noncontributing properties in Landmark-designated historic districts. In approving an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Commission shall find that the project substantially complies with all of the following standards and guidelines that pertain to the application and that the decision is in the best interest of the City.
(1) Standards for Rehabilitation. These standards are based on the “Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation,” which serve as a national and state model for appropriate preservation treatment. The standards are as follows:
    a. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
    b. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
    c. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
    d. Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
    e. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
    f. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
    g. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
    h. Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
    i. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
    j. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(2) General Design Guidelines. 
    a. Landmark Buildings and Contributing Buildings in Landmark-designated Historic Districts. 
        i. Avoid demolition of landmark and contributing buildings. They are a finite resource and cannot be replaced.
        ii. Vacant buildings should be weather- and vandal-proofed in order to minimize further deterioration and the threat to public safety.
        iii. Rehabilitation work, especially on the exterior and the principal facade, should preserve existing historic features or replace them if absolutely necessary with features and materials known to have existed on the building. Avoid “dressing up” buildings by adding features based on speculation.
        iv. Avoid moving buildings whenever possible, especially to create artificial groupings of historic buildings. If buildings must be moved, the new site should be similar to the original site, and the original setback and orientation of the building on the lot should be replicated.
    b. Additions to Landmark and Contributing Buildings and Construction of New Buildings within an Historic District. 
        i. New additions to landmark and contributing buildings should be subordinate to the original building, that is, lower in height, attached to the rear or set back along the side, and subordinate in scale and architectural detailing.
        ii. Height, width, setback, roof shape, and the overall scale and massing of new buildings should be compatible with surrounding historic buildings and the overall streetscape.
        iii. Materials on at least the primary facade(s) should be similar to original materials on facades of surrounding historic buildings (usually brick, stucco, stone, or wood siding, depending on the specific characteristics of the district.
        iv. Architectural details (including wood or metal trim, porches, cornices, arches, window and door features, etc.) should not replicate historic features on surrounding historic buildings.
        v. Window and door openings should be similar in size and orientation (vertical or horizontal) to openings on historic buildings and should take up about the same percentage of the overall facade as those on surrounding historic buildings.
        vi. Proportion of Principal Facades. The relationship of the width to the height of the principal elevations shall be in scale with surrounding structures and streetscape. Wider new buildings can be divided into segments that more closely resemble the facade widths of historic buildings.
        vii. Roof Shape. The roof shape of a building shall be visually compatible with the surrounding structures and streetscape. Unusual roof shapes, pitches, and colors are discouraged.

5-2-103. BID EVALUATION.
(1) Generally. Bids, proposals, and related matters shall be evaluated using the criteria in this Chapter.
(2) City’s Evaluation Process. When evaluating matters, the City shall consider the following:
    a. Solicitation Criteria. The City shall consider the evaluation criteria stated in a bid or proposal package or other solicitation document.
    b. Chapter Criteria. As further described in this Chapter, the City shall consider whether a bid, proposal or other offer or submission is responsive to the City’s request, whether the bidder or offeror is responsible, and whether any element conflicts with the other criteria of this Chapter.
        i. Due Diligence. The City may take steps as it deems appropriate to verify and determine any matter. The City shall determine in its sole discretion what steps may be appropriate in light of the matters being considered and the resources of the City. The failure to discover any matter shall not preclude any subsequent evaluation or action.
        ii. Records. In the manner it shall determine, the Purchasing Agent shall retain in procurement file records relevant to a solicitation or award.
        iii. Evaluating Responsiveness. To be responsive, a bid, proposal or other offer or submission must conform in all material respects to the terms of the City’s solicitation documents. Such terms may include, but are not limited to, using bid forms, mandatory submittals, required securities, and appropriate substantive responses. Ministerial errors and other matters in a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will not necessarily render it non-responsive, and the Purchasing Agent shall review such matters and determine whether the submission is responsive. The Purchasing Agent may evaluate responsiveness based on any additional reasonable criteria.
        iv. Evaluating Responsibility. To be responsible, a bidder or offeror must have the capability in all respects to fully perform the Agreement requirements, and the integrity, capacity and reliability which will assure good faith performance.
        v. Factors. The City may consider any relevant factors when evaluating responsibility, including the following:
            1. The bidder’s capacity to perform the contractual requirements, including whether the bidder has available appropriate financial, material, equipment, facility and personnel resources and expertise, or the ability to obtain them. Without limitation, capacity may also include legal capacity to enter Agreements, the ability to perform within required times, or the ability to perform any necessary future service and maintenance.
            2. The bidder’s ability, skill and quality of performance.
            3. The bidder’s character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency.
            4. The bidder’s ability to work cooperatively with the City, including, without limitation, whether the bidder has previously failed to comply with City Agreements or other requirements, nonpayment of sums due to the City, poor working relationships with or adversarial actions against the City, suspension, or other proceedings by the City against the bidder, or failure to assist the City in determining responsibility.
        vi. Making a Determination. The submission of any bid, proposal or other offer or submission constitutes an agreement by the bidder or offeror to reasonably assist the City with its determination of responsibility.
        vii. Effect of Determination. The City’s determination of responsibility relates solely to a bidder’s overall ability to perform for a specific procurement, and is not a general assessment of a bidder’s capabilities.
        viii. Evaluating Specific Matters. For any bid, proposal, other offer, or submission:
            1. Tie Bids. Tie bids occur when identical prices are submitted from responsive and responsible bidders and that price is the low bid. The Purchasing Agent shall make an award in a manner that is beneficial to the City, and may make an award in manner that will discourage tie bids. Such may include:
                a. Award to the Person closest to the point of delivery.
                b. Award to the Person who previously held the Agreement.
                c. Award to the Person with the earliest delivery date.
            2. Only One Received. If the City receives only one responsive bid, proposal or other offer or submission, the City may make an award to that bidder or offeror if the Purchasing Agent determines the bid, proposal or other offer or submission is fair and reasonable and conforms to all applicable requirements, and that other prospective bidders or offerors had reasonable opportunity to respond or that there is not adequate time for a resolicitation. The written determination and basis for decision shall be placed in the procurement file. The City may also reject the sole bid, proposal or other offer or submission.
        ix. Inspections and Tests. The City may perform inspections, tests and other evaluations in any manner conducive to the City’s interest, including, without limitation, the use of third parties. All prospective and actual recipients of a bid or agreement shall provide all reasonable assistance and information required by the City to perform an inspection, test or other evaluation.
        x. Modifying Submissions. After the time for submission, a bid, proposal or other offer or submission may be modified as follows:
            1. Confirmation of Bid, Proposal or Other Matter. When it appears a mistake has been made, or when the City desires an assurance of any matter, the City may request a bidder or offeror to confirm the bid, proposal or other offer or submission in writing.
            2. Notification of Error. A bidder or offeror shall notify the Purchasing Agent of any error contained in a bid, proposal or other offer or submission within two business days after bid opening or the time for submitting proposals unless the Purchasing Agent waives this requirement. The Purchasing Agent shall have sole discretion to determine whether to permit any modification or withdrawal.
            3. Modifications by Agreement. The Purchasing Agent may agree with a bidder or offeror to any modifications so long as they do not prejudice fair competition or the City’s interests. Modifications may include such matters as:
                a. Time for Accepting. The Purchasing Agent and bidder or offeror may agree that a bid, proposal or other offer or submission will remain effective for a longer period of time than that stated in the bid, proposal or other offer or submission.
                b. Subcontractor or Supplier Changes. Any proposed change in subcontractors or suppliers must be submitted to the Purchasing Agent, and the Purchasing Agent may reject any such proposed change. The bidder or offeror will receive no additional compensation as a result of a change to any subcontractors or suppliers, and must continue to meet the requirements of any federally-mandated program and other contractual and legal requirements.
                c. Change in Specifications. The Purchasing Agent and bidder or offeror may agree to a change in specifications when such change is in the City’s interest, is reasonably related to the work originally solicited, and would not be prejudicial to fair competition.
                d. City’s Correction of Ministerial Mistakes. The Purchasing Agent may at any time correct mistakes in a bid or proposal that are of a ministerial or minor nature as follows:
                    i. Ministerial Mistakes. Ministerial or minor informalities are clerical errors and matters of form rather than substance that are evident from the document, or insignificant mistakes or informalities that can be waived or corrected without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. They generally do not have a substantial effect on price. Examples include a failure to:
                        1Sign the bid, proposal, or other submissions requiring signature, but only where they are accompanied by other materials indicating an intent to be bound.
                        2Acknowledge receipt of an addendum, but only if the materials demonstrate the bidder or offeror received the addendum and intended to be bound by it, or the addendum has a negligible effect on the bid, proposal or other offer or submission.
                        3 Mistakes Where Intent is EvidentIf the intent of the bid, proposal or other offer or submission is clearly evident on the face of the document, the Purchasing Agent shall correct it as intended and it may not be withdrawn. Examples include:
                            aTypographical errors.
                            bErrors in extending unit prices.
                            cTransposition errors.
                            dArithmetical errors.
                            eDifferences in written and numerical prices (written shall control).
                    4. Mistakes Where Intent Not Evident. If the bidder or offeror’s intent is not clearly evident on the face of the document, the bid, proposal or other offer or submission may not be withdrawn except as agreed by the Purchasing Agent.
                    5. Correcting Errors in Judgment. Errors in judgment may not be corrected, and the bid, proposal or other offer or submission may not be withdrawn, except as agreed by the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent may allow correction of an error in judgment if it can be done without prejudice to other bidders or offerors. The Purchasing Agent may allow withdrawal if it is in the City’s interest.

(Ord. No. 03-07 Enacted 01/21/2003)

5-2-107. PRE-QUALIFICATION.
Where deemed appropriate by the City, bidders, proponents and/or suppliers may be pre-qualified for particular types of supplies, services and construction to determine the responsibility of such bidder, proponent or suppliers.
(1) Invitation To Pre-Qualify. Each pre-qualification proceeding shall be commenced by the Purchasing Agent or designee issuing an invitation to pre-qualify, which shall include the factors stated in subsection (3) and any other factors related to the particular types of supplies, services and construction deemed necessary by the City to determine responsibility. All factors shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the purposes intended and to encourage competition in satisfying the City’s needs, and shall not be unduly restrictive.
(2) Public Notice. All noticing shall be processed through the City Recorder or designee.

If such information is not supplied, City shall base the determination of responsibility upon any available information or may find the bidder, proponent or supplier non-responsible if such failure, as determined by City, is unreasonable.
(5) Invitation to Bid.

5-3-101. COMPETITIVE SEALED BIDDING.
(1) Conditions for Use. All City Purchases shall be awarded and obtained by competitive sealed bidding except as otherwise provided in this Title.
(2) Invitation for Bids. Each competitive sealed bid proceeding shall be commenced by the Purchasing Agent or designee issuing an invitation for bids, which shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement and in compliance with this Title. All specifications shall be drafted so as to promote overall economy for the purposes intended and to encourage competition in satisfying the City’s needs, and shall not be unduly restrictive. The policy enunciated in this Section applies to all specifications including, but not limited to, those prepared for the City by architects, engineers, designers, and draftsmen.
(3) Public Notice. All noticing shall be processed through the City Recorder or designee. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given for a reasonable time, and not less than five (5) working days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. Such notice may include publication in a newspaper of general circulation a reasonable time prior to bid opening. The public notice shall state the place, date, and time of bid opening.
(4) Bid Opening. All bids shall be accepted and opened by the City Recorder or designee. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, the name of each bidder, and such other relevant information as the Purchasing Agent deems appropriate, shall be recorded; the record and each bid shall be open to public inspection.
(5) Bid Acceptance and Bid Evaluation. Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this Ordinance. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include, but are not limited to, criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids.
(6) Correction or Withdrawal of Bids; Cancellation of Awards. Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or Agreements based on such bid mistakes may be permitted by the Purchasing Agent where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written, telegraphic or facsimile notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. After the bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the City or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:
    a. the mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
    b. the bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or Agreements based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a written determination made by the Purchasing Agent.
(7) Award. The Purchase shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids, unless otherwise provided for in this ordinance.
(8) Multi-Step Sealed Bidding. When it is considered impractical to prepare an initial purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation.
(9) Cancellation of Invitation for Bids. An invitation for bids, or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is in the best interests of the City. Each solicitation issued by the City shall state that the solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in whole or in part when in the best interests of the City. Notice of cancellation shall be sent to all businesses responding. The notice shall identify the solicitation, explain the reason for cancellation and, where appropriate, explain that an opportunity will be given to compete on any resolicitation or any future procurement of similar items. Reasons for rejection shall be provided upon request by unsuccessful bidders or offerors.

(2) Request for Proposals. Competitive sealed proposals shall be solicited through a Request For Proposals (“RFP”).
(3) Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the RFP shall be given in the same manner as provided in Section 5-3-101(3).
(4) Receipt of Proposals. No proposal’s contents, except for the names of the offerors, shall be disclosed to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of proposals shall be prepared containing the name of each offeror, the number of modifications received, if any, and a description sufficient to identify the item offered. The register of proposals shall be open for public inspection only after award.
(5) Evaluation Factors. The RFP shall state the relative importance of price and other evaluation factors, including the quantitative basis for evaluation. No criteria may be used in an RFP response evaluation that are not set forth in the RFP.
(6) Discussion with Responsible Offerors and Revisions to Proposals. As provided in the RFP, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to have a reasonable chance of being selected in order to clarify and assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment to discuss and revise proposals in writing and such written revisions may be permitted by the selection committee after submissions and prior to award to obtain best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors, except for the names of the offerors.
(7) Award. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the City, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the RFP. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The file shall contain the basis on which the award is made.
(8) Cancellation of an RFP. An RFP, or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is for good cause and in the best interests of the City. Each solicitation issued by the City shall state that the solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in whole or in part for good cause when in the best interests of the City.

7-9-101. PURPOSE.
The purpose of these off-Street parking requirements is to reduce congestion and traffic hazards in the City by incorporating adequate, attractively-designed off-Street parking and loading facilities for various Uses. Parking areas shall be designed in such a manner that they will result in maximum efficiency, protection of public safety, provide for the special needs of those with disabilities, and where appropriate, insulate surrounding Uses from adverse impacts created by such parking.

7-9-102. GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
At the time any Building, Structure or Use is changed such that there is an increase in the capacity or Intensity of the Use, off-Street parking shall be required in compliance with this Chapter. All off-Street parking and loading facilities within the City shall comply with all of the standards prescribed in this Chapter, and shall be permanently maintained in good condition for the duration of the Use or Uses served by the facility. All paved areas shall be maintained in good repair without broken parts, potholes or litter. Parking Lot striping and all other parking identification shall be installed in a professional manner and maintained so as to be clearly visible.

7-9-103. SITE PLAN AND LIGHTING PLAN REQUIRED.
All applications for a Permitted or Conditional Use shall be accompanied by a detailed Site Plan and lighting plan as required by this Title showing the required off-Street Parking Spaces. Parking Lots with less than five spaces are not required to submit a lighting plan.

7-9-104. COMPUTATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES.
The tables below contain the minimum parking requirements for specific Uses. The maximum percentage allowed for compact spaces is also given. Special requirements for each Use are provided under the “Notes” column where appropriate. If in the application of the requirements of this Title a fractional number is obtained, any fraction will be disregarded.
The number of Parking Spaces required by these schedules may be reduced or increased as a condition of the Planning Commission’s review for Conditional Use applications or as approved by the Zoning Administrator or designee for Permitted Uses if it can be demonstrated through a parking study that the proposed Use(s) would have a parking demand less than or in excess of the requirements stated in this Chapter. This parking study must be validated through empirical evidence, which is acceptable to the Zoning Administrator or designee, from similar Uses. Parking studies which include the use of alternative modes of transportation to reduce the number of Parking Spaces required must be prepared by an engineer.

7-9-105. SHARED PARKING.
(1) When any land or Building is under the same Ownership or under a joint use agreement and is used for two or more purposes, the number of Parking Spaces is computed by multiplying the minimum amount of parking normally required for each Use by the appropriate percentage as shown in the following parking credit schedule for each of the five time periods shown. The number of Parking Spaces required is determined by totaling the resulting numbers in each column; the column total that generates the highest number of Parking Spaces then becomes the parking requirement.

    b. Insure adequate open space for traffic, recreation, light and air.
    c. Facilitate the conservation of, or production of, adequate transportation, water, sanitation, drainage and energy resources.
    d. Avoid scattered and premature Subdivisions which would cause insufficient public services and facilities, or necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services and facilities.
    e. Preserve outstanding natural, cultural or historic features.
(2) This Chapter is designed to inform the Subdivider and public of the requirements and conditions necessary to obtain approval of a Subdivision. To this end, all requirements, where possible, are expressly delineated in this Title or other applicable ordinances.

(2) Trees, native land cover, natural watercourses, and topography shall be preserved when possible. Subdivisions shall be so designed as to prevent excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. The design of new Subdivisions shall consider, and relate to, existing Street widths, alignments and names.
(3) Community facilities, such as parks and recreation areas, and transportation facilities shall be provided in the Subdivision in accordance with the General Plan, this Title, and other applicable ordinances. This Title establishes procedures for the referral of information on proposed Subdivisions to interested boards, bureaus, and other governmental agencies and utility companies, both private and public, so that the extension of community facilities and utilities may be accomplished in an orderly manner, coordinated with the Development of the Subdivision. To facilitate the acquisition of land areas required to implement this policy, the Subdivider may be required to dedicate, grant easements over or otherwise reserve land for parks, Public Ways, utility easements, and other public purposes as specified.

    a. That proposed Lots conform to the previously approved General Plan;
    b. That the utility and/or vehicular access to remaining undeveloped property will not be impaired; and
    c. That remnant parcels are not created which, due to size, configuration or location, are not developable.

7-13-602. APPROVAL REQUIRED.
(1) Prior to the Subdivision of any parcel or tract by metes and bounds, such Subdivision shall be approved by the Community and Economic Development Director. The approval shall be based on the compliance of the proposed Subdivision with the laws and ordinances of the City with respect to Street improvements, installation of utilities, Zoning requirements and Flood control requirements.
(2) The Subdivider shall submit a complete application which shall include digital copies of the property survey and legal description certified by a Professional Land Surveyor, and any necessary improvement plans and bond agreements. At the time application is made, the Owner shall pay an application fee as published in the Consolidated Fee Schedule.
(3) The Community and Economic Development Department shall review the proposed Subdivision and shall request recommendations from the Public Works Department, Water and Sewer Improvement District and other appropriate agencies.
(4) The Subdivision may be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. The decision shall be made within a reasonable time period after receipt of the application.
(5) If the survey is in compliance with all ordinances and conditions, the plat shall be signed by the Community and Economic Development Director or his or her designee.
(6) The Subdivider shall file the record of survey in the office of the Salt Lake County Surveyor.

7-13-700P PART 7 – GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF ALL SUBDIVISIONS

7-13-701. SUBDIVISION LAYOUT.
(1) The Subdivision layout shall conform to the standards of this Title.
(2) Where trees, groves, waterways, scenic points, historic spots or other City assets and landmarks, as determined by the City, are located within a proposed Subdivision, every possible means shall be provided to preserve these features.
(3) Whenever a tract to be subdivided adjoins or embraces any part of an existing or proposed Street so designated on the Major Street Plan, such part of the Public Way shall be platted and dedicated, and improved by the Subdivider in the location and at the width specified. Cul-de-sacs are discouraged in order to provide better connectivity between neighborhoods. All road designs shall be approved by the City Public Works Department.
(4) Where a railroad Right-of-way abuts a Subdivision, the plat shall make provisions for future Grade separations whenever the City shall find such a requirement to be necessary.

7-13-702. COMMENCEMENT OF SITE DEVELOPMENT.
The Community and Economic Development Department, after receiving the final Subdivision plat, shall indicate to the Subdivider whether altering the terrain or vegetation on the proposed Subdivision site may begin in preparation for Development of the proposed Subdivision.

7-13-703. BLOCKS.
(1) Lots having double Frontage shall not be approved except where necessitated by topographic or other unusual conditions. The width of each block shall be sufficient for an ultimate layout of two tiers of Lots therein of a size required by the provisions of this Title, unless the general layout of the vicinity, lines of Ownership, topographical conditions or locations of Arterial Streets or Freeways justify or make necessary a variation from this requirement.
(2) Blocks shall not exceed 1500 feet in length. In any block over 900 feet in length, there shall be a crosswalk or pedestrian way in accordance with The Transportation and Public Ways Ordinance.

7-13-704. LOTS.
(1) All Subdivisions shall result in the creation of Lots which are developable and capable of being built upon. A Subdivision shall not create Lots, and no building permit shall be issued for any Lots which would make improvement impractical due to size, shape, steepness of terrain, location of watercourses, problems of sewerage or driveway Grades, or other physical conditions.
(2) All Lots or parcels created by the Subdivision shall have access to a dedicated Street improved to standards hereinafter required. Private Streets shall not be permitted unless the Planning Commission finds that the most logical Development of the land requires that Lots be created which are served by a private Street or other means of access, and makes such findings in writing with the reasons stated therein. Land designated as public or private Right-of-way shall be separate and distinct from Lots adjoining such Right-of-way and not be included in the area of such Lots.
(3) The minimum area and dimensions of all Lots shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which the Subdivision is located.
(4) The side lines of all Lots, so far as possible, shall be at right angles to the Street which the Lot faces, or approximately radial to the center of curvatures, if such Street is curved. Side lines of Lots shall be approximately radial to the center of curvature of a Cul-de-sac on which the Lot faces. The Planning Commission may allow exceptions to this requirement where considerations for solar orientation are involved.
(5) Corner Lots for residential Use shall be platted ten feet wider than Interior Lots in order to permit conformance with the required Street setback requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
(6) A Lot shall not be divided by a City boundary. Any such boundary line shall be made a Lot line.
(7) Remnants of property shall not be left in the Subdivision which do not conform to Lot requirements or are not required or more suitable for a common open space, private utility or public purpose.
(8) Lot numbers shall begin with the number "1" and shall continue consecutively through the Subdivision, with no omissions or duplications; no block designations shall be used.
(9) Except for group dwellings and Planned Unit Developments, as specifically authorized by this Title and Title 9, not more than one Dwelling Unit shall occupy any one Lot.
(10) Flag Lots may be approved by the Planning Commission in any residential zone where, due to parcel dimension or configuration, traditional Lot design is not feasible. Such Lots shall meet the following criteria:
    a. The stem of the Lot shall be not less than 20 feet in width;
    b. The length of the stem shall be determined by the Planning Commission;
    c. The stem shall be hard surfaced in asphalt or concrete;
    d. The stem of the Lot shall have direct access to a dedicated Street;
    e. The Planning Commission may allow a stem to serve more than one Lot upon a determination that the most logical Development of the site necessitates such a design. If a stem is to serve more than 1 Lot, the stem portion shall be a minimum 24 feet in width;
    f. The design shall meet all City Fire Department requirements;
    g. The minimum Lot area of a flag Lot shall be no less than 12,000 square feet. For flag Lot consideration in the R-1-12, R-1-15, R-1-20 and Agricultural zones, the minimum Lot requirements of that particular zone shall apply. The stem area shall not be used in computing Lot size;
    h. All Lots resulting from the creation of a flag Lot shall have a Lot Width and Lot area no less than the minimum Lot Width and Lot area requirement of the underlying zone and shall be measured at the front setback line;
    i. To ensure proper storm water drainage, the developer shall submit a grading and drainage plan in conjunction with the Subdivision plat to be revised and approved by the City Public Works Department; and
    j. Flag Lots, including the stem portion, shall be held in fee simple Ownership.

7-13-705. STREETS.
(1) All Streets shall be designated and constructed with the appropriate Street classification requirements specified in the Transportation and Public Ways Ordinance. Additional Right-of-way and pavement widths may be required to accommodate bike lanes as shown on the West Valley City Bike Plan.

+----------------------+---------+----------------+----------------+-----------+-----------------+--------------+
(2) Where the potential impacts on the existing Street systems are considered to be great, or in the case of unique circumstances concerning access, topography or Street layout, a Transportation Planning/Engineering Study may be required.
(3) The following principles shall govern Street names in a Subdivision:
    a. Each Street which is a continuation of, or an approximate continuation of, any existing dedicated Street shall be given the name of such existing Street. When any Street forms a portion of a proposed Street previously ordered by the City Council to be surveyed, opened, widened or improved, the Street shall be given the name established in said Council order.
    b. The names of newly created Streets of a non-continuous or noncontiguous nature shall not duplicate or nearly duplicate the name of any Streets in the City or in the incorporated or unincorporated areas of Salt Lake County.
    c. The words "Street," "Avenue," "Boulevard," "Place," "Way," "Court," or other designation of any Street shall be spelled out in full on the plat and shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission. Any Street name incorporating one of the terms used above shall conform to the definition of that term as specified in the Transportation and Public Ways Ordinance. Any named Street shall also have the proper south or west coordinate as approved by the Public Works Department.
(4) Street patterns in the Subdivision shall be in conformity with the plan for the most advantageous Development of adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood or district. The following principles shall be observed:
    a. Where appropriate to the design and terrain, proposed Streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing planned or platted Streets with which they are to connect.
    b. Proposed Streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such extension is not desirable for the coordination of the Subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future Development of adjacent tracts.
    c. Dead-end Streets, intended as access to future Development parcels, shall be a maximum of one Lot depth in length. With Planning Commission approval, any dead-end Streets longer than one Lot depth shall have a minimum of a 40-foot radius temporary turnaround area with an all-weather surface and shall not exceed West Valley City engineering standards as established by the Public Works Department; provided, however, that the Street length shall be acceptable to the Planning Commission. Any Street exceeding West Valley City engineering standards for single-access Street length shall have at least two points of independent access.
    d. Whenever a dead-end Street is terminated at the boundary of property to be subdivided, the Street shall be extended and incorporated into the design of the Subdivision, unless the City shall determine that:
        i. Extension of the dead-end Street is not necessary for either the harmonious flow of traffic in the neighborhood and district, or to adequately provide water and sewer services, and storm drainage.
        ii. If it is determined that extension of the road is not necessary, the road shall be terminated with a Cul-de-sac as approved by the Public Works Department.
    e. Proposed Streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit. "T" intersections rather than "cross" intersections shall be used wherever possible for local Streets.
    f. Excessively long and straight connecting local residential Streets, conducive to high speed traffic, shall be prohibited according to the Planning Commission's judgment.
    g. Alleys shall not be permitted in residential Subdivisions except when approved for access to Lots abutting an Arterial. Alleys in nonresidential Subdivisions may be permitted.
    h. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed West Valley City engineering standards as established by the Public Works Department; provided, however that the Cul-de-sac length shall be acceptable to the Planning Commission. Cul-de-sacs are discouraged except where no other Development options exist. Driveways, mailboxes, fire hydrants, or any other obstruction at the terminal of a Cul-de-sac shall be designed in such a way as to provide an area for the piling of snow.
(5) Subdivisions adjacent to Arterials and Freeways shall be designed as specified in the Major Street Plan and as determined by the Planning Commission. The following principles and standards shall be observed:
    a. Street design shall have the purpose of making adjacent Lots, if for residential Use, desirable for such Use by cushioning the impact of heavy traffic and of minimizing the interference with traffic on Arterials. The number of intersecting Streets and driveways along Arterials shall be held to a minimum.
    b. Design of Lots abutting Arterial Streets shall conform to one of the following alternatives as determined by the Planning Commission:
        i. Lots may be platted on a semicircular bulb extending from the Arterial toward the Subdivision. The bulb shall be designed to accommodate one-way traffic with counter-clockwise circulation. Lots so platted shall conform to the design standards for Cul-de-sac Lots within the zone where the Subdivision is located, except that the minimum depth of such Lots shall be 110 feet.
        ii. Lots shall be platted along a Frontage Street which is separated from the Arterial Street by at least 10 feet of permanent Landscaping, subject to approval by the Planning Commission. Frontage roads shall enter Arterials by means of intersections, designed with turning and stacking capacity adequate for the traffic volume as estimated by the Planning Commission.
        iii. Double Frontage Lots shall be platted with a minimum depth of 120 feet. The minimum width of such Lots shall be consistent with that required of the zone. Access shall not be allowed from double Frontage Lots directly onto Arterial Streets. In cases where homes are sited on double Frontage Lots with the Rear Yard adjacent to the Arterial, a wall meeting one of the following standards shall be constructed abutting the Sidewalk:
            1. A six-foot-high solid decorative concrete or masonry wall; or
            2. Other wall designs, as proposed by the developer, may be considered by the Planning Commission.
            The type of wall shall be determined by the Planning Commission during the Preliminary Plat approval process, and the type of wall required shall be a condition of Preliminary Plat approval. Once the wall is installed by the developer and approved by the City in accordance with Subdivision requirements, the entire wall shall be maintained by the property Owner for that portion affecting their Lot. For private Developments, the Homeowner’s Association shall be responsible for maintenance of the wall. Walls adjacent to I-215, Mountain View Corridor, and Bangerter Highway are excluded from this provision. The wall shall be consistent throughout the Subdivision. On double Frontage Lots with walls in the Rear Yard, two trees shall be planted spaced 30 feet on center. The trees shall be placed such that when mature, the Canopy will overhang the wall. A minimum of 5 feet of Landscaping shall be installed between the wall and the Sidewalk and shall be maintained by the Homeowner’s Association.
        iv. Lots may be platted on Cul-de-sacs extending toward an Arterial from a minor collector within the Subdivision. When such Lots are platted on Cul-de-sacs, the standards listed in Section 7-13-705(5)(b)(ii) shall apply.
        v. At the Planning Commission's discretion, and in instances where the Planning Commission shall find that a masonry wall is unnecessary to mitigate noise, traffic, aesthetic, and/or public safety or other concerns, a solid visual barrier of materials other than masonry may be permitted on double Frontage Lots.
        vi. On Lots with available access only onto an Arterial, a circular drive or some other type of vehicular maneuvering area shall be provided to enable vehicles to enter traffic moving forward rather than backing. The minimum depth of such Lots shall be 120 feet and the minimum width shall be 85 feet.
        vii. When a design for a residential Subdivision creates Lots adjacent to an existing or proposed state Freeway, expressway, or highway in areas where high noise levels can be expected, a noise barrier meeting Utah Department of Transportation standards for noise attenuation is required.
    c. When any Lot borders an Arterial, the Subdivider may be required to execute and deliver to the City an instrument, deemed sufficient by the City Attorney's Office, prohibiting the right of ingress and egress from the Arterial to the Lot, and a legal document sufficient to guarantee maintenance of Landscaping. The Subdivider shall also be required to install such paving as necessary to construct the Arterial or to bring the Arterial up to standard width and shall install curb, gutter and Sidewalk, along the Arterial. However, the City may waive the requirement to install Sidewalk, if it finds it unnecessary.

7-13-706. PROTECTION STRIPS.
Protection Strips shall not be permitted under any circumstances, nor shall remnant parcels be permitted which may act as Protection Strips.

7-13-707. DEDICATION AND RESERVATION.
(1) Pursuant to Title 8 of the West Valley City Municipal Code, new Development is required to pay a park impact fee and other impact fees that are related to the impact a new Development places on the City and its resources.

(2) All land to be dedicated for park or recreational purposes shall be found to be suitable by the Planning Commission, the Community and Economic Development Department, and the Parks and Recreation Department as to location, parcel size and topography for the park and recreation purposes for which it is indicated in the General Plan. Such purposes may include active recreation facilities such as playgrounds, play fields, pedestrian or bicycle paths, areas of particular natural beauty and wooded areas to be developed or left in their natural state.
(3) When park or recreational facilities are proposed for dedication, a deed shall be conveyed to the City which shall be recorded with the Subdivision plat. When park or recreational facilities are reserved for private use, the developer shall establish conditions as to Ownership, maintenance and Use of such areas as deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to assure preservation of the intended Use.
(4) The provisions of this section shall not normally apply to Commercial or industrial Subdivisions; however, the Planning Commission may recommend as a condition of approval, that a Commercial or industrial Subdivider dedicate to the City that portion of a stream bed or drainage channel falling within an industrial Subdivision when such portion forms part of an open space network designated in the General Plan or a planned community plan.
(5) In addition to Subdivisions, the provisions of this Section requiring the payment of fees, or dedication in lieu of fees, shall apply to all residential Developments which require Conditional Use approval. Such Developments shall include, but not be limited to, Condominiums, Apartments, Planned Unit Developments, and Mobile Home Parks. The percentage of credit shall be determined by the Planning Commission prior to final approval of a Development Plan. The fee per unit shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit for each Dwelling Unit in the Development.

7-13-708. LANDSCAPING.
(1) Whenever, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the cuts and fills in a hillside Subdivision are of sufficient size or visibility to demand special treatment, the Subdivider shall be required to landscape such areas with suitable permanent plant materials and to provide for their maintenance.

7-14-600P PART 6 – AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONE

7-14-601. PURPOSE.
The Airport Overlay Zone is established to notify property Owners within the flight path of the Salt Lake City International Airport of the impacts associated with aircraft operation and to institute general safety requirements. The Salt Lake City International Airport provides a regional transportation link for the entire United States that is vital to the economic welfare of the region. Therefore, it has been determined that an Airport Overlay Zone should be established, which recognizes the impacts present outside of the Airport boundaries. Obstructions that affect the size available for landing, take off, and maneuvering of aircraft impair the utility of Airports and the public investment therein. Therefore, it is necessary in the interests of the health, safety, and general welfare of the public that an Airport Overlay Zone be established to prevent hazards, to the extent possible, by the exercise of police powers without compensation.

7-14-602. AIRPORT OVERLAY ZONE BOUNDARIES AND NAVIGATION EASEMENT.
There are defined flight paths to and from the Salt Lake City International Airport that traverse through West Valley City. This flight corridor shall constitute the Airport Overlay Zone, and shall be defined as the areas bounded by I-215 on the east, to 5600 West between 2100 South and 3100 South on the west, and by I-215 on the east, to 3600 West between 3100 South and the southern boundary of the City on the west. Prior to obtaining a building permit, any new construction (except remodeling) shall provide a navigation easement that notifies current and subsequent property Owners that their property is located within the flight corridor and may be subject to impacts generated by aircraft. The navigation easement grants perpetual rights to the Salt Lake City Airport Authority for the airspace above the land, for the free and unrestricted passage of all aircraft, to the extent that aircraft using Salt Lake City Airport Authority facilities do not exceed current federal guidelines, including any amendments, for Airport noise.

7-14-603. HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
No Structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained within the Airport Overlay Zone to a height in excess of the height limitations specified in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 77, "Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace." Those Structures exceeding 350 feet in height may be affected.

7-14-604. USE RESTRICTIONS.
Within the Airport Overlay Zone, no Use shall create any electrical interference with navigational signals for radio communications between the Airport and the aircraft, making it difficult for pilots to distinguish Airport lights and signals, causing glare in the eyes of pilots using the Airport, impairing visibility in the vicinity of the Airport, or otherwise in any way creating a hazard or endangering the landing, take off, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the Airport.

(2) The following impact fee schedules, found in Chapter 1-2 of the City Code, have been adopted by the City Council and are incorporated herein by reference:
    a. Drainage Impact Fee Schedule
    b. Park Impact Fee Schedule
    c. Road Impact Fee Schedule
    d. Fire Impact Fee Schedule
    e. Police Impact Fee Schedule
(3) The land uses specified in the impact fee schedules shall be interpreted as follows:
    a. "Single-Family Detached" shall be defined as the use of a lot for one dwelling unit, not attached to any other dwelling unit.
    b. "Duplex" shall be defined as "Dwelling, Two-Family," which is defined in Section 7-1-103(57).
    c. "Mobile Home Park" shall be defined as a development activity involving the leasing of sites for the temporary placement of mobile homes and/or recreational vehicles.
    d. "Multi-Family" shall include any dwelling unit that does not fit the definition of Single-Family Detached, Duplex, or Mobile Home Park.
    e. Nonresidential land uses in the Road Impact Fee Schedule and the Police Impact Fee Schedule shall be defined according to the descriptions of land uses in the most current edition of Trip Generation, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, provided that retail uses not separately identified shall be classified in the shopping center category, and institutional uses not separately identified shall be classified in the general office category.
(4) The units of development specified in the fee schedule shall be interpreted as follows:
    a. A dwelling shall be interpreted as "dwelling unit," as defined in Section 7-1-103(62), provided that it shall also be interpreted as the creation of a new mobile home or recreational vehicle space in a mobile home park.
    b. Building square footage shall be measured in terms of gross floor area, measured from the outside surfaces of the building walls.
(5) For categories of uses not specified in the applicable impact fee schedule, the Impact Fee Administrator shall apply the category of use set forth in the applicable fee schedule that is deemed to be most similar to the proposed use.
(6) If the development approval or permit for the proposed development indicates a mix of uses in the development, the impact fees shall be calculated separately for each use according to the fee schedule, and the results aggregated.
(7) For an addition to or remodeling or replacement of existing structures, or for a change of use of an existing structure, the impact fee to be paid shall be the difference, if any, between:
    a. The fee that would be payable for existing development on the site, or, in the case of demolition or removal of a structure, the previous development on the site, provided that the demolition or removal has occurred within one year of the date of submittal of the application for which impact fees are assessed; and
    b. The fee that would be payable for the total development on the site after the new development.
(8) Upon written request of an applicant, the Impact Fee Administrator shall provide an estimate of the current fee based on the data provided by the applicant. However, the Impact Fee Administrator shall not be responsible for determining at such preliminary date the accuracy of the information provided, nor shall such estimate provide any vested rights.

(5) The value of land dedicated or donated shall be based on the appraised land value of the parent parcel (which land value is based on the date of transfer of ownership to the City), as determined by a certified appraiser who was selected and paid for by the applicant and who used generally accepted appraisal techniques. If the City disagrees with the appraised value, the City may engage another appraiser at the City’ s expense, and the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals. If either party rejects the average of the two appraisals, a third appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being shared equally by the property owner and the City. The third appraiser shall be selected by the first two appraisers, and the third appraisal shall be binding on both parties.
(6) Offsets provided for qualifying improvements meeting the requirements of this section shall be valid from the date of approval until six years after the date of approval, or until the last date of construction within the project, whichever occurs first.
(7) The right to claim offsets shall run with the land and may be claimed only by owners of property within the development for which the qualifying improvement was required.
(8) Any claim for offsets must be made no later than the time of payment of building permit fees or payment for another permit subsequent to development plan approval that is subject to impact fees. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived.

Fee = persons per unit X occupancy factor X net cost per functional population, where "persons per unit" is the average number of persons residing in occupied dwelling units of the proposed housing type, adjusted by the average occupancy rate for the proposed housing type. "Occupancy factor" shall be 0.50, as identified in the adopted Capital Facilities Plan. "Net cost per functional population" shall be as identified in the adopted Capital Facilities Plan.
(2) The individual assessment for a nonresidential use shall include, without limitation, the following elements:
    a. A projection of the number of vehicular trips entering and departing from the project during an average weekday.
    b. The average number of persons occupying vehicles entering the project.
    c. The average number of hours spent by employees and visitors at the site during an average weekday.
    d. Once the appropriate land use, trip generation, and other factors have been determined, the impact fee shall be calculated using the following formula:
    Fee = functional population/1,000 sf X net cost per functional population, where "functional population/1,000 sf" equals employee hours/1,000 sf plus visitor hours/1,000 sf divided by 16 hours/day. "Employee hours/1,000 sf" equals employees/1,000 sf times 10 hrs/day; "visitor hours/1,000 sf" equals visitors/1,000 sf times 1 hour/visit; "visitors/1,000 sf" equals weekday ADT/1,000 sf times average vehicle occupancy minus employees/1,000 sf; "weekday ADT/1,000 sf" equals one-way average daily trips (total trip ends divided by 2). "Net cost per functional population" shall be as identified in the adopted Capital Facilities Plan.
    e. The assumptions and conclusions from which any projections are made. If the assumptions or conclusions are derived from the current edition of the ITE manual or other standard reference materials, the materials shall be identified, and appropriate excerpts or specific references provided. Otherwise, the reasoning underlying the assumptions and conclusions shall be clearly stated in writing.
    f. Such other information as the Impact Fee Administrator shall reasonably request.
(3) The Impact Fee Administrator shall determine the fee based on the review of the independent assessment and the guidelines and formulae described in the preceding Section 8-5-101, "Police Impact Fee Schedule," and Sections 8-5-102(1) and (2) above.
(Ord. No. 97-30 Enacted 07/01/1997)

8-6-103. USE OF POLICE IMPACT FEES.
(1) The revenues from police impact fees collected within the service area and accrued interest on such revenues shall be used to finance project costs of qualifying police improvements located within the same service area.
(2) Qualifying police improvements are limited to capital improvements with a useful life of ten years or more that are identified in the adopted Capital Facilities Plan for police impact fees.
(3) Police impact fee revenues may be used to pay for the acquisition or construction of buildings and associated land used to house the City’s police personnel and equipment, including the principal, interest, and other financing costs of bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by or in behalf of the City to finance qualifying improvements.
(4) Monies collected as police impact fees shall not be used to pay for any of the following:
    a. Construction, acquisition, or expansion of public facilities other than qualifying police improvements; or
    b. Replacement, repair, operation, or maintenance of existing police facilities or capital equipment.

    a. Development. The Planning Commission may require arrangements of structures, open spaces, landscaping, buffering, and access within the development as necessary. The Commission may require specific setbacks, a lower residential density, a height limitation, and/or a similar type of land use as adjoining land. These criteria shall be used by the Commission to assure that adjacent properties will not be adversely affected by the development and that the development will be compatible with the land use in the surrounding area.
    b. Construction Materials. Quality exterior materials including brick, stone, stucco, or other materials of similar high quality, durability, and low maintenance may be provided, as accepted by the Planning Commission.
    c. Interior Amenities. Quality interior provisions, including amenities such as a fireplace, vaulted ceilings, and in-unit washer/dryer hookups.
    d. Fencing. Exterior fencing shall include architecturally designed brick or block fences, wrought iron fences, structural wood fences, vinyl fences, or a combination of these materials.
    e. Parking. Covered parking and/or garages may be required for all units.
    f. Pedestrian and Bicycle Paths. Where appropriate, the internal circulation system shall provide pedestrian and bicycle paths that are physically separated from vehicular traffic to serve residential, non-residential, and recreational facilities in or adjacent to the development.
    g. Privacy. Each development shall provide reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for dwelling units. Fences, insulation, walks, barriers, landscaping, and sound reducing construction techniques shall be used for the enhancement of property and the privacy of its occupants.
    h. Security. The development may be designed to support security services, taking into account public safety recommendations from the West Valley City Police Department.
    i. Landscaping. The development site may be landscaped and should be composed of natural landscaping elements, including lawn, shrubs, ground covers, and a combination of evergreen and deciduous trees.
    j. Home Owner's Association. The development may be approved subject to the submission and approval of legal instruments setting forth a plan or manner of permanent care and maintenance of all common open space and other facilities provided in the final development plan. No such instrument shall be acceptable until approved by the City Attorney as to legal form and effect, and the Planning Commission as to suitability for the proposed use of the common open space and subject facilities.
    k. Recreational Amenities. Each development may provide recreation or site amenities, including, but not limited to, clubhouse, pool, tennis courts, sport courts, playgrounds, play fields, and nature areas.
(3) The final development plan shall be prepared by a design team composed of an architect, a landscape architect, and an engineer or land surveyor, all licensed to practice in the State of Utah.
(4) Residential density as measured by dwelling units per acre within a condominium development may exceed that permitted by the underlying zone up to a maximum of 20 percent, provided that the density does not exceed the maximum recommended in the West Valley City Master Plan. The Planning Commission and the City Council both must find, however, that any increase in density will be compensated by increased amenities and improved design which, in its opinion, are proportional to the density increase which it authorizes.
(5) Dedication and improvement of streets shall be made in accordance with the Major Street Plan of the City and further as may be determined by the City Council upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission for special circumstances where it is necessary to serve the vehicular and pedestrian needs of the proposed development and of the City. Said streets shall be constructed to standards set forth for various classes of streets by the City and shall be dedicated to the City as public streets. In instances of severe topography, security requirements or other special circumstances which make dedication or development to City standards impractical or undesirable, the City Council, upon recommendation of the Planning Commission, may allow development of streets to special standards specifically approved as part of the final development plan. Maintenance and repair of non-dedicated streets shall be the perpetual responsibility of the Owners Association, it being understood that this responsibility shall not be borne by the City or any other governmental agency or body.
(6) With the following exceptions, dwellings and permitted structures may be located as approved in the final development plans. Locations and arrangements of buildings on the lot should be accomplished in a manner that will best utilize the lot area and create an attractive living environment. The following exceptions shall be considered as minimum requirements as they apply:
    a. Garages with entrances facing directly on public streets, whether in a front or side yard, shall be setback at least 20 feet from such streets.
    b. Setbacks shall be maintained along the peripheral property lines of the planned development which shall be equal to that required by the zone on the property immediately adjacent thereto. Buildings located on the periphery of the development shall be limited to a maximum height of two stories.
    c. In those instances where a proposed condominium development will front upon one or more existing streets, the setback from the street shall be equal to that required by the most restrictive zoning on property immediately adjacent along the same street frontage.
(7) Open space and recreation requirements. Each project shall meet the following standards for open space and recreational areas:
    a. Open space shall be provided and shall not be less than 50 percent of the site area in residential condominiums which contain multiple unit structures having three or more units per structure. Residential condominiums which consist of structures containing two or less units shall provide not less than 40 percent open space. The required open space shall be land areas that are not occupied by buildings, structures, parking areas, streets, alleys or required setbacks. Said open space shall be devoted to landscaping, preservation of natural features, patios and recreational areas and facilities. Reduction may be made to this percentage of required open space by the Planning Commission and upon a showing that the open space in the site area will provide amenities; which will substantially meet the needs of future residents.
    b. Common open space shall comprise at least 50 percent of the required open space and shall be so designed for uses including, but not limited to, recreational, park or environmental amenity for common enjoyment and use by all residents.
    c. Open space in commercial and industrial condominiums shall be not less than 15 percent of the total site. Reduction may be made to this percentage of required open space by the Planning Commission if it can be demonstrated that proposed plan will still achieve the objectives of this Title if the reduction is allowed.
    d. Preservation, maintenance, and ownership of required open space within the development shall be accomplished by granting to City a permanent open space easement on or over the said private open spaces to guarantee that the open spaces remain perpetually in recreational use with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of the owner or an Owner's Association established with articles of incorporation and bylaws which are satisfactory to City.
(8) Rental of Condominium Unit. The developer, or owner of property on which the condominium development is located, shall not lease more than 20 percent (20%) of individual units. Legal instruments setting forth this requirement shall be reviewed and approved by the City Attorney prior to development approval.
(Ord. No. 97-09 Amended 03/13/1997)

9-4-106. CONSTRUCTION LIMITATIONS.

(2) Amendments to approved plans and specifications for a condominium development shall be approved by the Planning Commission and shown on the approved plans.
(3) The Building Inspector or any other City department shall not issue any permit for any proposed building, structure, activity or use within the project unless such building, structure, activity or use is in accordance with the approved development plan and any conditions imposed in conjunction with its approval.

(Ord. No. 97-57 Enacted 09/09/1997)

10-1-102. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.
The City Council of West Valley City finds that the enforcement of the West Valley City Municipal Code and applicable state codes throughout the City is an important public service. Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the public's health, safety, and quality of life. The City Council recognizes that enforcement starts with the drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied in administrative code enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The City Council further finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain compliance with these regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative code enforcement action may require the City Attorney to file a judicial action to gain compliance.
(Ord. No. 97-57 Enacted 09/09/1997)

10-1-103. SCOPE.
The provisions of this Title may be applied to all violations of the City Code. It has been designed as an additional remedy for the City to use in achieving compliance of its ordinances.

10-1-104. EXISTING LAW CONTINUED.
The provisions of this Title do not invalidate any other title or ordinance, but shall be read in conjunction with those titles and ordinances as an additional remedy available for enforcement of those ordinances.
(Ord. No. 97-57 Enacted 09/09/1997)

10-1-105. CRIMINAL PROSECUTION RIGHT.
The City has sole discretion in deciding whether to file a civil or criminal case for the violation of any of its ordinances. The City may choose to file both, or one or the other. The enactment of this administrative remedy shall in no way interfere with the City's right to prosecute City ordinance violations as criminal offenses. The City may use any of the remedies available under the law in both civil and criminal prosecution. If the City chooses to file both civil and criminal charges for the same day of violation, no civil penalties may be assessed, but all other remedies are available.

10-1-106. EFFECT OF HEADING.

The City hereby asserts that it has complied with the State legislative prerequisites for adoption of a policy declaration.
(Ord. No. 08-03 Amended 01/24/2008)

13-1-102. MAP SHOWING THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE EXTENT OF WEST VALLEY CITY'S BOUNDARIES AND AREAS THAT ARE MORE READILY AVAILABLE FOR SERVICE.
(1) This portion of West Valley City's Master Annexation Policy Declaration describes the geographic areas considered most favorable for future City expansion.
(2) The map (see Appendix "A") visually displays the existing boundaries of West Valley City in a heavy black line and the future boundaries by a shaded line. The future boundaries extend south from the existing southern boundary of West Valley City along the western boundary of Taylorsville-Bennion to 6200, then west along 6200 South to 5600 West, then south along 4800 West to 6600 South, then west along a line extending from 6600 South to the ridge top of the Oquirrh Mountain Range. The line continues north along the ridge top to 2400 South, then east to the west line of Section 21, Township 1 South, Range 2 West. At that point, the future boundary will follow the west line of Section 21 to the north line of Section 21 and then east along that line to the western boundary of West Valley City. The shaded line represents a large rectangular area of about 52 square miles. The existing City boundaries encompass an area of approximately 34 square miles.
(3) The Kearns area is also included as a future annexation area.
(4) The unincorporated area known as Magna is also included as a future annexation area.
(Ord. No. 96-22 Amended 04/26/1996)

13-1-103. CRITERIA AS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW, TOGETHER WITH ADDITIONAL CRITERIA AND POLICIES FOR CITY ACCEPTANCE OF AN ANNEXATION.
The City shall follow and comply with the State law for annexation.
(Ord. No. 96-22 Amended 04/26/1996; Ord. No. 08-03 Amended 01/24/2008)

13-1-104. THE CHARACTER OF THE COMMUNITY.
The areas anticipated for future annexation contain a wide variety of land uses. There is much agricultural land, as well as residentially-developed property, and property developed and being developed for commercial and industrial uses. The areas known as Magna and Kearns are a part of the proposed future boundaries. Alliant Techsystems Inc., and Kennecott Utah Copper, Inc., separately own considerable portions of the proposed City boundaries in the southwest annexation area.
The City was incorporated in July of 1980 and has entertained several proposals for annexation since that time. Interest in annexation has been shown by many surrounding property owners. This policy declaration will help to define those areas which the City will consider in a favorable manner.
(Ord. No. 96-22 Amended 04/26/1996)

13-1-105. THE NEED FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES IN DEVELOPING UNINCORPORATED AREAS.
The City realizes that municipal services to developed areas which may be annexed should, to the greatest extent possible, be provided by the City. It may, however, take some time to negotiate service agreements in developed areas. Certain utilities and areas of the City are currently served in this manner.
For developing unincorporated areas to be annexed to the City, general government services and public safety service will be provided by the City as the area is annexed and developed. Where feasible and in the public interest to the citizens of the City, public utility services will be provided through the appropriate utility companies or improvement districts.
Subsequent policy declarations on individual parcels will address provision of utility service to that particular area. Determination of how utility service will be provided to developing areas proposed for annexation will be developed following discussion with the Public Works Department and other appropriate utility officials or entities.

13-1-106. FINANCING AND TIME FRAME FOR THE EXTENSION OF MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
Those areas identified in this Master Policy Declaration as being favorable for annexation are located near to the City. A basic network of collector roads presently exists in many of these areas and the City can readily extend such services as police and fire protection, street maintenance, garbage collection and general government services. Unless otherwise specified, City services for police and fire protection, street maintenance and garbage collection will begin in newly-annexed areas immediately following the effective date of annexation.
Services for newly-annexed areas will be provided for out of the General Fund. However, it is the City's policy that all new development in areas requiring service bear the burden of providing necessary facilities. If and when the property sought to be annexed is developed, the developer will have to construct and install appropriate municipal service facilities such as streets, curb, gutter, sidewalk, water and sewer lines.

(1) Residents of the City have an inalienable interest in their personal safety, well-being, and privacy in their residences, as well as their ability to provide or receive information regarding matters of personal belief, political or charitable activities, and goods and services lawfully in commerce. The City has a substantial interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, personal safety, and privacy of its citizens, which includes the ability to protect citizens from unwanted intrusions upon residential property. The City also has a substantial interest in protecting citizens from fraud or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices as well as criminal activity.
(2) There must be a balance between these substantial interests of the City and its citizens, and the effect of the regulations in this Chapter on the rights of those who are regulated. Based on the collective experiences of City officials derived from regulating business activity, protecting persons and property from criminal conduct, responding to the inquiries of citizens regarding door-to-door solicitation, the experience of its law enforcement officers and those affected by door-to-door canvassing and solicitation, as well as judicial decisions outlining the boundaries of constitutional protections afforded and denied persons seeking to engage in door-to-door solicitation, the City adopts this Chapter to promote the City’s substantial interests in:
    a. Respecting citizen’s decisions regarding privacy in their residences;
    b. Protecting persons from criminal conduct;
    c. Providing equal opportunity to advocate for and against religious belief, political position, or charitable activities; and
    d. Permitting truthful and non-misleading door-to-door solicitation regarding lawful goods or services in intrastate or interstate commerce.
(3) The City finds that the procedures, rules and regulations set forth in this Chapter are narrowly tailored to preserve and protect the City interests referred to herein while at the same time balancing the rights of those regulated.

(3) Those responsible persons or entities associated with registered solicitors need not apply for, nor obtain, any other license, permit, or registration from the City, provided they do not establish a temporary or fixed place of business in the City.
(4) Nothing herein is intended to interfere with or supplant any other requirement of federal, state, or other local government law regarding any license, permit, or certificate that a registered solicitor is otherwise required to have or maintain.

(1) At the discretion of the Division, any Permittee may be allowed to provide an improvement bond to guarantee the construction or maintenance of any improvements required or permitted to be constructed under the provisions of this Title. All bonds, sureties or deposits (collectively referred to as a “bond”) allowed by the Division shall be filed with the City and shall guarantee the performance of all construction and/or the payment of all fees required under the terms of this Title. Said bond shall be accompanied by an agreement in a form approved by the City Attorney’s Office. The agreement shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
    a. All data required to compute the cost of the improvements by the Public Works Department.
    b. Completion of the improvements within a period of time not to exceed 2 years from the date the agreement is executed, the time period may be extended upon approval of the Division.
    c. The improvements shall be completed to the satisfaction of the Public Works Department and according to City standards as established by the Division, and in accordance with the most current version of the APWA Utah Chapter Manual of Standard Specifications adopted by the City Council.
    d. The bond amount shall be equal to the Division’s estimated cost of the public improvements to be installed, plus the product of the current annual inflation rate, times the number of years the bond will be in effect, times the estimated cost of the public improvements to be installed.
    e. The City shall have exclusive control over the bond proceeds and they may be released only upon written approval of the City.
    f. The bond proceeds may be reduced upon request as the improvements are installed. The amount of the reduction shall he determined by the Division. Such requests may be made only once every 30 days and no reductions shall be authorized until such time as the Division has inspected the improvements and found them to be in compliance with City standards. No partial release shall constitute acceptance of the improvements by the City. Acceptance by the City shall not occur until all improvements are completed, inspected by the City in their completed condition, and are, in their entirety, accepted by written notice from the City to the Permittee.
    g. If the bond proceeds are inadequate to pay the cost of the completion of the improvements according to City standards for whatever reason, including previous reductions, then the Permittee shall be responsible for the deficiency and no further building permits shall be issued to the Permittee until such improvements are completed or a new bond has been executed to insure completion of the remaining improvements.
    h. In all cases, 20 percent of the bond amount for such improvements shall extend for a one-year period beyond the date the construction is completed to guarantee replacement of defects. The Permittee or Person posting the bond shall be responsible for any substandard improvements if the 20 percent proceeds are inadequate. Said 20 percent bond may be posted by the Person actually constructing the improvements, upon approval by the Division.
    i. If, upon written demand of the City after expiration of the time period specified in the bond agreement, the bond proceeds are not transferred to the City within 30 days of the demand, then the City’s costs of obtaining the proceeds, including the City Attorney’s Office costs or outside attorney’s fees and court costs, shall be deducted from the bond proceeds.
    j. Upon receipt of the bond proceeds, after the expiration of the time period specified in the bond agreement, the costs of completion shall include reimbursement to the Public Works Department and all other City departments for the costs of administration of the completion of the improvements, and costs of obtaining the bond proceeds as outlined in (I) above.
    k. The Permittee agrees to hold the City harmless from any and all liability which may arise as a result of the improvements which are installed until one year after the City accepts the improvements.
(2) At the discretion of the Division, any of the following types of bonds may be acceptable:
    a. A surety bond with a surety company licensed to do business in the State of Utah.
    b. An Irrevocable Letter of Credit issued by a federally or State insured financial institution.
    c. A cashier’s check, cash, personal or company check, or a money market certificate made payable only to the City.
(3) The time period for the completion of the required improvements may be extended in the following manner:
    a. Upon approval of the Division and City Manager, the time period may be extended an additional two years from the expiration date of the original bond agreement.
    b. All approvals of extensions of the bond agreement shall be in a form approved by the City Attorney’s Office and in compliance with all the provisions of this Chapter.
    c. Any additional extensions of the bond agreement shall be by approved by the City Council.

All highways, roads, paths, and ways within the City that are not designated as federal, state, special highways, roads, paths, or ways shall be under the direction and authority of the City Council.

(2) The Department may, subject to the approval of the City Manager, implement and administer a program for granting permits allowing access onto limited-access facilities, provided however, that such permits shall only be granted if the access is in keeping with the City Council's intent in designating the limited-access facility.

(2) Said prohibitions may be imposed due to the potential for serious damage, deterioration, or destruction to the street itself or to the potential harm or injury to traffic or pedestrians on or along said street.
(Ord. No. 00-12 Amended 02/24/2000)

19-2-213. POSTING OF PROHIBITIONS.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the City Manager determine that it is necessary to invoke the aforementioned authority, said signage may be substituted with written notice to the affected vehicle owners and/or drivers or by the placement of peace officers at appropriate locations to notify persons of the prohibitions or limitations until such time as appropriate signage can be erected.

Prohibitions or limitations may be imposed in any manner and to any extent deemed necessary by the City Manager after recommendation of the Public Works Director, Chief of Police, Fire Chief, or any other City department, including restricting the weight, size, hours of operation, types of vehicles, season of use, or any other designation deemed necessary.

In the regular City Council meeting immediately following any action taken pursuant to this Chapter, the City Manager shall advise the City Council, by use of the consent calendar, of said action taken. The City Council shall then have the prerogative to ratify or strike down the prohibitions or limitations imposed or any actions taken by the City Manager.
(2) Should the City Council decide to strike down the City Manager's action, said decision shall not in any way affect the authority of the City Manager to impose future regulations and shall not be evidence of inappropriate action taken by the City Manager.
(3) At any time after the imposition of any of the aforementioned limitations, prohibitions, or other actions by the City Manager, the City Council shall have the authority to direct the City Manager to modify said limitations, prohibitions, or other actions in any manner deemed necessary by the City Council.

(2) Service vehicles in the normal course of their repair and/or maintenance work on public utilities; or
(3) Any vehicle, truck, or other equipment, the operation of which on any regulated street has been exempted by the City Manager. Said exemption shall be based upon the posting of a bond or other assurance acceptable to the City Manager that any damage done to the road shall be remedied. The amount of damage done to the street and the bond or other assurance amount shall be determined by the City Manager. In no case, however, shall any vehicle, truck, or other equipment be allowed to operate, irrespective of the operator's desire to post the above assurances, if it is determined by the City Manager that the operation of such will be unduly detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of the City and/or its citizens or will otherwise adversely affect the best interests of the citizenry of the City. Said exemption and any bond related thereto shall be subject to City Council ratification as set forth in this Chapter.

19-2-218. PENALTIES.
(1) Unless otherwise provided herein or by state or federal law, a violation of this Title shall be a Class B misdemeanor. Each day that the violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense, and shall be punishable as such.
(2) Failure to fulfill all conditions imposed by a permit granted under authority of this Title, or any applicable condition imposed by the City Code, the City Council, Planning Commission, or Board of Adjustment constitutes a violation of this Title.
(Ord. No. 99-39 Enacted 07/09/1999)

19-2-219. ENFORCEMENT.
(1) The Public Works Department shall enforce all of the provisions of this Title, employing all legal means available to do so. The Public Works Director may designate any Department employee as an enforcement official.
    a. Any employee designated as an enforcement official is authorized to enter upon any property or premises to ascertain whether the provisions of the City Code are being obeyed and to make any examinations and surveys as may be necessary in the performance of the employee’s enforcement duties. This may include the taking of photographs, samples, or other physical evidence.
    b. All inspections, entries, examinations, and surveys shall be done in a reasonable manner based upon cause. If the property owner or person responsible for the property refuses to allow the employee to enter the property, the employee may obtain and execute a search warrant.
(2) Unless otherwise provided, this Title may be enforced through the Administrative Code Enforcement Hearing Program established in Title 10 of the City Code, or by filing civil or criminal actions as provided by law. The City has sole discretion to decide whether to file a civil or criminal case for a violation. The City may file both, or one or the other. The possibility of an administrative remedy pursuant to Title 10 shall in no way interfere with the City’s right to prosecute violations of this Title as criminal offenses, or to seek any civil remedy to enjoin, prevent, or abate the violation. The City may use any of the remedies available under the law in both civil litigation and criminal prosecution. If the City chooses to file both civil and criminal charges for the same violation on the same day, no civil fines shall be assessed, but all other remedies shall be available.
(Ord. No. 99-39 Enacted 07/09/1999)

In such emergency situations, the excavating parties must contact the Department on the first working day following the excavation and complete and secure a formal permit. None of the provisions of these specifications are waived for emergency situations, except for prior permit requirement.

Such insurance shall have as surety a corporation licensed to do business in the State of Utah as a surety company.

20-1-101. INTENT.
The City finds that the continuation and development of cable television and communications systems has great benefit and impact upon the residents of West Valley City. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the City further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the City or such persons as the City shall designate. It is the City's intent in granting this Franchise to insure that City residents receive a high quality cable television and communications service comparable to the best offered in any surrounding community in Salt Lake County; that any inconvenience to residents in the development and maintenance of the system be minimized; and that the City is properly compensated for the administration of this Franchise and the use of the public facilities permitted by this Chapter. It is the intent of this Chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters, and the Franchise issued pursuant to this Chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

20-1-104. POLICE POWER.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as an abrogation by the City of any of its lawful police powers.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-105. GRANT OF FRANCHISE.
(1) Grantor hereby grants to Grantee a nonexclusive, revocable Franchise to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct, a Cable Communications System within the City. The Franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a Cable Communications System as required by the provisions of this Chapter.
    a. This Franchise is granted under the terms and conditions contained herein and is intended to be consistent with federal laws and regulations and state general laws and regulations.
    b. The Franchise granted is hereby made subject to the general City Code provisions now in effect or hereafter made effective. Nothing in this Franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the other codes and ordinances of the Grantor regarding permits, fees to be paid or manner of construction. The Grantee agrees to abide by any existing or new ordinances or regulations, adopted in the manner provided by law, so long as they do not substantially impair the rights granted pursuant to this Franchise.
(2) The term of this new Franchise and all rights, privileges, obligations, and restrictions pertaining thereto shall remain in effect through July 1, 2010, unless terminated sooner as hereinafter provided.
(3) Renewal shall be conducted pursuant to applicable law in effect at that time, which is currently Section 626 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984.
(4) The Franchise granted is nonexclusive. The Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional Franchises for a Cable Communications System as it deems appropriate, provided however, that such additional grants shall not operate to materially modify, revoke, or terminate any rights previously granted to any Grantee. The material provisions of such additional Franchises shall be reasonably comparable to those of the existing Franchises in order that an unfair competitive advantage is not granted to one operator over another.
(5) Subject to federal law, no Cable Communications System shall be allowed to occupy or use the streets or operate within the City without being granted a Franchise.
(6) Subject to federal law, the Grantor may establish appropriate requirements of new Franchises or Franchise renewals, and may modify these requirements from time to time to reflect the future cable related community needs and interests, taking into account the costs of meeting such needs and interest.
(7) The Grantor may grant a Franchise for all or any defined portion of the City.
(8) All new Franchise applications and renewal applications, subject to federal law, when filed shall be available for public inspection at places designated by the Grantor. Information identified by Grantee or an applicant as "proprietary and confidential" shall not be disclosed by City without Grantee's or the applicant's consent, except to the extent state law or any City ordinance adopted pursuant to state law require its disclosure. Grantor may grant or may decline to grant any Franchise.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-106. AUTHORITY FOR USE OF STREETS.
For the purposes of operating and maintaining a Cable Communications System in the City, Grantee may erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the streets within the City such lines, cable, conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the Cable System, provided that all applicable permits are applied for and granted, all fees paid and all other City codes and ordinances are otherwise complied with.
(1) Prior to construction or alteration, Grantee shall in each case file plans with all appropriate departments and utility companies and receive written approval of such plans, which approval by City departments shall not be unreasonably withheld. Issuance of excavation, construction or similar permits as required by ordinance shall constitute such written approval.
(2) Grantee shall construct and maintain a Cable Communications System so as not to interfere with other uses of streets. Grantee shall make use of existing poles and other facilities available to Grantee. Grantee shall make reasonable best efforts to individually notify all residents affected by proposed construction in writing prior to the commencement of that work, provided that such prior notification will not unnecessarily delay repair or restoration of existing services or slow expeditious remedy of unsafe conditions.
(3) Notwithstanding the above grant to use streets, no street shall be used by Grantee if City, in its sole option, determines that such use is inconsistent with the terms, conditions or provisions by which such street was created or dedicated, or presently used.
(4) Nothing contained herein should be construed as granting to Grantees any rights whatsoever to the use of any private property without the consent of the owner thereof unless such is permitted by Section 54-4-13, Utah Code Annotated (1953), as amended.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-107. CONDITIONS ON STREET OCCUPANCY.
All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the Grantee within the City shall be located so as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, alleys, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who join any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
(1) Grantee shall repair or replace, at its own expense, any and all rights of way, pavements, sidewalks, street improvements, excavations, other facilities, landscaping or other improvements, public or private, used or damaged in the Franchise operations, including construction, installation, and maintenance thereof. Such repair or replacement shall return the property to as good or better condition as it was prior to the work being done.
(2) The Grantee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public ways and places of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the Grantee.
    a. Grantee shall notify City at least 72 hours before doing significant trimming. In the event of an emergency where immediate significant trimming is needed to restore existing services or remedy an unsafe condition, Grantee, after making or attempting oral notification to the Public Works Department of the City, may trim the trees, but only the minimum necessary to restore the service or remedy the unsafe condition. The City may use inspectors to observe the Grantee's trimming of the trees to ensure that it is done properly.*
    b. The Grantee shall make a reasonable best effort, including written notice, to notify owners of property adjacent to the trees to be trimmed at least 72 hours prior to doing the work.
    c. As used herein, "significant trimming" is any trimming of trees beyond minor cuts that do not substantially change the aesthetic character of the tree or damage or injure the tree.
    d. For all trimming, the Grantee shall use generally accepted pruning standards of modern arboriculture.
(3) The Grantee shall hold harmless the City and its officers, agents, and employees from and against any and all damages arising out of or resulting from the removal, trimming, mutilation of or any injury to any tree or trees proximately caused by the Grantee or its officers, agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)
* Code reviser’s note: This subsection was amended at the City’s request in March 2018 to remove an invalid cross-reference.

20-1-108. ERECTION OF POLES.
(1) The Franchise shall not be deemed to expressly or impliedly authorize the Grantee to construct or install poles or wire-holding structures within streets for the purpose of placing cables, wires, lines or otherwise, without the written consent of the City. Such consent shall be given upon such terms and conditions as the City Council in its sole discretion may prescribe which shall include a requirement that the Grantee perform, at its sole expense, all tree trimming required to maintain the poles, cable and wires clear of obstructions.
(2) With respect to any poles or wire-holding structures which Grantee is authorized to construct and install within streets, a public utility or public utility district serving the City may, if denied the privilege of utilizing such pole or wire-holding structures by the Grantee, apply for such permission to the City Council. If the City Council finds that such use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the Grantee's present and future operations, the City Council may authorize such use subject to such terms and conditions as may reasonably be agreed upon by the parties. Such authorization shall include the condition that the public utility or public utility district pay to the Grantee any and all actual and necessary costs incurred by the Grantee in permitting such use and shall indemnify the Company from and against any claims or causes of action brought about due to such use.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-109. UNDERGROUNDING.
(1) Except as hereinafter provided, in all areas of the City where the cables, wires and other like facilities of a public utility or public utility district are placed underground, Grantee shall construct and install its cables, wires and other facilities underground. Amplifier boxes and pedestal mounted terminal boxes may be placed above ground if existing technology reasonably requires, but shall be of such size and design and shall be located so as to minimize visual and physical impact on adjacent yards and landscapes insofar as it is technically and economically feasible and not unsafe. In any area of the City where there are certain cables, wires and other like facilities of a public utility or public utility district suspended above the ground from poles, a Grantee may construct and install its cables, wires and other facilities from the same poles.
(2) With respect to any cables, wires and other like facilities constructed and installed by a Grantee above ground, the Grantee shall, at its sole expense, reconstruct and install such cables, wires or other facilities underground pursuant to any project under which the cables, wires or other like facilities of such utilities are placed underground within an area. The duty of a Grantee to place its cables, wires and other facilities underground shall arise only if all like facilities of utilities which are existing above ground are placed underground, provided however, a Grantee is given reasonable notice of such event so that it may place its facilities underground in conjunction with the utility.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-110. RELOCATION.
(1) If during the term of the Franchise the City, a publicly owned utility, a public water district, a public sanitation district, a public drainage district or any other similar special public district elects to alter, repair, realign, abandon, improve, vacate, reroute or change the grade of any street or to replace, repair, install, maintain, or otherwise alter any above ground or underground cable, wire, conduit, pipe, line, pole, wire-holding structure, structure, or other facility utilized for the provision of utility or other services or transportation of draining, sewage or other liquids, the Grantee, shall, except as provided in Section 20-1-110(2) or as otherwise provided by law, at its sole expense, remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and any other facilities which it has installed.
(2) If such removal or relocation is required within the subdivision in which all utility lines, including those for the Cable Television System, were installed at the same time, the entities may decide among themselves who is to bear the cost of relocation; provided that the City shall not be liable to a Grantee for such costs. Regardless of who bears the costs, Grantee shall take action to remove or relocate upon reasonable notice at such time or times as are directed by the agency or company undertaking the work. Reasonable advance written notice shall be mailed to the Grantee advising the Grantee of the date or dates removal or relocation is to be undertaken.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-111. MOVEMENT OF BUILDINGS.
Grantee shall, upon request by any person holding a building moving permit, Franchise or other approval issued by the City or State of Utah, temporarily remove, raise, or lower its wire to permit the movements of buildings. The expense of such removal, raising or lowering shall be paid by the person requesting same, and Grantee shall be authorized to require such payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours oral or written notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-112. REQUIRED EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE.
(1) Grantee is hereby authorized to extend the Cable System as necessary, desirable, or as required pursuant to the terms hereof within the City. However, at the effective date of this Franchise, the Grantee was capable of providing service to 90 percent of the City residents. Grantee shall develop the system such that 85 percent of the City residents are always capable of being served by the Grantee. However, Grantee's obligation to maintain the percentage shall be subject to Section 20-1-112(2).
(2) Whenever Grantee shall receive a request for service from at least fifteen (15) Subscribers within 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its Cable System to such Subscribers at no cost to said Subscribers; provided that such extension is technically feasible, and will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the Cable System, or as provided for under Section 20-1-112(3) of this Chapter.
(3) No Subscriber shall be refused service arbitrarily.
(4) For unusual circumstances, such as a Subscriber's request to locate his cable drop underground, the existence of more than one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to Subscribers, or a density of less than fifteen (15) Subscribers per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, Cable Service or other service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution to be borne by Grantee and Subscribers in the area in which Cable Service may be expanded, Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of potential Subscribers per 1320 cable-bearing stand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals fifteen (15) Subscribers. Potential Subscribers will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential Subscribers be paid in advance.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-113. CITY BUILDINGS PROVIDED SERVICE.
The Grantee shall provide, without charge, one (1) outlet of expanded basic service to each governmental building, including but not limited to fire stations, police substations, and public and non-profit private school buildings that are passed by its Cable System. The outlets of expanded basic service shall not be used to sell Cable Services in or throughout such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in common or public areas open to the public. The distribution of the cable facility inside such building and the extent thereof shall be the option, duty and expense or the building owner. Users of such outlets shall hold Grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such outlets, including but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop line from the feeder cable to the building exceeds one hundred fifty (150) cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and so long as it will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the Cable System to do so, or unless the City agrees to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable feet. In the event that additional outlets of extended basic service are provided to such buildings, the City may also be required to pay the service fees associated with the provision of extended basic service and the additional outlets relating thereto.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-114. REMOVAL.
(1) Upon expiration or termination of the Franchise, if the Franchise is not renewed and if neither the City nor an assignee purchased the Cable Television System, the Grantee may remove any underground cable from the streets which has been installed in such a manner that it can be removed without trenching or other opening of the streets along the extension of cable to be removed. The Grantee shall not remove any underground cable or conduit which requires trenching or other opening of the streets along the extension of cable to be removed, except as hereinafter provided. Subject to federal law, the Grantee shall remove, at its sole cost and expense, any underground cable or conduit by trenching or opening of the streets along the extension thereof or otherwise which is ordered to be removed by the City Council based upon a determination, in the sole discretion of the City, that removal is required in order to eliminate or prevent a hazardous condition or promote future utilization of the streets for public purposes. Any order by the City Council to remove cable or conduit shall be mailed to the Grantee not later than ninety (90) calendar days following the date of expiration of the Franchise. A Grantee shall file written notice with the City Recorder not later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of expiration or termination of the Franchise of its intention to remove cable and a schedule for removal by location. The schedule and timing of removal shall be subject to approval and regulation by the City. Removal shall be completed not later than twelve (12) months following the date of expiration of the Franchise. Underground cable and conduit in the streets which is not removed shall be deemed abandoned and title thereto shall be vested in the City.
(2) Upon expiration or termination of the Franchise, if the Franchise is not renewed and if neither the City nor an assignee purchased the System, the Grantee, at its sole expense, shall, subject to federal law unless relieved of the obligation by the City, remove from the streets all above ground elements of the Cable Television System, including but not limited to amplifier boxes, pedestal mounted terminal boxes, and cable attached to or suspended from poles, which are not purchased by the City or its assignee.
(3) The Grantee shall apply for and obtain such encroachment permits, licenses, authorizations or other approvals and pay such fees and deposit such security as required by applicable ordinance of the City, shall conduct and complete the work of removal in compliance with all such applicable ordinances, and shall restore the streets to the same condition they were in before the work of removal commenced. The work of removal shall be completed not later than one (1) year following the date of expiration of the Franchise.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-115. GENERAL CAPABILITY.
(1) Each Cable Television System shall, at minimum:
    a. Relay to subscriber terminals those broadcast signals required by the FCC;
    b. Distribute in color all television signals which it receives in color;
    c. Make available upon request by any subscribers receiving channels showing premium services and pay per view events, at the expense of the subscriber, a lockout device which prevents the unauthorized viewing of such channels.
    d. All new system extensions shall have a minimum activated capacity of four hundred fifty (450) megahertz.
(2) Because Cable System technology is rapidly changing, it is difficult for the City to set a standard by which the Grantee will upgrade and maintain the Cable Television System in the City. Therefore, insofar as it is technically and economically feasible, Grantee shall upgrade and maintain the System quality equal to or better than the best system that the Grantee provides to any community in Salt Lake County where it has a Franchise.
    a. If the Grantee determines that such an upgrade is not technically or economically feasible, it shall submit to the City full documentation, in detail, setting forth how and why it made such a determination. Such a determination shall use reasonable criteria based on industry standards. At such point in time an upgrade, which was originally found not to be technically or economically feasible, becomes feasible, it shall be implemented as provided herein.
    b. If applicable, Grantee and City shall negotiate a reasonable time table for implementation of any changes in technology as necessitated by this provision.
    c. Implementation of technology which is deemed to be experimental by industry standards can be implemented only at the sole discretion of Grantee.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-116. STANDBY POWER.
Each Cable Television System shall include equipment capable of providing standby powering for headend. The equipment shall be constructed so as to automatically revert to the standby mode when the AC power returns.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-117. OVERRIDE CAPABILITY.
Each Cable Television System shall include an "Emergency Alert Capability" which, when accessed by the telephone and security code, will permit the City, in times of emergency, to override the audio of all channels on the Cable System simultaneously. Each Cable Television System shall include the capability for emergency information and instruction to be given from the City's headquarters for Disaster and Emergency Services. The City shall agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless Grantee from and against any liability resulting from use of the aforementioned emergency override capability. The City agrees to cooperate with other governmental entities regarding the use of the override capabilities in order to prevent two or more governmental entities from using the System at the same time.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-118. INTERCONNECTION.
The Cable Television System shall, insofar as technically and economically feasible, be compatible with and able to be interconnected with other Cable Systems within the City and the greater Salt Lake County area, and other areas adjacent to the Franchise Area so as to enable each system to carry and cablecast the public, educational, and governmental access programming of the other systems.
(Ord. No. 92-18 Repealed & Replaced 05/01/1992)

20-1-119. TECHNICAL STANDARDS.
(1) Grantee shall construct, install and maintain its Cable Television System in a manner consistent and in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, and technical standards equivalent to those established by the FCC.
(2) Grantee shall at all times comply with National Electrical Safety Code (National Bureau of Standards); National Electrical Code (National Bureau of Fire Underwriters); Applicable FCC and other federal, state and local regulations; and codes and other ordinances of the City.
(3) In any event, the Cable Television System shall not endanger or interfere with the safety of persons or property within the City or other areas where the Grantee may have equipment located.

It is the purpose of this Chapter to address the health, safety and welfare concerns surrounding the hazards of a gas transmission pipeline located in the City. These regulations are designed to improve the level of public safety and at the same time safeguard the integrity of the pipeline. A basic assumption is that the main cause of major pipeline failures is due to third party damage to the pipeline during construction and servicing activities. These guidelines are intended to reduce the potential for unauthorized and improper construction activities on the pipeline right-of-way. These provisions do not relieve any person or persons from any obligation under any other regulation imposed by West Valley City Code, state law or federal law, nor do they impose any liability upon the City.

(1) Transmission Pipeline or Pipeline means:
    a. Any pipeline with a nominal diameter of 6" or more, located in the City that is used to transport hazardous liquids. However, it does not include pipelines used to transport hazardous liquids by gravity or pipes used to transport or store hazardous liquids within a refinery, storage or manufacturing facility.
    b. A pipeline operated at a pressure of more than 500 psi that carries natural gas.
(2) Surface Use means the activity or the improvements occurring on the surface of a parcel of land.
(3) Easement means an interest in land owned by another that entitles its holder to a specific limited use or enjoyment.

20-3-104. EXCAVATION PERMIT REQUIRED.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, an excavation permit shall be required before beginning construction or maintenance on any pipeline in the City.

20-5-101. DECLARATION OF FINDING AND INTENT.
(1) Findings Regarding Rights-of-Way. West Valley City finds that the rights-of-way within the City:
    a. Are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of the City;
    b. Are intended for public uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent;
    c. Can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic well-being of the City and its citizens; and
    d. Are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities' construction, placement, relocation, and maintenance in the rights-of-way.
(2) Finding Regarding Compensation. The City finds that the City should receive fair and reasonable compensation for use of the rights-of-way.
(3) Finding Regarding Local Concern. The City finds that while telecommunications systems are in part an extension of interstate commerce, their operations also involve rights-of-way, municipal franchising, and vital business and community service, which are of local concern.
(4) Finding Regarding Promotion of Telecommunications Services. The City finds that it is in the best interests of its taxpayers and citizens to promote the rapid development of telecommunications services, on a nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner that is responsive to community and public interest, and to assure availability for municipal, educational, and community services.
(5) Findings Regarding Franchise Standards. The City finds that it is in the interests of the public to franchise and to establish standards for franchising providers in a manner that:
    a. Fairly and reasonably compensates the City on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis as provided herein;
    b. Encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which providers may use the rights-of-way to serve the public;
    c. Fully protects the public interests and the City from any harm that may flow from such commercial use of rights-of-way;
    d. Protects the police powers and rights-of-way management authority of the City, in a manner consistent with federal and state law;
    e. Otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of the City infrastructure;
    f. Protects the public's investment in improvements in the rights-of-way; and
    g. Ensures that no barriers to entry of telecommunications providers are created and that such franchising is accomplished in a manner that does not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services, within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ("Act") [P.L. No. 96-104].
(6) Power to Manage Rights-of-Way. The City adopts this Telecommunications Ordinance pursuant to its power to manage the rights-of-way, pursuant to common law, the Utah Constitution, and statutory authority, and receive fair and reasonable compensation for the use of rights-of-way by providers as expressly set forth by Section 253 of the Act.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997; Ord. No. 00-51 Amended 09/05/2000)

20-5-102. SCOPE OF ORDINANCE.
This Ordinance shall provide the basic local scheme for providers of telecommunications services and systems that require the use of the rights-of-way, including providers of both the system and service, those providers of the system only, and those providers who do not build the system but who only provide services. This Ordinance shall apply to all future providers and to all providers in the City prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, whether operating with or without a franchise as set forth in Section 20-5-1202.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

(2) Wireless Services. This Ordinance shall not apply to personal wireless service facilities.
(3) Provisions Applicable to Excluded Providers.

(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997; Ord. No. 00-51 Amended 09/05/2000)

(11) "Open Video Service" means any video programming services provided to any person, through the use of rights-of-way, by a provider that is certified by the FCC to operate an open video system pursuant to sections 651, et seq., of the Telecommunications Act (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. Title VI, Part V), regardless of the system used.

(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997; Ord. No. 00-51 Amended 09/05/2000)

20-5-300P PART 3 – FRANCHISE REQUIRED

20-5-301. NON-EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.
The City is empowered and authorized to issue non-exclusive franchises governing the installation, construction, and maintenance of systems in the City's rights-of-way, in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. The franchise is granted through a franchise agreement entered into between the City and provider.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-302. EVERY PROVIDER MUST OBTAIN.
Except to the extent preempted by federal or state law, as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals, every provider must obtain a franchise prior to constructing a telecommunications system or providing telecommunications services using the rights-of-way, and every provider must obtain a franchise before constructing an open video system or providing open video services via an open video system. Any open video system or service shall be subject to the customer service and consumer protection provisions applicable to the cable TV companies to the extent the City is not preempted or permitted as ultimately interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction, including any appeals. The fact that particular telecommunications systems may be used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise, and, should it intend to provide telecommunications services over the same system, must also obtain a telecommunications franchise.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-303. NATURE OF GRANT.
A franchise shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the rights-of-way. A franchise is only the right to occupy rights-of-way on a non-exclusive basis for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the franchise; the right may not be subdivided, assigned, or subleased, except as may be expressly provided in the Franchise Agreement. A franchise does not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating its system on the property of others, including the City’ s property. This section shall not be construed to prohibit a provider from leasing conduit to another provider, so long as the lessee has obtained a franchise.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997; Ord. No. 00-56 Amended 10/17/2000)

20-5-304. CURRENT PROVIDERS.
Except to the extent exempted by federal or state law, any provider acting without a franchise on the effective date of this Ordinance shall request issuance of a franchise from the City within 90 days of the effective date of this Ordinance. If such request is made, the provider may continue providing service during the course of negotiations. If a timely request is not made, or if negotiations cease and a franchise is not granted, the provider shall comply with the provisions of Section 20-5-904.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-305. NATURE OF FRANCHISE.
The franchise granted by the City under the provisions of this Ordinance shall be a non-exclusive franchise providing the right and consent to install, repair, maintain, remove, and replace its system on, over, and under the rights-of-way in order to provide services.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-306. REGULATORY APPROVAL NEEDED.
Before offering or providing any services pursuant to the franchise, a provider shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses for the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state, and local authorities, if required, and shall submit to the City upon the written request of the City evidence of all such approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-307. TERM.
No franchise issued pursuant to this Ordinance shall have a term of less than five years or greater than 15 years. Each franchise shall be granted in a non-discriminatory manner.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-400P PART 4 – COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS

20-5-401. COMPENSATION.
As fair and reasonable compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this Ordinance, a provider shall have the following obligations:
(1) Application Fee. In order to offset the cost to the City to review an application for a franchise and in addition to all other fees, permits, or charges, a provider shall pay to the City, at the time of application, $500 as a non-refundable application fee.
(2) Franchise Fees. The franchise fee, if any, shall be set forth in the franchise agreement. The obligation to pay a franchise fee shall commence on the completion date. The franchise fee is offset by any business license fee or business license tax enacted by the City.
(3) Excavation Permits. The provider shall also pay fees required for an excavation permit as provided in Title 19, Chapter 2, Part 3, West Valley City Code, and Title 1, Chapter 2, West Valley City Code.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-402. TIMING.
Unless otherwise agreed to in the franchise agreement, all franchise fees shall be paid on a monthly basis within 45 days of the close of each calendar month.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-403. FEE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION.
Unless a franchise agreement provides otherwise, each fee payment shall be accompanied by a statement showing the manner in which the fee was calculated and shall be certified as to its accuracy.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-404. FUTURE COSTS.
A provider shall pay to the City or to third parties, at the direction of the City, an amount equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable expenses that the City incurs for the services of third parties (including, but not limited to, attorneys and other consultants) in connection with any renewal or provider-initiated renegotiation, or amendment of this Ordinance or a franchise; provided, however, that the parties shall agree upon a reasonable financial cap at the outset of negotiations. In the event the parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the issue to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-405. TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS.
To the extent taxes or other assessments are imposed by taxing authorities, other than the City, on the use of the City property as a result of a provider's use or occupation of the rights-of-way, the provider shall be responsible for payment of its pro rata share of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise required by the taxing authority. Such payments shall be in addition to any other fees payable pursuant to this Ordinance.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-406. INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENTS.
In the event that any payment is not actually received by the City on or before the applicable date fixed in the franchise, interest thereon shall accrue from such date until received at the rate charged for delinquent state taxes.
(Ord. No. 97-74 Enacted 12/29/1997)

20-5-407. NO ACCORD AND SATISFACTION.

Upon doing so, the City shall submit to such a provider an itemized statement of the cost for repairing and restoring the rights-of-ways intruded upon. The provider shall, within 30 days after receipt of the statement, pay to the City the entire amount thereof.

The owner of property containing impervious surfaces which contribute runoff to the storm water system or who otherwise use or benefit from the Storm Water Utility of the City will be responsible for paying the Storm Water Utility fees as set forth in the Consolidated Fee Schedule. The fee shall be calculated by multiplying the service rate by the parcel’s number of Equivalent Residential Units (ERU’s.) An alternate billing agreement may be entered into which will allow the bill to be sent to an alternate party; however, the property owner retains all obligations for full payment of Storm Water Utility fees.
(Ord. No. 01-05 Enacted 02/06/2001; Ord. No. 01-25 Amended 05/03/2001; Ord. No. 10-32 Amended 10/22/2010; Ord. No. 12-26 Amended 06/28/2012)

20-7-107. SYSTEM OF RATES AND CHARGES.
(1) Service fees imposed. Except as provided below, the City will impose storm sewer drainage fee rates and charges on each parcel of real property within the City except governmentally-owned streets and storm water facilities operated and maintained by, or for the Storm Water Utility, the county or the State of Utah.
(2) Use of funds collected. The charges shall fund the administration, planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of existing and future storm water facilities. Storm Water Utility fees shall also fund water quality improvement programs required by West Valley City’s Utah Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (UPDES) Phase 1 Municipal Storm Water Co-Permit, including: public education and outreach programs, illicit discharge detection and elimination programs, construction site storm water management, post-construction storm water management, and municipal operations to prevent and eliminate storm water pollution.
(3) Methods of determining contribution of storm water. 
    a. Contributions of storm water from non-residential parcels and residential parcels larger than duplexes have been ascertained by determining and measuring impervious surface area using current aerial photography or from approved project plans.
    b. Contributions of storm water from residential parcels have been ascertained by measuring impervious area on randomly selected parcels, to obtain an average impervious area.
(4) Method of determining service fee rates. Storm drainage service fees shall be assessed on each parcel of real property within the City (including City-owned properties), except government-owned streets and utility, state or county storm water facilities. Monthly service fees shall set forth in the Consolidated Fee Schedule and shall be differentiated according to the following classifications:
    a. Rate A. This is the standard rate which shall apply to all parcels which contribute runoff to the storm water system and do not qualify for a lesser rate. Rate A applies to:
        i. Single-family residential parcels. Each parcel shall constitute one Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU).
        ii. Duplex parcels. Each duplex parcel shall be charged two ERU’s per parcel, or one ERU per dwelling unit.
        iii. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) or Condominiums which choose to have individual property owners billed separately, rather than paying for the entire development on one bill.
        iv. Other parcels. Charges for all other parcels shall be computed by multiplying the total ERU’s for a parcel by the monthly rate.
    b. Rate B. 
        i. Properties which Implement Treatment Control Best Management Practices. A reduced rate is available for commercial, industrial, institutional and multi-family developments which implement long term Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce or remove pollutants from storm runoff, before it leaves the development site. Eligible BMPs are listed in the Guidance Document for Storm Water Management, under Commercial and Industrial BMPs for treatment control. To qualify for this rate, the owner or representative of a parcel must:
            A. Obtain BMP approval and secure a Storm Water Management Permit through the West Valley City Engineering Division.
            B. Agree to allow annual inspections of the property to ensure the approved BMP is still in place and properly maintained. If BMPs are not properly maintained, the site will no longer qualify for a reduced rate.
        ii. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) and Condominiums. Rate B applies to Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) and Condominiums with a total impervious surface area less than 1 Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) per unit, provided that the entire PUD development site and/or Condominium development site is billed under one bill.
        iii. Properties which retain the first 0.38 inches of rain runoff (2-year 30 minute storm) for new development projects, and 0.28 inches of rain runoff (2-year 15 minute storm) for re-development projects. Water is to be stored on-site using Low Impact Development techniques. To qualify for this rate, the owner or representative of a parcel must:
            A. Submit plans to the Engineering Division for approval showing drainage calculations to compute runoff volumes, and show how runoff will be permanently stored on-site for infiltration.
    c. Rate C. Some areas of the City are designated as retention or infiltration areas in the Storm Drainage Master Plan. Developments in these areas are designed to discharge no storm water runoff from the site. These properties and properties in other parts of the City, which retain all storm water on site, are beneficiaries of the Storm Water Utility, even though they have no direct storm water discharge. An analysis of the Utility costs has shown that approximately one half of the Utility's costs are fixed program expenditures not directly affected by runoff from individual parcels. The costs of compliance with the City’s UPDES Permit, and maintenance of the City’s street drainage system are examples of fixed costs, which benefit properties not contributing runoff to the Storm Water Utility system. Rate C applies to all properties which retain all storm water runoff. Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) or Condominiums that meet retainage requirements under this Section may be charged Rate “C.”
    d. No Charge. There will be no service charge for undeveloped parcels. Similarly, there will be no charge for sparsely developed parcels which include impervious surface areas which are:
        i. Within a parcel, or combination of parcels with the same ownership, which exceeds 100 acres in size; and
        ii. Distant from the storm drainage system, such that the possibility of a future connection to the system is remote; and
        iii. Isolated from other impervious areas; and
        iv. Adjacent to an undeveloped area of equal size, owned or controlled by the same property owner, capable of absorbing the runoff from the impervious surfaces.

20-7-108. BILLING AND COLLECTION.
(1) Utility Enterprise Fund. This Ordinance creates the Storm Water Utility Fund. All revenues received from storm drainage user fees shall be placed in the enterprise fund as a designated fund, to be left separate and apart from all other City funds. The collection, accounting, and expenditure of all Storm Water Utility funds shall be in accordance with the Utah Uniform Fiscal Procedures Act.
(2) Billing. The City shall bill, or cause to be billed, property owners for storm sewer drainage utility services. Fees and charges shall be considered delinquent if not paid as determined by the procedures established by the City and will be a debt to the City, which shall be subject to recovery in a civil action.
(3) Alternate Billing Agreements and Deposit Requirement. Owners may assign the payment of the storm water utility fee to non-owners by signing an “Alternate Billing Agreement” with the City. The non-owner will be required to place a deposit with the City for $50.00 or the equivalent of TWO months of ERU assessment, whichever is greater. Failure of the non-owner to pay the storm water utility fee shall not relieve the owner from the responsibility of paying the unpaid fees.
    a. Exception. Established non-owners who have had an account with the City for one year or more and the billing account for that particular property has not been in arrears during that one year period will be exempt from the deposit. It shall be the responsibility of the owners or non-owners to notify the City that they qualify for this exception. However, a signed “Alternate Billing Agreement” shall still be required.
(4) Late Fee Imposed. Fees and charges levied in accordance herewith shall be a debt due to the City. Failure to pay within 25 days after the due date (printed on the bill) shall be subject to late fees declared in the Consolidated Fee Schedule and are deemed delinquent. Delinquent accounts are subject to recovery through civil action, including the payment of reasonable legal fees.

20-7-109. APPEAL OF CHARGES.
Any non-residential customer who disagrees with the storm drainage user fee for his or her parcel may apply to the Director for a user fee adjustment. The adjustment request must state the grounds for adjustment and must be filed in writing with the Director no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of billing. The Director shall review the request and basis for user charges to determine whether an error was made in the calculation or application of the fee. The Director may approve an adjustment to the fee.
An appeal of a Director's decision may be brought before the City Manager within thirty (30) days after the date of the Director's decision. Decision of the City Manager shall be final and conclusive.
If an appeal of charges is successful, credit will be applied to all charges from the time of the appealed billing, and will be reflected on a future billing after the appeal is granted.

21-2-101. PURPOSE.
The City Council finds that the distribution of sex paraphernalia can be harmful to minors, both physically and mentally, and in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry of this City, such distribution should be prohibited. Sale of sex paraphernalia to minors does not have to be exclusively regulated by the “Harmful to Minors” or “Indecent Public Display” laws already in effect, since sex paraphernalia, by its definition, is not communicative in nature and, thus, is not protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
(Ord. No. 18-07 § 2 Repealed & Replaced 03/27/2018)

21-2-102. DEFINITIONS.

It does not include any device, appliance or pill designed for birth control or any movie, book, magazine or other communicative material protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
(5) “Display publicly” means the exposing, placing, posting, exhibiting or displaying, in any fashion and in any location, whether public or private, of an item in a manner that it may be readily seen and its content or character distinguished by normal unaided vision viewing it from a public thoroughfare, place or vehicle.
(6) “Promote” means to manufacture, issue, transmit, publish, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit or advertise, or to offer or agree to do the same.
(7) “Sexual device” means any item, device or product, including, but not limited to, dildos, vibrators, artificial vaginas, Spanish fly, ben wa balls, pillows or other products shaped or made to resemble male or female genitals, buttocks, or developed female breasts, edible underwear, flavored or unflavored edible body lotion or other substance designed for internal consumption or any other item, device or product manufactured, promoted or designed to be used primarily for sexual stimulation, sexual arousal or the enhancing or prolonging of sexual activity.
(8) “Knowingly” means to have actual or constructive knowledge of the contents of the subject matter. A person has constructive knowledge if a reasonable inspection under the circumstances would have disclosed the nature of the subject matter or if the failure to inspect is for the purpose of avoiding such disclosure.
(Ord. No. 18-07 § 2 Repealed & Replaced 03/27/2018)

21-2-103. DISTRIBUTION OF SEX PARAPHERNALIA TO MINORS PROHIBITED.
(1) It shall be a class “B” misdemeanor for any person to knowingly distribute or furnish sex paraphernalia to a minor, knowing that such person is a minor, or having failed to exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the proper age of such minor.
(2) It shall be a class “B” misdemeanor for any person to knowingly promote, display publicly, distribute or furnish any sexual device to any minor, knowing that such person is a minor.

23-8-105. DETERMINATION, SEIZURE, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION OF VICIOUS DOGS.
(1) The City Council hereby determines that owning, keeping, or harboring vicious dogs is a nuisance, and that strict controls of vicious dogs are necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of West Valley City.
(2) The Animal Control Division, in the discretion of the Animal Control Administrator or upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a particular dog is a vicious dog, as defined herein, may initiate proceedings to declare such dog a vicious dog. All proceedings to determine whether or not a dog is vicious, or a proceeding on a violation alleged to have been committed by a dog previously determined to be vicious, shall be conducted by an Administrative Code Enforcement Hearing Officer pursuant to the procedures of Title 10 of the City Code, in addition to the procedures set forth in this section. In determining whether or not a dog shall be declared a vicious dog, the Hearing Officer may consider, as a mitigating factor, that the actions of the dog were provoked, as defined in this chapter. A hearing on the matter shall be conducted if requested in writing. The person owning, keeping, sheltering, or harboring the dog in question shall be given written notice of the time and place of the hearing, pursuant to Section 10-2-504 of the City Code. Said notice shall set forth the description of the dog in question and the basis for the allegation of viciousness. The notice shall also set forth that if the dog is determined to be vicious, the owner will be required to register and restrain it in accordance with this chapter, remove it from the City, or allow it to be destroyed. The notice shall state that if the owner or keeper of the dog fails to request a hearing in writing, a default order will be entered deeming the dog vicious. The notice shall be served upon any adult residing at the premises where the dog is located, or may be posted on those premises if no adult is present to accept service.
(3) If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines that a dog is vicious, as defined in this chapter, the Hearing Officer shall order the person owning, sheltering, harboring, or keeping the dog to register the dog in compliance with this chapter; to remove it from the City; or to cause it to be destroyed in a humane manner. The order shall immediately be served upon the individual or entity against whom issued in the same manner as the notice of hearing. If the order is not complied with within three days of its issuance, the Animal Control Division is authorized to order the seizure and impoundment of the dog. A dog so seized shall be impounded for a period of ten days from the date the order is served upon the owner or keeper. If, at the end of the impoundment period, the person against whom the order was issued has not appealed such order to the District Court, the Animal Control Division shall cause the dog to be destroyed.
(4) The order issued by the Hearing Officer, declaring a dog vicious, or in violation of this chapter, and ordering the owner or keeper to register, remove, or destroy the dog, may be appealed to the District Court. In order to appeal the order, written notice of appeal must be filed with the Court within ten days after receipt of the order to remove, register, or destroy the vicious dog. Failure to file such written notice of appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal the order of the Hearing Officer. The order issued by the Hearing Officer shall state the appeal process established by this section.
    a. The District Court shall review the record of the Hearing Officer's decision or the allegations that led to the default order, and shall uphold the decision unless it was arbitrary, capricious, or illegal.
    b. If the appeal is from an order finding that a dog previously determined to be vicious is in violation of this chapter, then the Court shall review the order concerning the violation only, and not review the prior determination that the dog is vicious.
    c. While the appeal is pending, the dog shall be confined in a manner consistent with the requirements of this chapter, as approved by the Animal Control Administrator, and at the sole expense of the owner or keeper.
(5) If the District Court upholds the decision of the Hearing Officer, the owner or keeper of the vicious dog shall comply with the Hearing Officer's order within three days of receiving notice of the Court's decision. If the order is not complied with, the Animal Control Division is authorized to seize and impound the vicious dog, at the owner's or keeper's expense. The dog will be impounded for seven days, during which the owner or keeper may redeem the animal by paying all reasonable costs associated with the impoundment, and by showing, to the satisfaction of the Animal Control Administrator, that the owner or keeper will fully comply with the order of the Hearing Officer.
(6) Failure to comply with an order of the Hearing Officer issued pursuant hereto and not appealed, or upheld by the District Court after appeal, shall constitute a Class B misdemeanor.
(7) Any dog found at large which displays vicious tendencies may be processed as a vicious dog pursuant to the foregoing.
(8) All costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the owner if the dog is determined to be vicious. If collection of expenses is pursued, the City shall file suit and receive a judgment for all expenses, together with reasonable attorneys' fees, interest, and court costs. If the dog is not determined to be vicious, all costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be paid by the City.

25-1-102     Statement of Purpose.
25-1-103     Methods of Reducing Flood Losses.

25-1-101. FINDINGS OF FACT.
(1) The flood hazard areas of West Valley City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2) These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(Ord. No. 09-30 Amended 10/10/2009)

25-1-102. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
(7) Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. No. 09-30 Amended 10/10/2009)

25-1-103. METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance uses the following methods:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

    a. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions or
    b. Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
(39) VARIANCE - is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this ordinance when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations.).
(40) VIOLATION - means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(41) WATER SURFACE ELEVATION - means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or riverine areas.

(2) The Appeal Board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Flood plain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance.
(3) Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
(4) The Flood plain Administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(5) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this ordinance.
(6) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 25-4-103(2) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(7) Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this ordinance (Section 25-1-102).
(8) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(9) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(10) Prerequisites for granting variances:
    a. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
    b. Variances shall only be issued upon:
        i. showing a good and sufficient cause;
        ii. a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
        iii. a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
    c. Any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(11) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
    a. the criteria outlined in Section 25-4-104 (1)-(9) are met, and
    b. the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

(7) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
(Ord. No. 09-30 Enacted 10/10/2009)

25-5-102. SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 25-3-102; Section 25-4-102(8); or Section 25-5-103(3). The following provisions are required:
(1) Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Flood plain Administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Section 25-4-103(1), is satisfied.
(2) Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood-proofed shall be maintained by the Flood plain Administrator.
(3) Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
    a. A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.
    b. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
    c. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(4) Manufactured Homes. 
    a. Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
    b. Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to a minimum of one foot the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
    c. Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this section be elevated so that either:
        i. the lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation, or
        ii. the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
(5) Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:
    a. be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
    b. be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
    c. meet the permit requirements of Section 25-4-103(1), and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in paragraph (4) of this section. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
(Ord. No. 09-30 Enacted 10/10/2009)

25-5-103. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
(1) All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall be consistent with Chapter 25-1 of this ordinance.
(2) All proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet Development Permit requirements of Section 25-3-103, Section 25-4-103, and the provisions of Chapter 25-5 of this ordinance.
(3) Base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions which is greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is lesser, if not otherwise provided pursuant to Section 25-3-102 or Section 25-4-102(8) of this ordinance.
(4) All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(5) All subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(Ord. No. 09-30 Enacted 10/10/2009)

25-5-104. STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 25-3-102, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures;
    a. have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified), or;
    b. together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.
(3) A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the Flood plain Administrator that the standards of this Section, as proposed in Section 25-4-103(1), are satisfied.
(4) Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
(Ord. No. 09-30 Enacted 10/10/2009)

25-5-105. FLOODWAYS.
Floodways - located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 25-3-102, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) If Section 25-5-105(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Chapter 25-5.
(3) Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

26-1-105     Severability.
26-1-106     Definitions.

26-1-101. PURPOSE.
(1) Every individual in the City has the right to work and earn wages through gainful employment. Discriminatory employment practices are detrimental because they impede the social and economic progress of the City by preventing all of the City’s citizens from contributing to or fully participating in the cultural, spiritual, social and commercial life of the community, which is essential to the growth and vitality of the City’s neighborhoods and businesses. The Utah Antidiscrimination Act, Utah Code Section 34A-5-101 et seq., addresses employment related discrimination based on race; color; sex; pregnancy; childbirth, or pregnancy-related conditions; religion; national origin; age (if 40 years of age or older); and disability, but does not address discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
(2) Every individual in the City has the right to seek housing. Discriminatory housing practices are detrimental because they impede the social and economic progress of the City by preventing all of the City’s citizens from contributing to or fully participating in the cultural, spiritual, social and commercial life of the community, which is essential to the growth and vitality of the City’s neighborhoods and businesses.
(3) The Utah Fair Housing Act, Utah Code Section, 57-21-1 et seq., addresses housing related discrimination based on race; color; religion; sex; national origin; familial status; source of income; and disability, but does not address discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
(4) The City has found that discrimination in employment and housing on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity must be addressed. The denial or deprivation of employment rights and access to housing because of an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the City’s citizens and damages the City’s economic well-being. The purpose of this Title is to provide a clear and comprehensive mandate for the prevention and elimination of discrimination in employment and housing in the City against individuals based upon sexual orientation or gender identity and this Title shall be liberally construed to achieve that purpose.
(Ord. No. 10-16 Enacted 06/11/2010)

26-1-102. ADMINISTRATION.
The City Manager is responsible for administering and implementing this chapter.
(Ord. No. 10-16 Enacted 06/11/2010)

26-1-103. ANTI-DISCRIMINATION BOARD.
(1) The City Manager is authorized to establish the Anti-Discrimination Board and to appoint the three members of the Board.
(2) The term of each Board member shall be determined by the City Manager.
(3) Any member of the Board may be removed by the City Manager at any time. The City Manager shall select the chair of the Board.
(4) The Board may adopt rules of policy and procedure for the governing of meetings, its members, and the performance of its duties.
(Ord. No. 10-16 Enacted 06/11/2010)

26-1-104. NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION; NO SPECIAL RIGHTS.
This Title does not create a private cause of action, nor does it create any right or remedy that is the same or substantially equivalent to the remedies provided under federal or state law. This Title does not create any special rights or privileges which would not be available to all of the City’s citizens because every person has a sexual orientation and a gender identity.
(Ord. No. 10-16 Enacted 06/11/2010)

26-1-105. SEVERABILITY.
If any section, sentence, paragraph, term, definition or provision of this Title is for any reason determined to be illegal, invalid, superseded by other authority or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction or by any state or federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction thereof, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such determination shall have no effect on the validity of any other section, sentence, paragraph, term, definition or provision of this chapter, all of which will remain in full force and effect.

Ordinance Table
This table lists all codified ordinances. If an ordinance is codified, its location in the code is cited by chapter number at the end of the ordinance description. Ordinances are codified if they are general, permanent, and/or include penalty provisions for noncompliance. “Not codified” indicates that the ordinance could have been codified but was not for some reason (e.g., superseded by a later ordinance, codified in a separate publication). “Special” means the ordinance was special in nature or for a specific period of time (e.g., budget, annexation, tax levy).
