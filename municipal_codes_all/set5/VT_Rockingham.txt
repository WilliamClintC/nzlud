customer. Where a customer has or proposes to install an apparatus which requires
water in sudden and material quantities, impairing the pressure to the detriment,
damage, or disadvantage of other customers, the utility reserves the right to require
such customer to install devices or an apparatus which will confine such fluctuation
of demand and pressure within reasonable limits determined by the utility.

ARTICLE III USE OF THE PUBLIC SEWERS
Section 1.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, ground
water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted
industrial process waters into any sanitary sewer.
Section 2.
Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are
specifically designated as combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved
by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be
discharged, on approval of the Superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural
outlet.
Section 3.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or
wastes to any public sewers:
(a) Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid
or gas.
(b) Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in
sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, to injure or
interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals,
create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage
treatment plant.
Page 5 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
(c) Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.0*, or having any other corrosive
property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel
of the sewage works.
*This may be reviewed on a case by case basis and a more restrictive limit may be
established.
(d) Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction
to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the sewage
works such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal,

manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc. either
whole or ground by garbage grinders.
Section 4.
No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances,
materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the Superintendent that such
wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse
effect on the receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or
constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature
of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability
of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances
prohibited are:

objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive chlorine
requirement, to such degree that any such material received in the composite sewage
at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the Superintendent for
such material.
Page 6 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
(f) Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances,

(i) Materials which exert or cause
(1) Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to,
Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as,
but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).
(2) Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions).
(3) Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such
quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works,
may cause the effluent limitations of the discharge permit to be exceeded.
(4) Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting "slugs" as
defined herein.
(j) Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment
or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are amenable to
treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot
meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to
the receiving waters.
Section 5.
If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers,
which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in Section 4 of
this Article, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent, may have a deleterious effect
upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create
a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may:
(a) reject the wastes,
(b) require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers,
Page 7 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
(c) require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
if the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Superintendent, and subject to the requirements of all applicable
codes, ordinances, laws and the municipal discharge permit. Further, such
pretreatment installations must be consistent with the requirements of any state
pretreatment permit issued to the industry.
Section 6.

in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All
interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspections.
Section 7.
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or
wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense.
Section 8.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such
necessary meters, and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly
and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
All industries discharging into a public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their
discharges as the Superintendent may reasonably require, including installation, use, and
maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting the results of such
monitoring to the Superintendent. Where industrial pretreatment permits are issued by the
State of Vermont, monitoring records must also be submitted to the Secretary in accordance
with such permit. Such records of any monitoring shall be made available by the
Superintendent, upon request, to the Secretary or to other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharges to the receiving waters.
Section 9.
All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which
reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition
of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the
American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the
Page 8 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
effect on constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determined whether a twentyfour
(24) hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken.) Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from
periodic grab samples.
Section 10.
Any industry held in violation of the provisions of this ordinance may have its disposal
authorization terminated.
Section 11.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement
or arrangement between the Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste
of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
payment, therefore, by the industrial concern provided that such agreements do not
contravene any requirements of existing federal laws and are compatible with any user charge
and Industrial Costs Recovery System in effect.
Section 12.
Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy
vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage
within the limits of the Bellows Falls Village Corporation boundaries.
Section 13.
The owner of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment,
recreation, or other purposes, situated within the Bellows Falls Village Corporation and
abutting on any street, alley or right-of-way in which there is not located or may in the future

Section 35.935-13 and 24 VSA, Chapter 101.
Section 3.
User Charge System.
A. Basic User Charges.
All current operating and maintenance costs of the sewage works and sewer
department shall be paid by the users of the system. User charges shall be determined
using the following formulas:
Page 11 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
1) Residential and commercial users of the municipal water system.
Annual Maintenance,
Unit Cost (per 100 Administration and
cu.ft.) of Metered = Operation Costs x .95 (MW) + E (.95MW)
Water TP cu.ft./100 MW
2) Industrial users with metered waste water.
Unit Cost (per 100 Maintenance,
cu.ft.) of metered Administration and
Industrial Waste Water = Operation Expenses x IW + E (IW)
TP cu.ft. 100 IW
Where:
E = TP - (.95 MW + IW) .95 MW + IW
TP = Total annual volume (cu. ft.) of waste water from all sources which
pass through the sewage works.
MW = Annual volume of metered water tributary to the sewage works. Except
in instances where a substantial volume of water is consumed by the
user without discharge through the sewer system. This figure will
include all water supplied by the Village water system.
IW = Annual volume of industrial wastewater metered at the point of
discharge into the sewer system
.
3) Other Users.
Users of the sewage works who do not obtain water through the municipal
water system of the Village and do not have metered waste water shall pay an
estimated rate to be determined by the Trustees. If the Trustees find that the
estimated rate is inequitable under the circumstances for a specific user, then a
meter may be required to determine actual usage, or the Trustees may make
such other adjustments or arrangements with the user as shall be appropriate
under the circumstances. (Amended 6/22/1987 – Book 1, Page 222)
4) Special Circumstances.
If application of the above formulas to a specific user is manifestly
unreasonable and is, to a substantial degree, inconsistent with the actual use of
the sewage works by that user, then the Trustees may adjust said user's annual
charges accordingly.
Page 12 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
B. Additional User Charges.
In addition to the basic user charges, the Trustees may add such surcharges to the unit
cost of metered water or wastewater as shall be necessary or appropriate to provide for
capital improvements and major repairs to the sewage works and all appurtenances
thereof. Surcharges levied under this section may be used and applied to pay interest
and principal of sewage disposal bonds of the Village and for such other purposes
authorized by Title 24 VSA, Section 3613 - 3616 as the Trustees shall approve. Users
who discharge pollutants which increase the cost of managing the effluent or sludge
from the treatment works must pay for those increased costs. (Amended 6/22/1987 –
Book 1, Page 222)
Section 4.
Industrial Cost Recovery Structure (to be developed when needed).
Section 5.
Annually, each user shall be notified of his user charge rate and of that portion of the user
charges attributable to maintenance, administrative and operational costs (Added 6/22/1987 –
Book 1, Page 223)
Section 6.
The Trustees shall maintain a financial management system which accounts for revenues and
expenditures for maintenance, administration and operation of the sewage works and sewer
department. These revenues and expenditures shall be accounted for separately from other
Village funds (Added 6/22/1987 – Book 1, Page 223)
ARTICLE IX PRIVATE (RURAL) SEWAGE DISPOSAL
Section l.
Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under the provisions of Article
III, Section 13, the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal system
complying with the provisions of "Regulations Governing Individual Wastewater Disposal
Systems Within the Town of Rockingham" adopted by the Board of Selectmen November 3,
1971.
Section 2.
Before commencement of the construction of a private sewage disposal system, the owner
shall first obtain a written permit signed by the Town Health Officer which the applicant shall
supplement by any plans, specifications, and other information deemed necessary by the
Town Health Officer. A permit and inspection fee as stipulated in the regulations shall be
paid to the Town Health Officer at the time the application is filed.
Section 3.
At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage
disposal system, as provided in Article IX, Section 4, a direct connection shall be made to the
public sewer, in compliance with this ordinance, and any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar
private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable material.
Page 13 of 14
Chapter VIII – Sewer Use Rules and Regulations
Section 4.
The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary
manner at all times, at no expense to the Village.
Section 5.
No statement contained in this article shall be construed to interfere with any additional
requirements that may be imposed by the Health Officer.
Section 6.
When a public sewer becomes available, the building sewer shall be connected to said sewer
within sixty (60) days, and the private sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of sludge and
filled with clean, bank-run gravel or dirt.

ARTICLE I ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURE
1100 ENACTMENT AND PURPOSE
1110 ENACTMENT
In accordance with Section 4401 of the Vermont Planning and Development Act, Chapter 117, Title
24 V.S.A. (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”), there is hereby established a Zoning Bylaw for the

as the “Town of Rockingham Zoning Regulation” (hereinafter referred to as “this Regulation”).
1120 PURPOSE
It is the intent of this Regulation to provide for orderly community growth and to further the
purposes established in Section 4302 of the Act.
1200 APPLICATION OF BYLAW
The application of this Regulation is subject to the provisions of Sections 4411, 4412, 4413, 4414,

This Regulation repeals and replaces the previous Zoning Regulations for the Town of Rockingham
dated September 7, 1972, and the previous Zoning Ordinance for the Village of Bellows Falls date
1973, but is not intended to repeal, annul, or in any way impair any other regulations or permits
previously adopted or issued. Where the provisions of this Regulation impose a greater restriction
upon the use of a structure or land than is required by any other statute, ordinance, rule or
regulation, the provisions of this Regulation shall control.
1220 CONFLICTING OR OVERLAPPING PROVISIONS
In any case where the provisions of the Regulations overlap or conflict in their application to a
particular structure, use or parcel of land, those provisions which would impose the greater
restriction upon such structure, use or parcel of land shall control.
1300 ADMINISTRATION
1310 ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER
Page 7
An Administrative Officer shall be appointed in accordance with Section 4448 of the Act, who shall
then literally enforce the provisions of this Regulation and perform such other duties as specified in

Officer shall state the reasons for such decision [Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28, 2007]
1320 ZONING PERMITS

more parcels, construction, reconstruction, structural alteration, relocation or enlargement of any
building, mining, excavation or landfill required for construction, and any change in the use of a
building, structure or land, or extension of use of land may be commenced, nor shall any land or
structure be used or in any way extended in the Town of Rockingham until a Zoning Permit or
Certificate of Compliance for the division of land has been issued therefore. [Amended section generally
April 28, 1986, Effective May 19, 1986.]

No Zoning Permit shall take effect until fifteen (15) days have passed from date of issuance or, if an
appeal is filed, not until the final adjudication of that appeal.
1324 EXPIRATION
A Zoning Permit shall become void if the work described therein has not been commenced within
two years from date of issuance.
1325 CONNECTION TO WASTEWATER FACILITIES
Page 8
Construction of a dwelling or any building to be occupied shall not begin until a Municipal sewer
connection permit, or an On-site Sewage Disposal permit is approved by the State of Vermont.
[Amended July 7, 1998, Effective July 28, 1998, added new section.]
1326 WAIVERS
As allowed under 24. V.S.A. 4414(8), in all zoning districts, a waiver of dimensional setbacks (front,
rear and side yard requirements) from property lines may be granted subject to the following.
Dimensional setbacks are limited to distances which structures are required to be located from
property lines and street lines. Waivers do not apply to height or density requirements or
requirements set forth in the Rockingham Flood Hazard Area Zoning Bylaw.
Any waiver granted under this section shall be limited to the specific property to which it has been
granted. A waiver on one property shall not be construed as a general guideline or standard for any
other property.
A. Waivers for handicap accessibility. Handicapped access ramps or other handicapped
accessibility structures which provide access for residential units are exempt from the setback
requirements set forth in this bylaw. Waivers may be granted for such by the administrative
officer. Any ramp for which a waiver is issued, and which does not meet setback requirements
shall be in place for only as long as necessary to accommodate the individual(s) with a disability.
Ramp construction shall not encroach on any public rights-of-way without approval of the
Selectboard or State.
B. Waivers for other than handicap accessibility. Waivers may be granted by the Development
Review Board for residential structures or historic buildings upon positive findings by the
Development Review Board under (3) below.
1. Waivers for residential structures.
a. Waivers may be granted for residential structures including residential accessory
structures.
The residential use must be a permitted use within the district in which it is located.
Mixed residential and commercial structures do not qualify for a waiver. A home
occupation or home business does not constitute a mixed use.
b. Waivers of dimensional setbacks are limited to the following:
1. Reduction in any required front, side or rear yard setback
a. To allow for necessary life safety improvements.
b. To allow for construction of energy conservation and renewable energy
structures which cannot be reasonably developed without a waiver.
2. A reduction in the front setback to those found on adjacent properties or property:
a. Within the Residential 7 and Saxtons River districts.
b. For properties along Lower Bartonsville Road meeting the following
requirements:
Page 9
(i) The property abuts Lower Bartonsville Road, and
(ii) The property has a Lower Bartonsville Road locatable E911 address
beginning with #46 and up to and including #252.
c. For property along Saxtons River Road meeting the following requirements:
(i) The property abuts Saxtons River Road, and
(ii) The property has a Saxtons River Road locatable E911 address beginning
with #940 and up to and including #999.
2. Waivers for historic buildings.
a. Waivers may be granted for historic buildings upon positive findings by the
Development Review Board under (3) below.
Historic buildings are those contributing properties listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, the Vermont State Register of Historic Places, located within the
Meeting House Historic [zoning] District, or listed in the Rockingham Town Plan, Chapter
8, Historic Resources, and Inventory of historic sites.
b. Waivers of dimensional setbacks for historic buildings are limited to the following
development: small additions, accessory buildings, porches, dormers, changes to the
roofline, disability access, life safety improvements, energy conservation and renewable
energy structures.
3. Review Criteria.
The Development Review Board may issue a waiver upon finding that
a. The granting of the waiver will not result in an unsafe condition on the lot or to the
public.
b. The design used incorporates design techniques (restricted height, lack of windows),
screening (fencing or plantings) or other remedies to reasonably limit impact or the
potential for impact upon the neighbors or public rights-of-way.
c. The waiver requested accommodates structures providing for disability access, fire-life
safety and other requirements of land or energy conservation or renewable energy
structures.
d. The waiver requested would not impair sight distances on or maintenance of public or
private roads or sidewalks.
e. The waiver requested would not infringe on potential solar gain or vistas of abutting
properties.
f. The proposed work or construction does not encroach into the required front, side or
rear yard setbacks any more than necessary to accomplish the desired results.
g. The proposed development is compatible in scale and design of structures and the
overall existing development pattern of the surrounding area.
h. The proposed development does not reduce landscape area any more than necessary to
accomplish the desired results;
i. The waiver resolves a practical difficulty in developing the property, allows reasonable
use of the property and avoids an undue hardship;
Page 10
j. In the case of historic properties, the waiver is essential to the preservation and
renovation of the historic building or the preservation of the historic pattern of land use
of the surrounding area.
4. Decision & Conditions
The Development Review Board shall make its decision on the request for waiver by
applying the facts presented in the application and at waiver review to the criteria listed
herein. Upon the close of the waiver review, the Development Review Board shall issue its
decision in writing within 45 days.
In approving a waiver, the Development Review Board shall determine and may impose
conditions to ensure that the waiver is the minimum to afford relief and represents the least
deviation possible from the dimensional requirements. These conditions may include, but
need not be limited to, the following:
a. Limiting the size of the structure;
b. Requiring the mitigation of impacts to adjoining properties and/or uses, to public rightsof-
way through building design (e.g. limiting window placement), layout, landscaping or
screening;
c. Reducing the encroachment into the required front, side or rear yard setbacks;
d. Requiring that the project does not extend beyond an existing nonconforming structure
unless needed to accomplish the intended goal;
e. Reducing the waiver requested to ensure that the waiver represents the minimum
waiver that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the
Zoning Bylaw;
f. Controlling the location and number of vehicular access points;
g. Requiring the application to have professional site plans prepared by a surveyor,
engineer, architect or landscape architect licensed by the State of Vermont.
5. Appeal. A decision of the Development Review Board regarding a waiver may be taken to
the environmental court as provided for in 24 V.S.A. §4471.
C. Application. An application for a waiver must include a completed Zoning Application form.
The application shall be submitted to the Administrative Officer at least 15 days prior to the
meeting of the Development Review Board.
Application for conformance with life safety or other state or federal code requirement shall
include a letter from the regulatory agency indicating the requirement which must be met
including information as to required and alternative locations. Application for a historic building
waiver shall include the name of the listing document and information on the property as
contained therein. [Amended adding new section. Adopted October 18, 2011; Effective November. 9, 2011.]
1327 INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL REVIEWS
Page 11
In accordance with Section 4440 of the Act, the Development Review Board may impose reasonable
fees, in addition to application fees, to cover independent technical review(s) of an application,
including but not limited to engineering review, legal review of any associated legal documentation,
design review and/or to conduct inspections to ensure compliance with approved plans.
A. In the event the Development Review Board believes they require independent technical review
for the diligent, application specific pursuit of their work, they shall so determine by majority
vote of the Board. That vote shall occur during the public review or hearing for that application.
B. In the event that the Development Review Board directs a technical review to take place, the
Town shall obtain an estimate of the review costs. The applicant and/or owner shall be
responsible for paying the estimated costs of the review to the Town. The technical review will
not take place until the Town receives the funds. In the event that the review ends up costing
less than the estimate, the Town shall reimburse the applicant and/or owner. Should the
review be more than the estimated cost, the applicant and/or owner shall be required to pay
the additional costs.
C. The Development Review Board may table review of the application pending receipt of an
independent technical review. An application for a zoning permit or approval by the
Development Review Board will not be considered complete and therefore approvals will not be
issued until such time as all costs for the technical review are paid in full. No decision by the
Development Review Board or Administrative Officer may be issued until the review costs are
paid in full.
D. In the event of failure to pay a balance due the Development Review Board may deem the
application incomplete and deny the application. The application may be re-submitted without
changes within 6 months of the denial upon receipt of the balance due. If resubmitted, time
frames for review and approval will start anew from the date of receipt of the balance and all
application fees shall be paid.
E. In the event that an applicant and/or owner disagrees with the determination of the
Development Review Board that a technical review is warranted, the Development Review
Board may render the application incomplete and deny the application. [Amended adding new section.
Adopted October 18, 2011; Effective November. 9, 2011.]
1335 TEMPORARY USES AND STRUCTURES
The following zoning permits may be issued by the Administrative Officer for a period not to exceed
six (6) months out of twelve (12) months, conditioned upon agreement by the owner to remove the
structure or use upon expiration of the permit for:
A. Nonconforming uses or structures incidental to a construction project;
B. Temporary roadside stand within C-I AF, RR1, and RR5 districts, for the sale of agricultural
products only. Site plan approval under Section 2310 shall be required. [Amended April 28, 1986,
Effective May 19, 1986]
Page 12
1340 ENFORCEMENT, PENALTIES AND REMEDIES
In accordance with Sections 4451, 4452, and 4454 of the Act, the following provisions shall apply:
A. Any person who violates any bylaw after it has been adopted under this chapter or who violates
a comparable ordinance or regulation adopted under prior enabling laws shall be fined not
more than one hundred dollars for each offense. No action may be brought under this section
unless the alleged offender has had at least seven days’ notice by certified mail that a violation
exists. In default of payment of the fine, such person, the members of any partnership, or the
principal officers of such corporation shall each pay double the amount of such fine. Each day
that a violation is continued shall constitute a separate offense. All fines collected for the
violation of bylaws shall be paid over to the municipality whose bylaw has been violated.
B. Any person who, being the owner or agent of the owner of any lot, tract or parcel of land, lays
out, constructs, opens or dedicates any street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main or
other improvements for public use, travel or other purposes or for the common use of
occupants of buildings abutting thereon, or sells, transfers or agrees or enters into an
agreement to sell any land in a subdivision or land development whether by reference to or by
other use of a plat of such subdivision or land development or otherwise, or erects any
structure thereon, unless a final plat has been prepared in full compliance with this chapter and
the bylaws adopted under this chapter and has been recorded as provided herein, shall be fined
not more than one hundred dollars and each lot or parcel so transferred or sold or agreed or
included in a contract to be sold shall be deemed a separate violation. All fines collected for
such violations shall be paid over to the municipality whose regulation has been violated. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the
process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or
from the remedies herein provided.
C. If any street, building, structure, or land is or proposed to be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, converted, maintained or used in violation of any bylaw adopted under
this chapter the administrative officer shall institute in the name of the municipality any
appropriate action, injunction or other proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such
construction or use, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act conduct, business or use
constituting a violation. [Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28, 2007]
1350 APPEALS
An interested person, as defined in Section 4465(b) of the Act, may appeal any act or decision of the
Administrative Officer to the Development Review Board within fifteen (15) days of such act or
decision, according to the provisions of Subchapter 11 of the Act. [Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August

1610 DUTIES
The Development Review Board shall have all of the powers and duties specified in the Act,
including the following:
1611 APPEALS
To hear and decide upon appeals brought by interested persons according to the provisions of
Section 1350 of this Regulation.
1612 VARIANCES
A. On an appeal under Section 4469 of the Act wherein a variance from the provisions of a Zoning
Regulation is requested for a structure that is not primarily a renewable energy resource
structure, the Development Review Board may grant variances, and render a decision in favor of
the appellant, if all the following facts are found and the finding is specified in its decision.
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions,
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions, of the Zoning
Regulation in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Regulation
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use
of the property;
3. That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
4. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, not
be detrimental to the public welfare; and
5. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least deviation possible from the Zoning Regulation and from the
Town Plan.
B. On an appeal under Section 4469 of the Act wherein a variance from the provisions of a Zoning
Regulation is requested for a structure that is primarily a renewable energy resource structure,
Page 14
the Development Review Board may grant such variances and render a decision in favor of the
appellant if all the following facts are found and the finding is specified in its decision.
C. It is unusually difficult or unduly expensive for the appellant to build a suitable renewable
energy resource structure in conformance with the regulations; and
D. That the hardship was not created by the appellant; and
E. That the variance, if authorized will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, reduce access to renewable energy resources, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare; and
F. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and
will represent the least deviation possible from the Zoning Regulation and from the Town Plan.
G. In rendering a decision in favor of an appellant under this section, the Development Review
Board may attach such conditions to variances as it may consider necessary and appropriate
under the circumstances to implement the purposes of V.S.A., Chapter 117, and the Town Plan.

notice and public hearing that the proposed use will conform to general and specific standards as
prescribed in the Zoning Bylaw.
A. The Development Review Board shall act to approve or disapprove any such conditional use
within forty-five (45) days after the date of the final public hearing held under this bylaw, and
failure to so act within such period shall be deemed approval.
B. General Standards. Such general standards shall require that the proposed conditional use shall
not result in an undue adverse effect on any of the following:
1. The capacity of existing or planned community facilities;
a. The Development Review Board shall consider the demand for community services and
facilities resulting from the proposed development in relation to the available or
planned capacity of such services and facilities;
b. Available capacity may be determined in part through consultation with other municipal
and/or state officials having jurisdiction over affected services and facilities;
c. Conditions may be imposed as appropriate to ensure that the demand for community
facilities or services does not exceed existing or anticipated available capacity and to
mitigate the impact of the proposed development;
d. Mitigation measures shall be employed by the applicant as necessary to avoid undue
adverse effects to such facilities. Examples of mitigation measures to avoid undue
adverse impacts may include, but are not limited to, phasing of development,
installation of facilities to serve the proposed development, and/or submission of a
bond or other surety, as approved by the Selectboard, for the installation of such
facilities or improvements.
2. The character of the area affected as defined by the purpose or purposes of the zoning
district within which the project is located, and specifically stated policies and standards of
the municipal plan;
a. The Development Review Board shall consider the location, scale, type, density and
intensity of use associated with the proposed development in relation to the character
of the area likely to be affected;
b. Conditions may be imposed as appropriate to ensure project compatibility with the
character of the area affected and to mitigate the impact of the proposed development;
c. Mitigation measures shall be employed by the applicant as necessary to avoid undue
adverse effects on the character of the area. Examples of mitigation measures to avoid
undue adverse impacts may include, but are not limited to, site plan modifications,
increased setbacks, buffers or screening, and/or limiting hours of operation.
3. Traffic on the roads and highways in the vicinity;
Page 16
a. The Development Review Board shall consider the projected impact of traffic resulting
from the proposed development on the capacity, safety, efficiency, and use of affected
public roads;
b. Conditions may be imposed as appropriate to ensure that the condition, capacity, safety
and function of roads and associated infrastructure are adequately maintained over the
long-term and to mitigate the impact of the proposed development;
c. Mitigation measures shall be employed by the applicant as necessary to avoid undue
adverse effects on the road and highways. Examples of mitigation measures to avoid
undue adverse impacts may include, but are not limited to, phasing of the development,
traffic management strategies, physical improvements to the road network to serve the
proposed development paid for and installed by the applicant, and/or submission of a
bond or other surety, as approved by the Selectboard, for the installation of such
improvements;
d. A traffic impact study may be required, particularly for uses which propose direct access
onto U.S. Rte. 5, Rte. 103, Rte. 121 or which generate in excess of 100 trips per day.
4. Bylaws and ordinances then in effect;
5. Utilization of renewable energy resources.
C. Specific Standards. Such specific standards shall require that the proposed conditional use shall

2410 TOWN OF ROCKINGHAM
2411 RURAL RESIDENTIAL (RR-1)
Purpose. The RR1 zoning district encompasses the largest area of the town. Much of this area was
originally farm land. The farms augmented income with logging, maple syrup production, and other
farm related activity. Rural areas continue to host a variety of uses some of which are a
continuation of the old farm and New England tradition of mixed uses in the rural areas. The
limited commercial uses, such as retail store, are more likely along major roads while other uses
such as a reservoir may be on more lightly travelled roadways. The 1-2 acre lot size means that
uses may be in close proximity. Some areas have homes very near to each other on small lots such
as Edgebrook Park, Rte. 121, Cambridgeport, and Upper and Lower Bartonsville.
The Rural Residential 1 District allows for moderate density development in a rural setting.

2412 RURAL RESIDENTIAL (RR-5)
Purpose. The RR5 zoning district encompasses area in the northern portion of the town and a small
area in the southwest portion. Much of this area was originally farm land. The farms augmented
income with logging, maple syrup production, and other farm related activity. Rural areas continue
to host a variety of uses some of which are a continuation of the old farm and New England
tradition of mixed uses in the rural areas. The RR5 areas are not located along main highways and
the limited nonresidential uses would also be accessed via secondary roadways. The Parker Hill
area was one of the early settlement areas of the community and still retains some historic
homesteads set among farm fields and separated by woodland. The Atcherson Hollow area’s
historic homes are mostly lost to history, but more recent development has retained open fields
and woods between newer residences.
The Rural Residential 5 District allows for low density development in a rural setting.

2413 RECREATION CONSERVATION (RC)
Purpose. There are five areas within Rockingham designated as Recreation-Conservation areas.
These include the Dorand State Forest, the Bellows Falls Country Club, the so-called “Setback” area
north of Bellows Falls Village, Herrick’s Cove and the Upper Meadows surrounding Roundy Cove.
The latter three are impacted by floodplain areas and are immediate adjacent to the Connecticut
River. The Herrick’s Cove area has been named an Important Birding Area by the Audubon Society.
The Herrick’s Cove, Upper Meadows and Roundy Cove areas are also within the Natural Resources
Overlay District. The Country Club land descends to the Williams River while the Dorand State
Forest is located in an area of Rockingham with relatively light development.
Uses, and consequently development, are limited due to significant natural, wildlife, wetlands,
recreational and scenic resources, risk of flooding, and steep slopes.

2414 AGRICULTURAL and FOREST (AF)
Purpose. The larger Agricultural and Forest Districts are located in the west portion of Town. The
larger areas are more remote from roads or utility services and are primarily forest land with some
agricultural uses. Recreational activities also utilize these lands. Some have steep slopes with
limiting soil conditions. Smaller districts are located in the southern part of the Town and these are
closer to developed roads, but steep slopes, soil conditions and agricultural value may limit
development potential.
Very low density development with limited uses is most appropriate given the minimal road access
and natural conditions of these areas and to maximize the preservation of open space.

2415 BELLOWS FALLS WATERSHED DISTRICT (WD)
Purpose. The Watershed district spans both sides of Interstate 91 and includes woodland owned by
the Bellows Falls Village Corporation. The Village’s source of water is Minards Pond located on the
east side of Interstate 91. The pond is supplied by springs and by the Farr and Ellis Brooks which
rise on the west side of the Interstate. The Watershed District protects the Village’s public water
supply. Proper maintenance and protection provides a continuing safe, healthy, and reliable water
supply.
No development should occur within the Watershed which has the potential for erosion,
contamination, or intense use.

Page 29
2416 COMMERCIAL – INDUSTRIAL (C-I)
Purpose. The C-I areas are located adjacent to major highways including U.S. Rte. 5 and Vt. Rte.
103. The districts range from areas with more industrial and mixed commercial uses to areas with
concentrations of transportation related functions. Some of the areas have access to public water
and sewer while others are dependent on on-site wells and wastewater disposal. While there are
some residential uses within these districts, the industrial and commercial uses may intrude with
long hours (24/7) and noise.
All areas are suitable in terrain and proximity to transportation facilities to be desirable by industry
and various commercial activities. Industrial and commercial uses within these districts would not
impact historic neighborhoods or important natural or cultural resources. These C-I districts are
critical for some uses which do not fit into the traditional downtown with its storefronts and scarce
off-street parking. Along Rte. 103, project site designs should avoid strip-type development, prevent
light pollution, provide landscaping, and limit curb cuts while providing adequate access to avoid
traffic hazards which would be caused by major traffic generators.

2417 SAXTONS RIVER DISTRICT (SR)
Purpose. This district falls along the lines of the Saxtons River Village boundary and includes both
the traditional mixed-use Main Street and residential side streets. The older residential area of the
Village has houses on relatively small lots with narrow frontages while the newer upper village area
has a more “suburban” development style. Main Street hosts retail, restaurant, religious and
cultural uses with scattered residences. The Warner Center campus provides area for mixed use
office and light industrial. Residences are in close proximity to the commercial sites. A portion of
Vermont Academy’s campus is within the SR district along the north boundary. With the exception
of the Main Street and Warner Center areas, the Village is mostly residential. The Main Street area
provides opportunity for commercial and other uses along with the Warner Center.
The purpose of the district is to allow mixed uses along Main Street and residential uses on the
village side streets. Uses generating noise and site lighting plans need to be mindful of the
residential areas abutting Main Street. Uses and site design should preserve and enhance the small
Village atmosphere and should avoid strip-type development and traffic hazards which would be
caused by significant traffic generators in unsuitable locations.

2418 MEETING HOUSE HISTORIC DISTRICT (MHHD)
Purpose. The Meeting House district encompasses the old Rockingham Village area and area
immediately adjacent on Rockingham Road/Vt. Rte. 103. It is a mix of small residential lots next to
open fields and woodland. The village of Rockingham developed around the old Rockingham
Meeting House, a National Historic Landmark. Most of the village was destroyed by fire in 1908.
Several of the surviving residences in this district are among the oldest in Rockingham. While these
houses are set close to the road, the Meeting House occupies the high point in the village. The view
from the Meeting House towards the immediate woodland, open fields and traditional houses
enhances the stark beauty of the Meeting House. The Rockingham Village Historic District was
named to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
Development and uses should be sensitive to preserving the historic appearance of the old village
and its style of buildings including the surrounding area. Future development must enhance the
visual character of the historic district by encouraging and regulating the compatibility of
architectural styles which reflect unique and established architectural traditions in order to
preserve and important part of the heritage of the Town.

2420 VILLAGE OF BELLOWS FALLS
2421 RESIDENTIAL (R-7)
Purpose. The Residential 7 area includes the lower and terrace areas of the older village and
includes a mix of single and multi-family homes. The lower area has relatively large homes on small
lots with narrow frontage on the street. The terrace areas are a mix of large and smaller homes,
again on small lots. The Morgan’s field area is more suburban in style having been developed post-
World War II and is primarily single-family. The Residential 7 district provides for dense residential
development in a compact neighborhood setting which is near municipal services and which is
served by municipal water and sewer. While the primary permitted uses intended are residential
dwellings and associated home-based uses, other types of residential accommodations, related
service enterprises, and public facilities are allowed in a manner which protects the residential
character of the neighborhoods within the district.
Given the small lots, retaining greenspace is a challenge and goal for this district. Other types of
uses should be allowed only in a manner which protects the residential character of the
neighborhood with careful consideration given to noise, traffic, and potential hours of operation to
prevent the loss of peace, quiet, and privacy essential to a residential environment.

2422 RESIDENTIAL (R-14)
Purpose. The Residential 14 zoning district is located on the hillside area of Bellows Falls. This was
an area developed after WWII and is more suburban in style as compared to the older lower village
area. Homes are primarily single family and separated from neighbors by generous yards. Many
lots are half-acre in area. Access to these districts is via steep roadways without pedestrian
sidewalks. The district provides low density residential development within village limits with most
lots having access to public water and sewer. The primary permitted use is single family and
associated home-based uses.
Future development should be allowed only in a manner which enhances the residential character
of the neighborhood with careful consideration given to noise, traffic and potential hours of
operation to prevent the loss of peace, quiet and privacy essential to a residential environment.

2423 ROADSIDE BUSINESS (RB-14)
Purpose. This is a small district on the north end of Bellows Falls Village was originally developed by
businesses more dependent on roadway traffic. The area is shallow in depth and located between
the east side of U.S. Rte. 5/Rockingham Road and the Connecticut River. Development constraints
include the small lot area, the steep embankments on the east, and site distances. Access drives
and curb cuts must be carefully planned to avoid traffic nuisances and dangers. Uses generating
noise need to be mindful of the residential areas to the west. Uses and site design should preserve
and enhance this approach into the Village and should avoid strip-type development and traffic
hazards which would be caused by major traffic generators in unsuitable locations.

2424 CENTRAL BUSINESS (CB-7)
Purpose. The CB7 district includes a mix of commercial, office and cultural uses with upper story
apartments in an area of town with on-street parking and limited potential to adversely impact
residential neighborhoods or natural resources. This district is the downtown core of the
community and retains its historic architectural styles, buildings close to the street, on-street
parking, pedestrian walkability, and a mixed use environment. It is separated from the residential
neighborhood to the west by the rise of land directly behind the downtown buildings, creating a
natural and effective buffer. This buffer makes the downtown area more suitable for uses which
have more activity during evening hours.
The purpose of the CB7 district is to maintain the traditional downtown as the social, commercial,
cultural and civic center of the community while protecting the area’s pedestrian scale, historic
character and economic vitality.

2425 CENTRAL BUSINESS EXPANSION (CBE-14)
Purpose. This district expands north and south from the CB7 district. It is a shallow district,
generally one lot deep. The lots face Rockingham and Westminster Streets, the main north-south
access into the downtown area. The district includes a mix of commercial uses with cultural
facilities. Off-street parking is limited on some lots. Office and cultural uses utilize large historic
former residential structures on relatively small lots. A few lots are large in comparison where
smaller residential lots were combined together to provide off-street parking.
The CBE-14 district provides area for non-residential uses to locate along heavily travelled public
streets. Uses generating noise and site lighting plans need to be mindful of the residential areas to
the west. Uses and site design should preserve and enhance the major visual approaches into the
Village and should avoid strip-type development which would impact the historic neighborhood and
traffic hazards which would be caused by major traffic generators in unsuitable locations.

2426 ISLAND INDUSTRIAL (IIND-14)
Purpose. This area is surrounded by water being located to the east of the hydroelectric canal and
west of the Connecticut River. It is separated from the core downtown by the canal and includes
old brick mill buildings which have been converted to other types of manufacturing and commercial
uses. While there is more separation between buildings than in the downtown, on-site parking is
not extensive due to the fact that the “Island” was used in the past predominately for
manufacturing and most employees at that time walked to work. Businesses that operate at this
location may utilize off-site parking lots. The purpose of this district is to promote the greatest
potential for re-development and to reclaim the Island’s role as a tourism destination and
employment center for the community.

2427 BELLOWS FALLS DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW DISTRICT (DDRD)
Purpose. The DDRD includes three distinct design sub-districts ranging from the traditional
downtown with storefronts, to the more industrial Island area and the former residential, now
commercial, areas which extend north and south from the concentrated downtown business
district.
The natural beauty and the visual and historic character of the Town represent an important asset
to the community by providing a source of pleasure for both residents and visitors, and also by
contributing substantially to the economic base of the community and to its tax base. In order to
protect these characteristics, it is necessary to encourage high quality building design and
construction that enhances the visual quality of the Downtown District, protects neighborhood and
community character, fosters the economic well-being of the community, and encourages
sensitivity to natural, architectural, cultural and historic resources.
The three distinct design sub-districts recognize that each sub district will have different, but
related, guidelines and criteria given the uses and existing buildings in the particular sub-district.
The standards established by this Article supplement and do not supersede other requirements of
these regulations. The standards of this Article shall apply to site plans, planned unit developments
and other applications for development approval as required by these regulations.
The Bellows Falls Downtown Design Review District (DDRD) is an overlay district. The Uses and
Dimensional Regulations of the underlying districts remain applicable therein. See Section 4700,
Design Review District.

2428 RIVERFRONT – 14 (R-14)
Purpose. This district is a narrow strip of land between the Connecticut River on the east and the
railroad tracks and a steep embankment on the west. It is long and narrow with easterly portions
subject to flooding. What is now open and wooded land was once a large paper mill site with
intense industrial use which was strongest in the early 1900s. Five remaining historic mill buildings
are located within the district which is crossed by high tension lines from the hydroelectric plant
and substations.
The district allows for recreational uses of land adjacent to the Connecticut River while also allowing
for other commercial or industrial uses which would not negatively impact this fragile area. While
few mill buildings remain, the district allows for adaptive re-use of these structures for activity
compatible with the recreational potential of riverfront property. Any facility in which more than
eighteen (18) people are incarcerated at any time or in which any person or persons are
incarcerated for seven (7) or more consecutive days is not compatible with the recreational
potential of riverfront property.

2600 NON-CONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
The following provisions shall apply to all structures and uses lawfully existing on the effective date of this
Bylaw, or any pertinent amendments thereto, which do not conform with the requirements set forth in this
Bylaw, and shall apply to all structures and uses that in the future do not conform by reason of any
subsequent amendment to this Bylaw.
1. NON-CONFORMING USES:
Non-conforming uses, as defined, are uses which were in existence prior to the enactment of the zoning
bylaw, or any amendments thereto. Pre-existing non-conforming uses are considered incompatible with
uses allowed in a district and should not be allowed to expand or intensify their activity in a manner that will
increase the degree of non-conformity or be detrimental to a neighborhood.
A. Any non-conforming use of a structure or land may be continued indefinitely, but it:
1. Shall not be changed to another non-conforming use without conditional use approval by the
Development Review Board provided that the Development Review Board finds that the proposed
use is no more non-conforming than the previous use, that the proposed use is the same or a more
restrictive use, and that no greater detrimental effect on the neighborhood or increase of the nonconformity
will result; examples of a change of a non-conforming use include, but are not limited to,
change from a retail grocery store to a retail convenience and drug store, or change from an
accountant business office to a real estate office use;
2. Shall not be re-established or restored without conditional use approval by the Development Review
Board if such use has been discontinued for a continuous period of 6 months or has been abandoned
for a period of 6 months regardless of the intent to resume the non-conforming use provided that
the Development Review Board finds that the proposed re-establishment or restoration is no more
non-conforming than the previous use, that the proposed use is the same or a more restrictive use,
and that no greater detrimental effect on the neighborhood or increase of the non-conformity will
result;
3. Shall not be re-established if such use has been replaced by a conforming use.
4. Shall not be re-established or restored if such use has been discontinued or a period of 18 months;
a. In all districts, except the C-I, IInd-14, SR, CB-7, CBE-14, RB-14, shall not be extended or enlarged
nor shall any external evidence of such use be increased by any means whatsoever;
b. In all other districts, shall not be extended or enlarged nor shall any external evidence of such use
be increased by any means whatsoever without conditional use approval of the Development
Review Board which shall find that no greater detrimental effect on the neighborhood will result;
Page 55
1. Examples of extension, enlargement, or increase of external evidence include, but are not
limited to, the following:
a. Increase in noise levels,
b. Increase in outside storage,
c. Extension of hours of operation,
d. Expansion into additional area of the property,
e. Enlargement of a structure.
5. A structure housing a non-conforming use, if destroyed or damaged by fire collapse, explosion or
similar cause may be reconstructed or repaired for the same or a less non-conforming use provided
that the non-conforming use in not extended, expanded or enlarged in any way, and provided that
such reconstruction or repair is completed within one year of the damage or destruction.
6. Shall not be extended so as to displace a conforming use;
7. A non-conforming use to be replaced by a conditional use must meet the criteria for a conditional use
permit;
8. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of a structure
housing a non-conforming use, provided that such action does not increase the degree of or create
any new non-conformance;
B. Factors the Development Review Board shall consider in reviewing non-conforming uses to determine if
the proposed use would be a detriment to the neighborhood are as follows:
1. Impact on abutters and the neighborhood;
2. The intensity of the existing non-conforming use and the intensity of the proposed non-conforming
use; and whether the proposed non-conforming use is a more restrictive use than the existing nonconforming
use;
3. Whether an increase in business hours or a change in hours from day to night will result;
4. Whether the proposed use will result in an increase in air pollution: i.e. noise, fumes, dust, odors;
5. Whether greater volumes of traffic will be generated than would normally be expected in the
neighborhood;
6. Whether there will be an increase in the numbers of employees;
7. Whether an increase in outdoor activity or outdoor storage will result;
8. Availability of adequate off-street parking as required by this Bylaw;
9. Distance from adjacent or nearby uses and structures, and the types of uses in the neighborhood;
10. Existing density in the area, and the density allowed under the zoning bylaw;
11. Location of existing structures on the lot;
12. Suitability to the character of the neighborhood;
13. Increased lighting at night so as to be detrimental to abutters or the neighborhood.
C. Any re-establishment, restoration, expansion or change to another non-conforming use shall require site
plan approval by the Development Review Board.
2. NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Page 56
Any structure, or part thereof, including signs, existing on the effective date of this Bylaw or any
amendments thereto, which is not in conformance with the zoning regulations covering building bulk,
dimensions, height, area, yards, density or loading requirements, where such structure conformed to all
applicable laws, ordinances and regulations prior to the enactment of such zoning regulations or any
amendments thereto, shall be considered a non-conforming structure.
A. Such non-conforming structure, except non-conforming signs, may continue to be used indefinitely, but
it:
1. Shall not be moved, enlarged, or re-constructed by any means whatsoever, without the approval of
the Development Review Board. In order to allow an increase in the non-compliance, the
Development Review Board must determine that no greater detrimental effect on the neighborhood
or abutting property will result.
2. A non-conforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other
similar cause may be reconstructed, repaired or restored, provided that the reconstruction or repair
results is a structure that is no more non-complying than the original structure, and that the work is
completed within one year of the damage or destruction. The Development Review Board may grant
one year extensions to this deadline if it is demonstrated that the delays were unavoidable and that
the work is progressing.
3. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming
structure provided that such action does not increase the degree of non-compliance.
4. An addition to, or expansion of, an existing non-conforming one or two family residential structure,
or its accessory buildings, which addition or expansion meets all required minimum dimensional
regulations for the zoning district in which it is located shall be approved by the Administrative
Officer; an addition to, or expansion of, an existing non-conforming one or two family residential
structure, or its accessory buildings, which addition or expansion does not meet the required
minimum dimensional regulations for the district in which it is located shall require approval by the
Development Review Board under I(a) above.
B. Factors the Development Review Board shall consider in reviewing non-conforming structures to
determine if the proposed alteration or reconstruction would be a detriment to the neighborhood are as
follows:
1. Impact on abutters and the neighborhood;
2. The configuration of the lot and lot size;
3. Retention of open space area as required in the zoning district;
4. Coverage on the subject lot and neighboring lots, and as required by the zoning bylaw in that district;
5. Whether a proposal increases an existing non-compliance; whether the increase is due to the
configuration of the location;
6. Distance from adjacent or nearby uses and structures;
7. Configuration and location of existing structures on the subject lot and neighboring lots;
8. Whether an increase in drainage off the lot and onto abutting properties will result;
9. Blockage of natural light to or views from abutter’s property of neighboring properties;
Page 57
10. Existing density in the neighborhood, and the density allowed under the zoning bylaw.
3. GENERAL
This section shall not be construed to permit any unsafe use or structure, or to affect any proper procedures
to regulate or prohibit the unsafe use of a structure or to prohibit or regulate any unsafe structure.
4. SIGNS
A sign which is non-conforming as of the date of this amendment may continue indefinitely, but shall not be
replaced, enlarged, extended, moved, changed in design or content, or otherwise altered, unless the sign as
so enlarged, extended, moved, altered or changed is in conformity with Section 3300 of this Bylaw.
A. A person shall not re-establish a non-conforming sign taken down for a purpose other than as set forth in
subparagraph 4(b), unless the sign as re-established conforms to all parts of Section 3300.
B. A person may re-establish a non-conforming sign which has been damaged by fire or other accident, but
only within one year from such damage or destruction.
C. A non-conforming sign removed for normal maintenance and repair such as painting and/or cleaning
may be re-established. [Amended section generally May 6, 1985, Effective May 27, 1985. Amended 1(a) and 1(e) February 18,

In accordance with Section 4414 of the Act, the following shall apply; [Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28,
2007]
3110 EXISTING SMALL LOTS
If a lot not conforming to the minimum lot size requirements in the zoning district in which is it located
subsequently comes under common ownership with one or more contiguous lots, the nonconforming lot
shall be deemed merged with the contiguous lot. However, a nonconforming lot shall not be deemed merged
and may be separately conveyed if all the following apply:
A. The lot is conveyed in its preexisting, nonconforming configuration.
B. The lot was legally subdivided on the effective date of this subsection.
C. The lot is connected to municipal water and municipal sanitary sewer. [Amended April 28, 1986, Effective May 19,

easement or right-of-way meeting the following requirements.
3120.1 RIGHTS OF WAY
Rights-of-way widths which afford the means of vehicular access shall be a minimum of 50’ wide except as
provided below:
A. Existing Lots. Existing lots of record served by a right-of-way of less than 50’ in width, recorded prior to
the date of this regulation, may be developed for the permitted and conditional uses allowed within the
zoning district upon finding that the applicable criteria there under are met. Such lot shall not be further
subdivided except as provided for in 3120.1(b) below.
B. Exception. A right-of-way serving no more than ONE lot which is no more than one (1) acre in area may
be reduced 20’ in width provided that the Development Review Board finds the lot meets the minimum
size requirement for the zoning district in which it is located and cannot be further subdivided.
C. Outside the Development. Private rights-of-way located on land other than the proposed development
but which provide access thereto shall be a minimum of 50’ wide for any development involving three or
more lots. Applicant shall submit information to the Development Review Board that such right-of-way

reclassified as Class 3, the developer must make arrangements for maintenance of the access road
satisfactory to the legislative body until such time as the legislative body may reclassify the road.
[Amended section generally July 7, 1998, Effective July 28, 1998. Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28, 2007]
3130 HOME OCCUPATIONS – HOME BUSINESSES
The Town of Rockingham recognizes the need of some residents to use their place of residence for limited
nonresidential activities. However, the Town believes that this must be balanced with the need to protect
the character of its residential areas and to protect these neighborhoods from the nuisances.
Business activities in residential areas may lead to changing the dominant residential character to a partially
commercial one. This can result from altering traffic patterns, police and fire service, parking requirements,
noise, and appearance including signs and lighting.
Many home occupations which were once “traditional” or “customary” have evolved into commercial
enterprises which are no longer compatible with residential neighborhoods while new occupations have
developed which do not have any impact on a residential area. Home-based businesses that employ
nonresidents may expand to the point that the business is no longer secondary to the residential use.
Further, home activities in more rural areas are less likely to disturb neighbors than those occurring in close
proximity to an abutter. This needs to be taken into account.
Therefore, two categories of nonresidential use are set forth in order to adequately provide for the needs
and protection of residents.
Page 60
Home Occupation approval allows for resident occupants to conduct limited nonresidential activity if
meeting the criteria set forth in the General Standards (Section 3131) and Category 1 – Home Occupations
(Section 3132) upon issuance of a zoning permit by the administrative officer.
Home Business approval is less restrictive and allows for limited outside employees for those uses meeting
the criteria set forth in the General Standards (Section 3131) and Category 2 – Home Businesses (Section
3133). A Home Business must be approved as a conditional use by the Development Review Board.
It is the intent of this section to:
A. Ensure the compatibility of home occupations and businesses with other uses permitted in the
residential districts;
B. Maintain and preserve the character of residential neighborhoods.
3131 GENERAL STANDARDS
The general standards set forth below are applicable to both Home Occupations and Home Business.
A. No home occupation or home business shall be permitted without the issuance of a zoning permit.
B. The home occupation or home business shall be operated by a person for whom the property is a
primary residence. The permit is valid only while that person(s) resides thereon.
C. The permit is not transferable from address to address.
D. In order to guarantee that a home occupation or home business, once authorized, will not become a
nuisance to the neighbors or otherwise violate these criteria, the permit shall be valid for a period of five
(5) years, and shall be renewed by the applicant. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to renew a
permit.
E. A home occupation or home business permit, once granted, may be renewed without additional
hearings, subject to the provisions of this subsection, by completing the renewal form provided by the
zoning office and paying the renewal fee.
F. Notice of a request for renewal without hearing shall be provided by the administrative officer to all
abutters and those properties located within 300’ of the applicant’s property by certified mail. Any
interested party, as defined under Title 24, V.S.A., section 4465(b), may request a hearing upon filing a
written request with the administrative officer. The request for hearing shall be filed no later than fifteen
(15) days from the date of the notice. [Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28, 2007]
3132 CATEGORY I-HOME OCCUPATIONS:
A home occupation is an accessory use so located and conducted that the average neighbor, under normal
circumstances, would not be aware of its existence other than for a nameplate/sign as permitted under this
bylaw.
Page 61
The standards for home occupations are intended to insure compatibility with the residential character of
the neighborhood, and that the home occupation is a clearly secondary or incidental use in relation to the
residential use of the main structure.
A. APPLICATION.
1. Application for home occupation permit shall be made to the Administrative Officer.
2. The administrative officer shall review the application and make findings that the application meets
the criteria set forth in subsection 3132(B) below.
3. Upon finding that the criteria set forth below are met, the administrative officer shall issue a home
occupation permit without hearing.
4. Notice of Permit issuance shall be provided by the administrative officer to all owners of abutting
properties and properties located within 300’ of the subject property including properties located
across a public or private road/right-of-way.
5. In cases where the Administrative Officer finds that the application is not within the scope of the
Home Occupation criteria, the application shall be denied. The applicant may submit the application
to the Development Review Board for hearing on appeal to determine if the proposed use is a home
occupation. No appeal hearing fee shall be required for appeal.
a. In the alternative, the applicant may re-submit an application for a home business. In such
instance, the fee for home business submittal shall be the difference between the base home
occupation fee and the conditional use hearing fee.
B. A HOME OCCUPATION SHALL MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
1. The occupation is one which is customary in residential areas.
2. The home occupation shall be conducted solely by resident occupants of the premises; there shall be
no nonresident personnel, profit or nonprofit employees or volunteers.
3. The home occupation shall be conducted wholly within the residence.
4. The home occupation use may increase customer, delivery, and pickup vehicular traffic flow and
parking by no more than one additional vehicle at a time on the lot. There shall be adequate on
street or off-street parking for residential and one customer vehicle, and deliveries and pick-ups.
5. Customers or deliveries shall not exceed that reasonably occurring for a residence including no more
than eight business visitors or customers per day, and no more than two deliveries or shipments of
products or materials per day.
6. Deliveries or shipments of supplies or products shall only be made by vehicles such as step-van type
vehicles. Nor shall the home occupation involve the use of vehicles with more than two (2) axles by
the residents as a part of the home occupation activity.
7. A home occupation use may have no more than one dedicated vehicle, limited to two axles, in
addition to personal vehicles not dedicated to the home occupation.
8. There shall be no outward appearance change, or variation from the residential character of the
residence or accessory buildings, and no outside storage of materials, equipment, products, or
Page 62
outside display except for a sign as permitted by this bylaw. There shall be no excessive lighting
which is incompatible with the characteristics of a residential neighborhood.
9. The occupation shall be clearly secondary to the dwelling used for living purposes. Secondary use is
that which occupies no more than 25% of the total floor area of a dwelling unit. Floor area of a
dwelling unit, in determining the percentage for home occupation, shall include the floor area of all
heated and ventilated and thereby habitable rooms and areas within the dwelling unit including
basements and habitable attic space.
10. No equipment or process shall be used in such home occupation which creates noise, vibration, glare,
fumes, odors, electrical interference or adversely affects water quality off-site. In the case of
electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used which created visual or audible
interference in any radio or television receivers, nor produces electrical or electromagnetic
interference off-site. A legally approved discharge of wastewater to an on-site wastewater disposal
system, publicly owned sewage treatment works, or surface water is not considered to adversely
affect water quality. In the case of a single family residence home occupation, off-site shall mean
beyond the boundaries of the lot. For other than a single family residence, off-site shall mean beyond
the confines of the subject dwelling including through vertical or horizontal party walls.
11. No acutely hazardous, explosive, or radioactive or other restricted materials shall be used or stored
on the site for home occupation use.
12. No retail or wholesale transactions (except for articles produced by the residents residing on the
premises) shall be made on the premises except via telephone or mail.
13. An activity which grows to exceed the definition and criteria of a home occupation will be required to
relocate to a district in which the activity is a permitted or conditional use, or apply and obtain a
home business permit if applicable. For example, the need for additional employees is usually an
indication that the home occupation has grown to such an extent that it should no longer be
considered incidental to the residential use but rather has become a home business or a full-fledged

3133 CATEGORY II – HOME BUSINESS
A home business is an accessory use of a dwelling or its accessory building(s) for gainful employment
involving the creation, provision, or sales of services and/or goods wherein a limited number of persons in
addition to the resident occupants may be employed.
Because other than resident occupants may be employed in a home business, this activity has a greater
chance of disturbing a neighborhood. Waste disposal and use of hazardous materials are also of concern.
Therefore, more scrutiny is needed for these applications.
This classification also recognizes that in less populated areas, home businesses are less likely to disturb the
residential peace of adjacent properties. Thus, lot size, location and proximity to neighbors are important
criteria in determining the impact a home business may have on the residential neighborhood.
A. APPLICATION.
Application for a Home Business permit shall be made to the Development Review Board and shall require
conditional use permit approval by the Board as provided for under section 1413 of this Bylaw.
1. A Home Business permit is a permit issued for a home business or commercial activity by the
Development Review Board after public hearing.
2. Notice of the Hearing must be given to owners of all properties adjoining the property subject to
development, without regard to any public right-of-way, and to all property owners within 300’ of
the applicant’s premises.
Page 64
B. IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL CRITERIA OF SECTION 1413, THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC
CRITERIA SHALL BE MET:
1. The home business shall be subordinate to the primary use of the property as a residence.
2. The home business shall be conducted wholly within the residence and/or accessory structures. Work
outside the residence or accessory structures is not allowed.
3. The home business shall be owned and conducted by the resident occupants of the premises. There
shall be no more than three (3) nonresident personnel, profit or nonprofit employees or volunteers
working at or from the premises.
4. There shall be no outward appearance change, or variation from the residential character of the
residence or accessory buildings, and no outside storage of materials, equipment, products, or
outside display except for a sign as permitted by this bylaw.
5. Retail sales and/or wholesale sales from the premises shall be prohibited except for the retail sales of
products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as a result of the home business.
However, orders previously made by telephone or at an off-premise sales party may be filled on the
premises. That is, direct sales of merchandise, supplies, or products off display shelves or racks is not
allowed, but a person may pick up an order placed earlier as described above. Except as allowed
above, stock for general retail sales shall not be stored on the premises. Stock used for work carried
on at or off the premises may be stored at the premises. For example, wallpaper ordered for a
specific job from a catalog.
6. In no case shall a home business be open to the public at times earlier than 8:00 a.m. nor later than 8
p.m.
7. No more than fifteen (15) customers or clients are allowed at the home business during any one day,
and no more than two deliveries or shipments of products or materials are allowed a day.
8. Any need for parking generated by the conduct of such home business shall be met with on-street or
off-street parking . Parking must be provided for at a location other than a required front yard. This
includes parking for vehicles dedicated to the business, employees and other personnel, customers,
and pick-ups and deliveries. Consideration shall be given to the impact of parking on the landscaping
and residential character of the neighborhood.
9. No equipment or process shall be used in such home business which creates noise, vibration, glare,
fumes, odors, or electrical interference detectable off the lot, or adversely impacts water quality
either on or off the lot. In the case of electrical interference, no equipment or process shall be used
which creates visual or audible interference in any radio or television receivers off the premises.
10. There shall be no lighting which is incompatible with the characteristics of a residential
neighborhood.
11. The home business shall not adversely affect the residential character of the neighborhood.
Consideration shall be given to parking, lighting, signs, traffic, screening, and other criteria included
within this bylaw.
12. Home businesses that attract customers, clients, or students to the premises for sales or services may
be more suitable for rural areas, and not suitable for smaller lots or multi-family lots.
Page 65
13. There are certain activities which may have a significant impact on residential neighborhoods
including but not limited to auto repair, auto body repair or painting, welding, and similar activities.
These activities will receive additional scrutiny; lot size, distance from neighbors, and location (for
example rural versus village) are critical considerations.
14. An activity which grows to exceed the definition and criteria of a home business will be required to
relocate to a district in which the activity is a permitted or conditional use.

4523.3 Waiver
The Development Review Board may waive one or more of the application filing requirements of this section
if it finds that such information is not needed for a thorough review of a proposed facility.
4533 Co-location Requirements
A. An application for a new wireless telecommunications facility shall not be approved unless the
Development Review Board finds that the facilities planned for the proposed structure cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved tower or structure due to one of the following reasons:
B. The propose antennas and equipment would exceed the structural or spatial capacity of the existing or
approved tower or facility, as documented by a qualified engineer licensed to practice in the State of
Vermont. Additionally, the existing or approved tower cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment, at a reasonable cost, to provide coverage and capacity
comparable to that of the proposed facility.
C. The proposed antennas and equipment would cause interference materially impacting the usefulness of
other existing or permitted equipment at the existing or approved tower or facility as documented by a
qualified engineer and such interference cannot be mitigated at a reasonable cost.
D. Existing or approved towers and structures cannot accommodate the planned equipment at a height
necessary to function reasonably or are too far from the area of needed coverage to function reasonably
as documented by a qualified engineer.
E. There is no existing or approved tower in the area in which coverage is sought.
F. Other unforeseen specific reasons make it unreasonable to locate the planned telecommunications
equipment upon an existing or approved tower or building.
G. The owner of an existing tower refuses to allow co-location.
H. Towers may be designed to allow for future placement of antennas upon the tower and to accept
antennas mounted at varying heights when overall permitted height allows. Towers may be designed
structurally and in all other respects to accommodate both applicant’s antennas and additional antennas
when overall permitted height allows.
I. The Board may disallow sharing of facilities upon finding that siting is improved under the conditions and
purposes of these Bylaws.
J. Horizontal co-location may be required as siting permits.
4534 Access Roads and Above Ground Facilities
Page 95
Where the construction of new wireless telecommunications towers and facilities requires construction of or
improvement to access roads, to the extent practicable, roads shall follow the contour of the land, and be
constructed or improved within forest or forest fringe areas, and not in open fields. Utility or services lines
shall be designed and located so as to minimize or prevent disruption to the scenic character or beauty of the
area.
4535 Tower and Antenna Design Requirements
It is recognized herein that most wireless communications towers are, by the nature of their design, readily
visible and cannot be completely screened from sight. Nevertheless, proposed facilities shall not have an
undue adverse effect on or unreasonably interfere with the view from any public park, natural scenic vista,
historic building or district, or major view corridor. Height and mass of facilities shall not exceed that which is
essential for the intended use and public safety.
A. Towers, antennas and any necessary support structures shall be designed to blend into the surrounding
environment through the use of color camouflaging and architectural treatment and other alternative
design tower structures as well as by minimal disruption of existing vegetation, except in cases in which
the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), state or federal authorities have prescribed design requirements
(including color and/or lighting.) The least visually intrusive facility shall be built. Designs which imitate
natural features, such as trees, may be required in visually sensitive locations. Materials used for the
exterior of any structure shall be of a type, color and location so as to minimize glare and the impact on
any scenic or historic areas, public vantage points including roads and park, or neighboring properties.
B. In order to protect public safety and to preserve the scenic character and appearance of the area, the
following shall apply:
1. A communications antenna may be located on any existing guyed tower, lattice tower, monopole,
electric utility transmission tower, fire tower or water tank.
2. Height, General
The height limit for towers, antennas and tower-related fixtures shall be not more than 20 feet above
the average height of the tree line measured within a 500 foot radius of the tower.
If there are not trees or buildings within 500 feet, the facilities shall not project higher than twenty
feet above the average height of nearby tree lines or buildings.
3. Height, Existing Structures. New antennas located on any of the following structures existing on the
effective date of this ordinance shall be exempt from the height restrictions of this ordinance
provided that there is no increase in the height of the existing structure: Water tanks, guyed towers,
lattice towers, fire towers, and monopoles.
4. Height, Existing Structures, (Utility). New antennas located on any of the following existing structures
shall be exempt from the height restrictions of this ordinance provided that there is no more than a
twenty foot increase in the height of the existing structure as a result of the installation of the
antenna: electrical transmission, and distribution towers, telephone poles and similar existing utility
structures. This exemption shall not apply within 300 feet of any scenic highway.
Page 96
5. Notwithstanding the above, additional height may be approved upon a finding by the Board that the
additional height is necessary in order to provide adequate coverage in the Town of Rockingham or
to accomplish co-location of facilities where co-location is determined beneficial to the community,
and the additional height will not cause an undue visual impact on the scenic character or
appearance of the area.
C. Screening Standards. The usefulness of wireless telecommunications facilities requires line of sight
capability, and some height above tree lines and nearby buildings. Total screening of such facilities is not
possible. Wireless service facilities shall be screened as follows:
1. Screened by Existing Buildings or Structures:
a. When a facility extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, every effort
shall be made to conceal the facility within or behind existing architectural features to limit its
visibility from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front
façade in order to limit their impact on the building’s silhouette.
b. Facilities which are side mounted shall blend with the existing building’s architecture and, if over
5 square feet, shall be painted or shielded with the material which is consistent with the design
features and materials of the building.
2. Screened by Vegetation:
a. If facilities are not screened from public viewing areas and neighboring properties by existing
buildings or structures, they shall be surrounded by buffers of dense tree growth and understory
that extends continuously in all directions for a minimum distance of two hundred feet from the
mount, security barrier, or designated clear area for access to equipment to create an effective
year round visual buffer. Ground mounted facilities shall provide a vegetated buffer of sufficient
height and depth to effectively screen the facility.
b. The vegetative buffer used for screening may be existing on the subject lot, planted on site, or be
within a landscape easement on an adjoining site. The vegetative buffer area shall be protected
by a landscape easement or be within the area of the telecommunication facility lease.
c. The easement or lease shall specify that the trees within the buffer shall not be removed or
topped, unless the trees are dead or dying and present a hazard to persons or property, or unless
the vegetative buffer area is included in a professionally prepared forest management plan which
is approved by the Board.
d. The Development Review Board shall determine the types of trees and plant materials and depth
of the needed buffer based on site conditions.
e. With approval of the Board, trees may be topped if found to interfere with reception or
transmission, and where continued growth would necessitate increasing the tower height.
3. Ground mounted equipment as well as buildings and structures accessory to a tower shall be
screened from view by suitable vegetation, except where a non-vegetative screen better
complements the architectural character of the surrounding neighborhood. Existing on-site
vegetation outside the immediate site for the wireless facility shall be preserved or improved.
Disturbance to existing topography shall be minimized unless the disturbance is demonstrated to
result in less visual impact on the facility from surrounding property and other vantage points.
Page 97
4. Color: Facilities which are side mounted on buildings shall be painted or constructed of materials to
match the color of the building material directly behind them. To the extent that any facilities extend
above the height of the vegetation immediately surrounding it, they shall be painted in a light gray or
light blue hue which blends with the sky and clouds.
5. Equipment Shelters for communication facilities shall be designed with one of the following
standards:
a. Shall be located in underground vaults; or
b. Shall be designed consistent with the traditional community architectural styles and materials; or
c. Shall be camouflaged behind an effective year round landscape buffer, equal to height of the
proposed building, and/or opaque fence. The fencing and/or landscaping buffer shall be
compatible with the neighborhood.
D. Protection of Scenic Ridges and Hillsides.
The Development Review Board shall determine the likely visual impact of any proposed
telecommunications facility. Based on the information presented, the Development Review Board may
require a redesign in order to minimize the visual impact on the scenic character and beauty of the area.
In determining whether or not a facility or tower would have an undue adverse visual impact, and when
setting conditions on the permit, the Development Review Board shall consider:
1. The period of time during which it would be viewed by persons traveling on public highways;
2. The frequency with which persons traveling on public highways will view the facility;
3. The degree to which it will be screened by existing vegetation, the topography of the land, and
existing structures;
4. Background features that will either obscure it or make it more conspicuous;
5. Its distance from key vantage points and the proportion of it which will be visible above the skyline or
tree line;
6. The sensitivity or unique value of the particular view affected by it; and
7. Significant disruption of a view shed that provides context to a historic or scenic resource.
4536 Amendments to Existing Wireless Telecommunications Facility Permit
An alteration or addition to a previously approved wireless telecommunications facility shall require a permit
amendment when any of the following are proposed:
A. Change in the number of buildings or facilities permitted on the site;
B. Addition or change of any equipment resulting in greater visibility or structural load, or additional height
of the tower, including profile of additional antennas, not specified in the original application;
C. Change in technology used for the facility.
4536.1 Reconstruction or Replacement of Existing Towers
Towers in existence at the time of adoption of this Ordinance may be reconstructed, altered, extended or
replaced on the same site, provided the Development Review Board finds that such reconstruction,
alteration, extension or replacement will not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than
Page 98
the existing structure. In making such a determination, the Development Review Board shall consider
whether the proposed reconstruction, alteration, extension or replacement will create public benefits such
as opportunities for co-location, improvements in public safety, and/or compatibility with surrounding
neighborhoods.
4537 Lighting
Unless required by the Federal Aviation Administration, no lighting of towers is permitted. In any case where
a tower is determined to need obstruction marking or lighting, the applicant must demonstrate that it has or
will request the least visually obtrusive marking and/or lighting scheme in FAA applications. Copies of
required FAA applications shall be submitted by the applicant. Heights may be reduced to eliminate the

4700 DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW DISTRICT
4710 PURPOSE
The natural beauty and the visual and historic character of the Town represent an important asset to the
community by providing a source of pleasure for both residents and visitors, and also by contributing
substantially to the economic base of the community and to its tax base. In order to protect these
characteristics, it is necessary to encourage high quality building design and construction that enhances the
visual quality of the Downtown District, protects neighborhood and community character, fosters the
economic well-being of the community, and encourages sensitivity to natural, architectural, cultural and
Page 103
historic resources. The standards established by this Article supplement and do not supersede other
requirements of these regulations. The standards of this Article shall apply to site plans, planned
developments and other applications for development approval as required by these regulations.
4711. ENABLING LEGISLATION
In accordance with 24 V. S. A. Chapter 117 4414(1) (E), the Downtown Design Review District has been
created to guide development in areas with particular historical, architectural, urban design, visual and
cultural significance. [Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28, 2007]
4712 GOALS OF THE DISTRICT
The Design Goals of the Downtown Design Review District are as follows:
A. To promote the use of buildings and property in a manner that benefits the community and individual
property owners, while preserving those features that have architectural, historic, or cultural merit.
B. To encourage public and private investments that may result in a positive contribution to visual harmony
and economic vitality, and protect these assets for future generations.
C. To attract visitors and encourage tourism by enhancing the visual character of the community.
D. To support and encourage changes to buildings and property which respect generally accepted design
principles.
E. To accommodate growth within the community and maintain the community character which attracts it.
4713 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
The Downtown Design Review District Boundaries are illustrated on the map entitled “Downtown Design
Review District.” These boundaries coincide with the Designated Downtown District. The Design Review
District encompasses the Central Business District in its entirety and portions of the Industrial and the Central
Business Expansion Districts.
4713.1 Design Sub-Districts
The following sub-districts have been established, recognizing that each district will have different, but
related, guidelines and criteria given the uses and existing buildings in the particular sub-district. The term
sub-district refers to that portion of the district that falls within the Downtown District and therefore is
subject to design review.
Central Business Sub-District (Zoning District CB 7)
The Central Business sub-district can be divided into three distinct neighborhoods: the downtown
commercial core, a transitional area leading into the downtown core, and a small residential area located on
Canal Street.
The downtown core has the greatest concentration of traditional commercial storefronts aligned along the
sidewalk of Rockingham Street, Canal Street, and Bridge Street in the area known as The Square. The
Page 104
majority of the buildings were built during the late 19th century and display characteristics of the Italianate,
Second Empire, Romanesque, and Queen Ann style. Interspersed among those buildings are scattered
examples of earlier vernacular Federal and Greek revival styles. Red brick is the predominant building
material in the downtown core, however there are buildings sheathed in wood, tin and other materials.
Most structures are two to three stories in height, although an occasional one-story building can be found.
Some of the upper stories are used for residential purposes. There are little to no side setbacks. Roof forms
in the downtown core appear predominantly flat, reflecting horizontal cornices and moldings of traditional
commercial structures. Unifying façade components include storefront display windows, defined entrances,
and sign bands. Additionally, the majority of upper story windows are vertically proportioned, with wood
frame and sash. Most upper story windows are spaced in a uniform pattern. Street trees line the sidewalks
and on-street parking is provided. Flush mounted signs and projecting signs represent the majority of signs
found in the downtown core.
In the transition area, the downtown core changes to wood frame commercial blocks along the incoming
streets of Rockingham, Canal and Westminster Streets. There is a mix of wood, vinyl, and concrete block
building materials used. Parking lots can be found on Westminster Street and on the west side of the
Rockingham Street, just north of The Square.
On Canal Street, a row of 19th century detached brick and wooden 1 ½ story houses, with gable ends facing
the street, align along the street. Small landscaped yards and residential parking areas are located on the
sides of the residences.
Industrial Sub-District (Zoning District IND 14)
The Industrial sub-district encompasses the entire island as well as a portion of land of off of Mill Street. Red
brick is the predominant building material, however renovations and expansions to buildings have
introduced other materials to the district. The roofs are generally flat. Historically, the island was a hub of
manufacturing. While industrial uses are still prevalent, commercial activities, including tourism, have
expanded into the district. The parcels are large and there is open space due to demolition of buildings and
municipal parking lots. The island serves as an intermodal transportation center with rail transportation
having a strong presence. The east end of Bridge Street serves as a gateway to the Central Business subdistrict.
Central Business Expansion Sub-District (Zoning District CBE-14 and part of Zoning District R-7)
The Central Business Expansion sub-district extends in a linear fashion to the north and south of the Central
Business sub-district. These are areas that serve as transition zones between the Central Business subdistrict
and residential areas. They are areas with a mix of new commercial structures and large residential
structures that have been, or have the potential to be, converted to commercial and institutional uses. The
lots are generally larger and parking is often provided on site, usually within the side setback. The height of
the buildings generally decrease the further away from the Central Business District the building is located.
Most of the converted residential structures are 2 ½ stories with the newer commercial buildings being only
one story with flat roofs. The roofs along Westminster Street are predominately gable and mansard. The
Page 105
structures are generally masonry and wood framed buildings that have been sheathed in various materials
such as clapboard, vinyl, brick, and concrete block. The northern section of the sub-district has open views to
the river.
4714 REVIEW PROCESS
A. Proposals that Require Design Review. Within the Design Review District no structure may be erected,
reconstructed, substantially altered, restored, moved, demolished, or changed in use or type of
occupancy without review of the design plans by the Administrative Officer and approval of design plans
by the Development Review Board. Mechanical equipment, utility connections, trash storage, and
fencing that will be located on the property are subject to design review. Development, renovation or
demolition may commence only if one of the following criteria is met:
1. The proposed development is an exempt activity as defined below; or
2. The Development Review Board has granted Design Review approval and a zoning permit for the
project has been issued by the Administrative Officer. In the cases of new land development, Design

4819 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW
4819.1 Criteria
The Development Review Board shall consider the following in its review of plans submitted:
A. The historic or architectural significance of the structure, its distinctive characteristics, and its
relationship to the historic significance of the surrounding area;
B. The relationship of the proposed changes in the exterior architectural features of the structure to the
remainder of the structure and to the surroundings area;
C. The general compatibility of the proposed exterior design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed
to be used;
D. The scale and general size of the buildings or structures in relationship to existing surroundings including
consideration of such factors as the building’s overall height, width, street frontage, number of stories,
roof type, façade openings (windows, doors, etc.) and architectural details.
E. Other factors, including yards, off-street parking, screening, fencing, entrance drives, sidewalks, signs,
lights, and/or landscaping which might affect the character of any building within the district, and similar
factors which relate to the setting for such structure or grouping of structures.
F. Any other factors including the environmental setting and aesthetic factors which the Development
Review Board deems to be pertinent. The Development Review Board may utilize and study the
information provided in the Meeting House Historic District Report, Building Surveys and Guidelines
Manual, the Design Review Resource Guide prepared for the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation,
December 1997, or other guidance documents as appropriate, in reviewing applications. The information
provided in these manuals is a guideline only, and is not controlling in the Development Review Board’s
decision.
G. Modern Accessory Structures: Modern life introduces non-historic elements into an historic district
which are necessary or have become convenient to modern life. In order to preserve the appearance of
a Historic District, such modern appliances and accessories, such as satellite dishes, swimming pools,
dumpsters, chain link fencing, should be carefully placed and screened from view where possible so as to
Page 118
minimize the visual impact upon the Historic District. [Amended Oct. 5, 1999 (f) generally, Effective Oct. 26, 1999.
Amended Jan. 4, 2005 deleting reference to DHD, Effective Jan. 25, 2005.]
4819.2 Review
When the Development Review Board is reviewing an application relating to an historic district the following
shall apply:
A. The Development Review Board shall be strict in its judgment of plans for those structures deemed to be
valuable under subsection 4812 of this section and shall adhere to the guidelines provided in subsection
4818.
B. The Development Review Board is not required to limit new construction, alteration, or repairs to the
architectural style of any one period, but may encourage compatible new design.
C. An application shall be approved only when the Development Review Board is satisfied that the proposed
plan will not materially impair the historic or architectural significance of the structure or surrounding
area.
D. If an application is submitted for the alteration of the exterior appearance of a structure or for the
dismantling, moving or demolition of a structure deemed to be significant under subsection 4920, the
Development Review Board shall meet with the owner of the structure to seek an economically feasible
plan for the preservation of the structure.
E. In the case of a structure deemed to be significant under subsections 4812 and 4920, the Development
Review Board may approve the proposed alteration, dismantling, moving or demolition despite
subdivision 4819.2(b) of this section if retention of the structure is not feasible because it is structurally
unsound. In order for the Development Review Board to deny a permit to dismantle, move, or demolish
a structure deemed to be significant under subsections 4812 and 4920, the Development Review Board
shall make findings based on an analysis of the structure by a structural engineer showing that it is
structurally sound and possible to repair. The cost of the analysis shall be borne by the Town. The
Development Review Board may consider the financial cost of rehabilitation or retention of the structure
in making its determination. [Amended Oct. 5, 1999 adding reference to section 4940, Effective Oct. 26, 1999. Amended Jan. 4,
2005 deleting reference to DHD, Effective Jan. 25, 2005.]

4900 HISTORIC DISTRICT AREA DESIGNATIONS
4910 MEETING HOUSE HISTORIC DISTRICT
There is hereby established an Historic District, to be known as the Meeting House Historic District: The
boundaries of the district are shown on a plan of the area known as the Meeting House District Zoning Map
which is made a part of these bylaws and attached thereto.
4910.1 History
This area was the center of the Town of Rockingham until the need for industry to locate near the rivers for
power resulted in the emergence of the villages of Bellows Falls and Saxtons River.
The Rockingham Meeting House is the focal point and it is located near the geographic center of the Town
where it was the custom to build houses of worship. In 1753 a meeting took place to lay out six acres for a
meeting house place. It was not until 1773 that it was voted to build a meeting house which was the
forerunner of the present Meeting House. In 1787 it was voted to build a larger meeting house and the
Meeting House as we know it was erected.
Many of the old buildings in Rockingham “Old Town” were destroyed in a disastrous fire in 1909 including
houses, stores, hotel and the post office. Today in the area around the Meeting House remain some of the
older houses of the Town dating back to the late 1700’s and early 1800’s.
4910.2 Purpose
The establishment of the Meeting House Historic District recognizes the historical value of this area. It is the
intent of this bylaw to guide future development in this Historic District in a manner that will be
complimentary to the historic flavor of the area and to preserve an important part of the heritage of the
Town of Rockingham.
4920 HISTORICAL DESIGNATION

DEFINITIONS
Accessory Use of Structure: A use of structure customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use of
building and located on the same lot.
Adequate Capacity: Capacity for wireless telephony is considered to be ‘adequate’ if the grade of services
(‘GOS’) is p.05 or better for median tele-traffic levels offered during the typical busy hour, as assessed by
direct measurement of the facility in question. The GOS shall be determined by the use of standard Erlang B
calculations. As call blocking may occur in either the land line or radio portions of wireless network,
Adequate Capacity for this regulation shall apply only to the capacity of the radio components. Where
capacity must be determined prior to the installation of the personal wireless services facility in questions,
Adequate Capacity shall be determined on the basis of a 20% busy hour (20% of all offered traffic occurring
within the busiest hour of the day), with total daily traffic based on aggregate estimated of the expected
traffic in the coverage area. [Amended: added May 21, 2002, Effective June 11, 2002.]
Adequate Coverage: Coverage for wireless telephony is ‘adequate’ within the area surrounding a base
station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmitted signal is such that most of
the time, transceivers properly installed and operated will be able to communicate with the base station
without objectionable noise (or excessive bit-error-rate for digital) and without calls being dropped. In the
case of cellular communications in a rural environment, this would be a signal strength of at least – 90 dBm.
It is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage as long as the signal regains its
strength further away from the base station. The outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage,
however, is that location past which the signal does not regain. [Amended: added May 21, 2002, Effective June 11, 2002.]
Agricultural Use: Land containing at least two acres which is used for raising livestock, or agricultural or
forest products, including farm structures and the storage of agricultural equipment; riding and boarding
stables; and as an accessory use, the sale of agricultural and forest products raised on the property.
Alteration: Structural change, change of location, or addition to a building or structure, excluding normal
maintenance and repair. Alterations shall include any construction that increases the size of the building or
structure in terms of height, length, width, footprint or gross floor area. Within the Design Review District
and the Historic District, alteration also encompasses changes to exterior architectural features. [Amended
generally Jan. 4, 2005, Effective Jan. 25, 2005. Amended August 7, 2007; Effective August 28, 2007]
Alternative Renewable Energy Resources: Energy available for collection or conversion from direct sunlight,
wind, running water, organically derived fuels including wood, agricultural sources, waste materials, waste
heat, and geothermal sources.
Antenna: A device for transmitting and/or receiving electromagnetic waves, which is attached to a tower or
other structure. [Amended: added May 21, 2002, Effective June 11, 2002.]
Antenna Height: The vertical distance measured from the base of the antenna support structure at grade to
the highest point of the structure. If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average between
Page 123
the highest and lowest grades shall be used in calculating the antenna height. [Amended: added May 21, 2002,
Effective June 11, 2002.]
Antenna Support Structure: Any pole, telescoping mast, tower tripod, or any other structure which supports
a device used in the transmitting and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. [Amended: added May 21, 2002,
Effective June 11, 2002.]
Applicant (as it applies to telecommunication facility applications): A person who applies for a
telecommunications facility siting. An applicant can be the telecommunications service provider with the
owner’s written permission (or other legally designated representative) or the owner of the property.
[Amended: added May 21, 2002, Effective June 11, 2002.]
Architectural Feature: For purposes of the Design Review District and the Historic District, architectural
features are the architectural elements embodying style, design, general arrangement and components of all
